| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with the DHCPv6 server feature enabled are vulnerable. The DHCPv6 server feature is not enabled by default. Cisco devices that are configured as DHCPv6 clients or relay agents are not affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether a Cisco IOS device or Cisco IOS XE device is configured as a DHCPv6 server, issue the **show ipv6 dhcp interface** command.      The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is not vulnerable because it is not configured as a DHCPv6 server: ```   Router#show ipv6 dhcp interface   Router#      ``` The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCPv6 server feature is applied to the FastEthernet0/0 interface and DHCPv6 server pool DHCPv6-stateful is used: ```   Router#show ipv6 dhcp interface   FastEthernet0/0 is in server mode    Using pool: DHCPv6-stateful    Preference value: 0    Hint from client: ignored    Rapid-Commit: disabled   Router#      ``` The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCPv6 server feature is applied to the FastEthernet0/0 and FastEthernet0/1 interfaces: ```   Router#show ipv6 dhcp interface | include server   FastEthernet0/0 is in server mode   FastEthernet0/1 is in server mode   Router#      ```  To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The DHCPv6 Server feature in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software is a DHCPv6 server implementation that assigns and manages IPv6 addresses, prefixes, and other information from specified address pools to DHCPv6 clients.      A vulnerability in the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) server implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of an affected device.      The vulnerability is triggered when the affected Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE device attempts to process a crafted DHCPv6 packet. Valid DHCPv6 packets will not trigger this vulnerability. DHCPv6 packets that the Cisco IOS device forwards (for example, transit DHCPv6 traffic) will not trigger this vulnerability.      Both packets sent to link-scoped multicast address ff02::1:2 (All\_DHCP\_Relay\_Agents\_and\_Servers) and the interface IPv6 unicast address of the DHCPv6 server will trigger this vulnerability.      This vulnerability can only be exploited via malformed IPv6 packets. Cisco IOS devices that are configured as a DHCP version 4 (DHCP) server for IP version 4 (IPv4) are not affected by this vulnerability.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCum90081](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum90081) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only). This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-3359.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.          Cisco IOS Software Cisco has provided a tool to help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) allows customers to perform the following tasks:    + Initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from a local system   + Enter **show version** command output for the tool to parse   + Create a customized search by including all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all advisories in the September 2015 bundled publication The tool will identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a queried software release and the earliest release that corrects all vulnerabilities in each Cisco Security Advisory ("First Fixed"). If applicable, the tool will also return the earliest possible release that corrects all vulnerabilities in all displayed advisories ("Combined First Fixed"). Please visit the [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) or simply enter a Cisco IOS Software release in the following field to determine whether it is affected by any of the advisories in this bundled publication.

A vulnerability in the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) server implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of an affected device.
Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:
https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-dhcpv6["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140924-dhcpv6"]
Note: The September 24, 2014, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes six Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Individual publication links are in Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication at the following link:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html["http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco\_ERP\_sep14.html"]

Cisco devices that are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with the DHCPv6 server feature enabled are vulnerable. The DHCPv6 server feature is not enabled by default. Cisco devices that are configured as DHCPv6 clients or relay agents are not affected by this vulnerability.
To determine whether a Cisco IOS device or Cisco IOS XE device is configured as a DHCPv6 server, issue the show ipv6 dhcp interface command.
The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is not vulnerable because it is not configured as a DHCPv6 server:
Router#show ipv6 dhcp interface
Router#
The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCPv6 server feature is applied to the FastEthernet0/0 interface and DHCPv6 server pool DHCPv6-stateful is used:
Router#show ipv6 dhcp interface
FastEthernet0/0 is in server mode
Using pool: DHCPv6-stateful
Preference value: 0
Hint from client: ignored
Rapid-Commit: disabled
Router#
The following example shows a Cisco IOS device that is affected by this vulnerability. The device is vulnerable because the DHCPv6 server feature is applied to the FastEthernet0/0 and FastEthernet0/1 interfaces:
Router#show ipv6 dhcp interface | include server
FastEthernet0/0 is in server mode
FastEthernet0/1 is in server mode
Router#
To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the show version command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the show version command or may provide different output.
The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:
Router> show version
Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)

Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.
No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.
The DHCPv6 Server feature in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software is a DHCPv6 server implementation that assigns and manages IPv6 addresses, prefixes, and other information from specified address pools to DHCPv6 clients.
A vulnerability in the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) server implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DHCPv6 packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak and eventual reload of an affected device.
The vulnerability is triggered when the affected Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE device attempts to process a crafted DHCPv6 packet. Valid DHCPv6 packets will not trigger this vulnerability. DHCPv6 packets that the Cisco IOS device forwards (for example, transit DHCPv6 traffic) will not trigger this vulnerability.
Both packets sent to link-scoped multicast address ff02::1:2 (All\_DHCP\_Relay\_Agents\_and\_Servers) and the interface IPv6 unicast address of the DHCPv6 server will trigger this vulnerability.
This vulnerability can only be exploited via malformed IPv6 packets. Cisco IOS devices that are configured as a DHCP version 4 (DHCP) server for IP version 4 (IPv4) are not affected by this vulnerability.
This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID CSCum90081["https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum90081"] (registered["https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do"] customers only). This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-3359.
There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt["http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt"] and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.
