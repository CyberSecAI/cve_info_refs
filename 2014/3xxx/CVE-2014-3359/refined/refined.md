Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-3359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper parsing of malformed DHCPv6 packets by the DHCPv6 server implementation in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A vulnerability exists in the way Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE software process DHCPv6 packets. Specifically, malformed packets can trigger a flaw in parsing logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send malformed DHCPv6 packets to an affected device.
- Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak, which can eventually cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attackers can send malicious DHCPv6 packets to the affected device.
- The attack can be triggered by sending packets to the link-scoped multicast address ff02::1:2 or to the interface IPv6 unicast address of the DHCPv6 server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 packets to the targeted device.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability to craft the malformed DHCPv6 packets.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the affected device attempts to process a crafted DHCPv6 packet. Valid DHCPv6 packets do not trigger this issue.
- The vulnerability is specific to the DHCPv6 server implementation. Devices configured as DHCPv6 clients or relay agents are not vulnerable.
- Only IPv6 traffic is affected by this vulnerability; IPv4 DHCP servers are not vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is tracked under Cisco bug ID CSCum90081.
- Cisco has provided software updates to address this issue.
