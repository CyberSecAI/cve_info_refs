Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-3759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient input validation within the "si_bibtex" Typo3 extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection:**  Inadequate input sanitization in the "search" and "list" functionalities allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code into database queries.
2.  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The "import" function does not properly sanitize user-supplied data, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code that is then persistently stored and displayed to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    -   Full access to the Typo3 database with the privileges of the database user.
    -   Potential to retrieve sensitive information, including backend user passwords, leading to a complete system compromise.

2.  **Persistent XSS:**
    -   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected web page.
    -   Potential for session hijacking, user impersonation, defacement of the website, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** Exploiting the "search" and "list" functionalities of the extension by manipulating input parameters. This could potentially be done by unauthenticated users, depending on the context of the application.
2.  **Persistent XSS:** Using the "import" functionality to inject malicious code, which will then be triggered when other users access the "search" or "list" features of the extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- For SQL Injection, the attacker needs to be able to interact with the "search" and "list" features of the "si_bibtex" extension and manipulate input parameters. Depending on the extension setup, this might be achievable by unauthenticated users.
- For Persistent XSS, the attacker needs to be able to use the "import" function of the extension. The impact would then affect other users who utilize the search or list functionalities.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory notes that no patch or workaround was available at the time of the report, and recommends uninstalling the extension as a mitigation.
- The vulnerable version identified is `si_bibtex 0.2.3`.
- The vulnerabilities were discovered by B. Schildendorfer of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab on 2013-09-24.
- Vendor was contacted on 2013-11-05 and a security advisory was released on 2014-04-30 due to lack of patch.
