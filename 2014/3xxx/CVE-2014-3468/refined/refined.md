{
  "CVE-2014-3468": {
    "description": "The asn1_get_bit_der function in GNU Libtasn1 before 3.6 does not properly report an error when a negative bit length is identified, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause out-of-bounds access via crafted ASN.1 data.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `asn1_get_bit_der` function in libtasn1 could return a negative bit length when parsing ASN.1 data, leading to out-of-bounds access.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper error handling when decoding ASN.1 data.",
        "Incorrect calculation of bit length.",
        "Potential for out-of-bounds access."
      ],
      "impact": "Out-of-bounds access in an application using libtasn1. This could potentially lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution if an application tries to terminate the value with a NUL byte or otherwise performs further operations using the incorrect length.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted ASN.1 input",
        "Network-based attacks through applications that handle ASN.1 data."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply crafted ASN.1 data to a vulnerable application that uses the libtasn1 library. This could happen over a network or by other means depending on the application."
