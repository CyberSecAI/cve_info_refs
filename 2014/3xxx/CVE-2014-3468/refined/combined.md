| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 18:57:56 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash.  The libtasn1 library is used by the GnuTLS library to parse X.509 certificates.  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier use bundled libtasn1, packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later depend on the library provided by a separate libtasn1 package.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 18:31:12 UTC  ``` It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der() could incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from ASN.1 input.  This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in an application using libtasn1, for example in case if application tried to terminate read value with NUL byte.  The following upstream commit corrects the issue and causes the function to report error rather than return negative length value: <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libtasn1.git/commit/?id=1c3ccb3e040bf13e342ee60bc23b21b97b11923f>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-29 11:41:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgment:  Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:18:04 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in libtasn1 3.6: <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-libtasn1/2014-05/msg00006.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:26:28 UTC  ```  Created libtasn1 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1103087](show_bug.cgi?id=1103087 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 libtasn1: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:26:31 UTC  ```  Created mingw-libtasn1 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1103088](show_bug.cgi?id=1103088 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 mingw-libtasn1: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-30 08:26:34 UTC  ```  Created mingw32-gnutls tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1103089](show_bug.cgi?id=1103089 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3469 CVE-2014-3468 mingw32-gnutls: various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-03 16:09:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:0596 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0596.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-06-03 16:10:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2014:0594 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0594.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1102323#c10)  Fedora Update System    2014-06-04 07:52:08 UTC  ``` libtasn1-3.6-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

## Updated libtasn1 packages fix CVE-2014-3467-9

Publication date: 02 Jun 2014

Modification date: 02 Jun 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-3467](CVE-2014-3467.html)
,
[CVE-2014-3468](CVE-2014-3468.html)
,
[CVE-2014-3469](CVE-2014-3469.html)

## Description

```
Updated libtasn1 packages fix security vulnerabilities:

Multiple buffer boundary check issues were discovered in libtasn1 library,
causing it to read beyond the boundary of an allocated buffer.  An untrusted
ASN.1 input could cause an application using the library to crash
(CVE-2014-3467).

It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der() could
incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from ASN.1 input.
This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in an application using
libtasn1, for example in case if application tried to terminate read value
with NUL byte (CVE-2014-3468).

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's
asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application
called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine
the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input,
libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing
an application using the library to crash (CVE-2014-3469).

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-3466)

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

# RHSA-2014:0596 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: libtasn1 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0596)

## Topic

Updated libtasn1 packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtasn1 library provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) parsing
and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding
and decoding functions.

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.

All libtasn1 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the libtasn1 library must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# GnuTLS Security update for Novell Open Enterprise Server 11 SP1.

* **Document ID:***7015303*
* **Creation Date:**01-Jul-2014
* **Modified Date:**01-Jul-2014
* + **Micro Focus Products:**Open Enterprise Server
  + **SUSE Products:**SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

## Environment

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 Service Pack 2 (SLES 11 SP2)
Novell Open Enterprise Server 11 (OES 11) Linux Support Pack 1

## Situation

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 General support has ended on 31 Jan 2014.
Novell Open Enterprise Server 11 SP1 General support ends on 29 Jan 2015.

A number of GnuTLS related Security Vulnerabilities were reported.

Due to the current support status for Novell Open Enterprise Server 11
SP1, the Novell and SUSE teams have closely collaborated to make these
fix available for Novell OES11 SP1 customers.

## Resolution

The oes11sp1-gnutls-9429 patch containing the
mentioned fixes for SLES 11 SP2 is released through the public OES11 SP1
patch repositories on 30 June 2014.

GnuTLS has been patched to ensure proper parsing of session ids during the
TLS/SSL handshake. Additionally three issues inherited from libtasn1 have been
fixed.

Further information is available at
[http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3](http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3 "http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3")

These security issues have been fixed:

* Possible memory corruption during connect (CVE-2014-3466)
* Multiple boundary check issues could allow DoS (CVE-2014-3467)
* asn1\_get\_bit\_der() can return negative bit length (CVE-2014-3468)
* Possible DoS by NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2014-3469)

# CVE-2014-3466

* [ULN](https://linux.oracle.com) >
* [Oracle Linux CVE repository](https://linux.oracle.com/cve)  >
* CVE-2014-3466

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-05-30 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

See more information about CVE-2014-3466 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3466) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3466)

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-05-25 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

The asn1\_get\_bit\_der function in GNU Libtasn1 before 3.6 does not properly report an error when a negative bit length is identified, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause out-of-bounds access via crafted ASN.1 data.

## GNU Libtasn1 3.6 released

---

| **From**: | Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos |

| **Subject**: | GNU Libtasn1 3.6 released |
| **Date**: | Sun, 25 May 2014 21:57:23 +0200 |

```
Hello,
 I have just released libtasn1 3.6. This release fixes possible
invalid memory accesses by the DER decoder found using the Codenomicon
TLS test suite. The changes since the last release follow.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.6 (released 2014-05-25) [stable]
- Corrected an off-by-one error in ASN.1 DER tag decoding.
- Several improvements and new safety checks on DER decoding;
  issues found using Codenomicon TLS test suite.
- Marked asn1_der_decoding_element() as deprecated. Use
  asn1_der_decoding() instead.

GNU Libtasn1 is a standalone library written in C for manipulating ASN.1
objects including DER/BER encoding/decoding.  GNU Libtasn1 is used by
GnuTLS to handle X.509 structures and by GNU Shishi to handle Kerberos
V5 structures.

# GnuTLS Security update for Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 SP3.

* **Document ID:***7015302*
* **Creation Date:**01-Jul-2014
* **Modified Date:**01-Jul-2014
* + **Micro Focus Products:**Open Enterprise Server
  + **SUSE Products:**SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

## Environment

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 Service Pack 4 (SLES 10 SP4)
Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 (OES 2) Linux Support Pack 3

## Situation

 SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4 General support has ended on 31 July 2013.
Novell Open Enterprise Server 2 SP3 General support has ended on  31 July 2013.

A number of GnuTLS related Security Vulnerabilities were reported.

Due to the current extended support status for Novell Open
Enterprise Server 2 SP3, the Novell and SUSE teams have closely
collaborated to make these fix available for Novell OES2 SP3 customers.

## Resolution

The oes2sp3-gnutls-8896 patch containing the mentioned fixes for SLES 10 SP4 is released through the public OES2 SP3 patch repositories on 30 June 2014.

GnuTLS has been patched to ensure proper parsing of session ids during the
TLS/SSL handshake. Additionally three issues inherited from libtasn1 have been
fixed.

Further information is available at
[http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3](http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3 "http://www.gnutls.org/security.html#GNUTLS-SA-2014-3")

These security issues have been fixed:

* Possible memory corruption during connect (CVE-2014-3466)
* Multiple boundary check issues could allow DoS (CVE-2014-3467)
* asn1\_get\_bit\_der() can return negative bit length (CVE-2014-3468)
* Possible DoS by NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2014-3469)

Security Issues:

* [CVE-2014-3466](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3466 "CVE-2014-3466")
* [CVE-2014-3467](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3467 "CVE-2014-3467")

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=13456#c0)  David Walser    2014-05-30 17:08:38 CEST  ``` Security issues fixed upstream in libtasn1 have been made public today (May 30): <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/30/2>  Updated packages uploaded for Mageia 3, Mageia 4, and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated libtasn1 packages fix security vulnerabilities:  Multiple buffer boundary check issues were discovered in libtasn1 library, causing it to read beyond the boundary of an allocated buffer.  An untrusted ASN.1 input could cause an application using the library to crash (CVE-2014-3467).  It was discovered that libtasn1 library function asn1_get_bit_der() could incorrectly report negative bit length of the value read from ASN.1 input. This could possibly lead to an out of bounds access in an application using libtasn1, for example in case if application tried to terminate read value with NUL byte (CVE-2014-3468).  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash (CVE-2014-3469).

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0594)

## Topic

Updated gnutls packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GnuTLS library provides support for cryptographic algorithms and for
protocols such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). The gnutls packages also
include the libtasn1 library, which provides Abstract Syntax Notation One
(ASN.1) parsing and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules
(DER) encoding and decoding functions.

A flaw was found in the way GnuTLS parsed session IDs from ServerHello
messages of the TLS/SSL handshake. A malicious server could use this flaw
to send an excessively long session ID value, which would trigger a buffer
overflow in a connecting TLS/SSL client application using GnuTLS, causing
the client application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2014-3466)

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.
Upstream acknowledges Joonas Kuorilehto of Codenomicon as the original
reporter of CVE-2014-3466.

Users of GnuTLS are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the GnuTLS or libtasn1 library must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102022#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 11:07:10 UTC  ``` Multiple buffer boundary check issues were discovered in libtasn1 library, causing it to read beyond the boundary of an allocated buffer.  An untrusted ASN.1 input could cause an application using the library to crash.  The libtasn1 library is used by the GnuTLS library to parse X.509 certificates.  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier use bundled libtasn1, packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later depend on the library provided by a separate libtasn1 package.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0687)

## Topic

Updated libtasn1 packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The libtasn1 library provides Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) parsing
and structures management, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoding
and decoding functions.

It was discovered that the asn1\_get\_bit\_der() function of the libtasn1
library incorrectly reported the length of ASN.1-encoded data. Specially
crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using libtasn1 to perform
an out-of-bounds access operation, causing the application to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3468)

Multiple incorrect buffer boundary check issues were discovered in
libtasn1. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an application using
libtasn1 to crash. (CVE-2014-3467)

Multiple NULL pointer dereference flaws were found in libtasn1's
asn1\_read\_value() function. Specially crafted ASN.1 input could cause an
application using libtasn1 to crash, if the application used the
aforementioned function in a certain way. (CVE-2014-3469)

Red Hat would like to thank GnuTLS upstream for reporting these issues.

All libtasn1 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues. For the update to take effect, all applications
linked to the libtasn1 library must be restarted.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1102329#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 18:57:56 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in libtasn1's asn1_read_value_type() / asn1_read_value() function. If an application called the function with a NULL value for an ivalue argument to determine the amount of memory needed to store data to be read from the ASN.1 input, libtasn1 could incorrectly attempt to dereference the NULL pointer, causing an application using the library to crash.  The libtasn1 library is used by the GnuTLS library to parse X.509 certificates.  The gnutls packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier use bundled libtasn1, packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later depend on the library provided by a separate libtasn1 package.

Package        : libtasn1-3
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3467 CVE-2014-3468 CVE-2014-3469

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libtasn1-3, a library that
manages ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures. An attacker
could use those to cause a denial-of-service via out-of-bounds access
or NULL pointer dereference.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-2+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
