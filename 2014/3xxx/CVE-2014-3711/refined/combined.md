FreeBSD-SA-14:22.namei Security Advisory
The FreeBSD Project
Topic: memory leak in sandboxed namei lookup
Category: core
Module: kernel
Announced: 2014-10-21
Credits: Mateusz Guzik
Affects: FreeBSD 9.1 and later.
Corrected: 2014-10-21 20:20:07 UTC (stable/10, 10.1-PRERELEASE)
2014-10-21 20:20:36 UTC (releng/10.1, 10.1-RC2-p1)

CVE Name: CVE-2014-3711
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The namei kernel facility is responsible for performing and caching
translations from path names to file system objects (vnodes).
Capsicum is a lightweight capability and sandbox framework using a
hybrid capability system model. It is often used to create sandboxes
for applications that process data from untrusted sources.
II. Problem Description
The namei facility will leak a small amount of kernel memory every
time a sandboxed process looks up a nonexistent path name.
III. Impact
A remote attacker that can cause a sandboxed process (for instance, a
web server) to look up a large number of nonexistent path names can
cause memory exhaustion.
IV. Workaround
Systems that do not have Capsicum enabled or do not run services that
use Capsicum are not vulnerable.
On systems that have Capsicum compiled into the kernel, it can be
disabled by executing the following command as root:
# sysctl kern.features.security\_capabilities=0
Services that use Capsicum are usually able to run without it, albeit
with reduced security.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
3) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 9.x]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:22/namei-9.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:22/namei-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify namei-9.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 10.x]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:22/namei-10.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:22/namei-10.patch.asc
# gpg --verify namei-10.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile your kernel as described in
 and reboot the
system.
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/9/ r273412
releng/9.1/ r273415
releng/9.2/ r273415

To see which files were modified by a particular revision, run the
following command, replacing NNNNNN with the revision number, on a
machine with Subversion installed:
# svn diff -cNNNNNN --summarize svn://svn.freebsd.org/base

Package        : kfreebsd-9
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3711 CVE-2014-3952 CVE-2014-3953 CVE-2014-8476

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or information disclosure.

CVE-2014-3711

    Denial of service through memory leak in sandboxed namei lookups.

CVE-2014-3952

    Kernel memory disclosure in sockbuf control messages.

CVE-2014-3953

    Kernel memory disclosure in SCTP. This update disables SCTP, since the
    userspace tools shipped in Wheezy didn't support SCTP anyway.

CVE-2014-8476

    Kernel stack disclosure in setlogin() and getlogin().

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.8.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
