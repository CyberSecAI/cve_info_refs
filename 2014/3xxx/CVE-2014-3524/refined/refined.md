Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3524:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way LibreOffice and OpenOffice Calc handle CSV files and DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) formulas. Specifically, it involves a command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The core issue is that specially crafted CSV documents can be used to inject commands. This implies a lack of proper sanitization or validation of data within the CSV file, particularly within DDE formulas.
*   **DDE Formulas:** The use of DDE formulas, designed for inter-application communication, is exploited to inject and execute arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the application (LibreOffice or OpenOffice).
*   **Potential Denial of Service:** Although not the primary impact, the vulnerability could also lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious CSV Document:** The primary attack vector involves enticing a user to open a malicious CSV document specifically crafted to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely, meaning an attacker doesn't require local access to the victim's system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious CSV Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create specially crafted CSV documents that include the malicious commands embedded within DDE formulas.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious CSV file. This can be done via email, web download or any other means of file transfer.
*   **No local access is needed:** The attacker does not need to have local access to the user's system.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects both LibreOffice and Apache OpenOffice.
*   Patches were released in LibreOffice 4.3.1 and 4.2.6, as well as OpenOffice 4.1.1
*   The vulnerability is considered "Important" in terms of severity.
*   The issue was discovered by Rohan Durve and James Kettle of Context Information Security.
*   The vulnerability impacts Windows versions of the applications.

In summary, CVE-2014-3524 is a critical vulnerability that allows for arbitrary command execution through specially crafted CSV files exploiting DDE formulas in LibreOffice and OpenOffice Calc. It can be exploited remotely, requiring users to open a malicious file.
