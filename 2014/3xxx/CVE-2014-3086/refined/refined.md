Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3086:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is not explicitly stated beyond "a security vulnerability has been identified" in the IBM documentation, but it is related to a Java SE issue disclosed in the Oracle July 2014 Critical Patch Update.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The vulnerability allows "untrusted code running under a security manager to escalate its privileges". This indicates a flaw in how the security manager handles certain operations, potentially allowing a malicious code to bypass security restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The impact of successful exploitation is privilege escalation. This would allow an attacker to execute code with higher privileges than intended, potentially compromising the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through untrusted code running within a Java application that has a security manager. This implies a local attack vector where malicious code needs to be present in the application's execution environment.
*   The vulnerability is present in the Java Runtime Environment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to introduce and execute untrusted code within a Java application that is using a security manager.
*   The attacker's code must be able to leverage the specific vulnerability to escalate privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by updating the Java Runtime Environment.
*   The vulnerability affects IBM WebSphere Real Time and IBM SDK, Java Technology Edition.
*   The fix is included in specific service refreshes and fix packs of the affected products and versions.
