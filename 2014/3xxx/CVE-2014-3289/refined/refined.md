Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-3289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `date_range` parameter within the reports overview page of the Cisco AsyncOS management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious script code into the `date_range` parameter. The injected script is then reflected back to the user, executing in their browser context when they access the crafted URL.
- **CWE-79:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79, which is "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or script code within the user's browser session.
- **End-user Browser Context:** The attacker's script runs in the context of the end-user's browser session, potentially granting access to sensitive information or allowing malicious actions to be performed on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with the malicious script in the `date_range` parameter, and then tricking a user into clicking on it or accessing the manipulated link.
- **Reflected XSS:** The attack is characterized as reflected, meaning the injected script isn't stored on the server, but is instead returned in the response after being sent in a request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker must persuade a user to visit a specially crafted link.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco Email Security Appliance 8.0 and earlier
*   Cisco Web Security Appliance 8.0 and earlier
*   Content Security Management Appliance 8.3 and earlier

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by William Costa.
- Cisco has released a patch to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in the reports overview page of the management interface.
- The specific URL component vulnerable is `/monitor/reports/overview?printable=False&date_range`.
