Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a race condition in how `eDeploy` handles temporary files. Specifically, multiple temporary file race conditions were found within `eDeploy`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Tmp File Race Conditions:** The software uses temporary files in a way that allows for race conditions, where multiple processes can attempt to access or modify the same file simultaneously, leading to unpredictable and potentially exploitable behavior.
*   **Insecure File Handling:**  Multiple scripts within eDeploy create temporary files in the `/tmp` directory without proper precautions for concurrent access. Some of the problematic file paths include:
    *   `/tmp/edeploy.lock`
    *   `/tmp/vmlinuz`
    *   `/tmp/initrd.img`
    *   `/tmp/${MEGACLIVER}_MegaCLI_Linux/Linux MegaCLI ${MEGACLIVER}/MegaCli-${MEGACLIVER}-1.noarch.rpm`
    *   `/tmp/$package_name`
    *   `/tmp/sdpnetstat_1.60-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb`
    *   `/tmp/$(basename $SCR)`
    *   `/tmp/$2-$3.tmp`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker could leverage the race conditions to gain root privileges by manipulating temporary files used during provisioning or installation processes. This could include overwriting files such as kernel images, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
*   **Kernel Compromise:**  One specific impact mentioned is the ability for a local attacker to overwrite a kernel image used during node provisioning. This could allow the attacker to introduce malicious code into the kernel.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Chained Exploit):** When combined with a separate unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability, a remote attacker could also exploit the temporary file race conditions to compromise the kernel image provisioned by `eDeploy`.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:**  The vulnerabilities allow for overwriting of arbitrary files which can have various impacts including:
    *   Installing packages as root
    *   Modifying the kernel

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** A local attacker with access to the system where `eDeploy` is running can exploit the race conditions.
*   **Remote Access (Chained Exploit):**  A remote attacker, after gaining initial access via a separate remote code execution vulnerability, can use these race conditions to further compromise the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Attacker:** Requires local access to the system running `eDeploy`.
*   **Remote Attacker:** Requires the ability to exploit another vulnerability to gain initial remote access and then exploit the temp file race condition.
*   **Ability to Create Files/Manipulate `/tmp`:** An attacker would need the ability to create files in the `/tmp` directory, and to race other processes for access to the temp files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security.
*   The issue is tracked upstream in the eDeploy project: `<https://github.com/enovance/edeploy/issues/232>`.
*   Red Hat does not currently ship eNovance edeploy in a product form.
*   The issue was reported on 2014-10-14 and closed on 2015-03-17.
