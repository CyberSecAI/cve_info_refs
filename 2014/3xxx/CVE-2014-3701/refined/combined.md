| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1152548#c0)  David Jorm    2014-10-14 11:49:57 UTC  ``` Multiple tmp file race condition flaws were found in eDeploy. One of these flaws allowed a local attacker to overwrite a kernel image that would be used on nodes provisioned by eDeploy. In combination with an unauthenticated remote code execution exploit, a remote attacker could use this flaw to compromise the kernel image provisioned by eDeploy.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1152548#c1)  David Jorm    2014-10-14 11:50:37 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1152548#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2015-03-17 19:45:06 UTC  ``` Multiple tmp vulns, some leading to things like kernel modification, packages  being installed as root, etc. This means any local access == root access  trivially.  ./server/upload-health.py:$ curl -i -F name=test -F file=@/tmp/hw.lst <http://localhost/cgi-bin/upload.py> ./server/edeploy.conf:LOCKFILE=/tmp/edeploy.lock ./server/upload.py:$ curl -i -F name=test -F file=@/tmp/hw.lst <http://localhost/cgi-bin/upload.py> ./server/upload.py:    lock_filename = config_get('SERVER', 'LOCKFILE', '/tmp/edeploy.lock') ./tests/run_kvm.sh:LOCKFILE=/tmp/edeploy.lock ./docs/eDeployUserGuide.rst:   LOCKFILE = /tmp/edeploy.lock ./build/init.common:    [ -d /tmp ] || mkdir /tmp ./build/init:                        cp $d/boot/vmlinuz*$KVER* /tmp/vmlinuz || give_up "Kexec: Unable to copy kernel" ./build/init:                            cp $d/boot/initrd*$KVER* /tmp/initrd.img || give_up "Kexec: Unable to copy initrd" ./build/init:                            cp $d/boot/initramfs*$KVER* /tmp/initrd.img || give_up "Kexec: Unable to copy initrd" ./build/init:                            kexec -l /tmp/vmlinuz --initrd=/tmp/initrd.img --append="root=${root}${BOOT_ARG}" ./build/base.install:                chroot $target rpm -ivh "/tmp/${MEGACLIVER}_MegaCLI_Linux/Linux MegaCLI ${MEGACLIVER}/MegaCli-${MEGACLIVER}-1.noarch.rpm" ./build/base.install:        do_chroot $target dpkg -i /tmp/$package_name ./build/img.embedded:LOCKFILE=/tmp/edeploy.lock ./build/infiniband:    wget --no-verbose '<http://cs.stanford.edu/pub/mirrors/ubuntu/ubuntu/pool/universe/s/sdpnetstat/sdpnetstat_1.60-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb>' -O ${dir}/tmp/sdpnetstat_1.60-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb ./build/infiniband:    do_chroot $dir dpkg -i /tmp/sdpnetstat_1.60-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb ./build/infiniband:    do_chroot $dir rm /tmp/sdpnetstat_1.60-1ubuntu2_amd64.deb ./build/remote-install.sh:scp "$SCR" "$DST":/tmp/ ./build/remote-install.sh:ssh "$DST" bash /tmp/$(basename $SCR) ./build/img.install:BOOT_MOUNT_POINT=/tmp/$2-$3.tmp ./build/upgrade-from:/tmp/ ./src/health-client.py:    HP.start_log('/var/tmp/health-client.log', logging.DEBUG) ./src/health-server.py:    HP.start_log('/var/tmp/health-server.log', logging.DEBUG) ./tools/jenkins-build.sh:if [ -f /var/tmp/froze-builds ]; then ./tools/grapher/grapher:            epilog="Example: \ngrapher -g histogram -k cpu,logical,bandwidth_1G '/tmp/*.hw'")   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1152548#c4)  Kurt Seifried    2015-03-17 23:25:24 UTC  ``` This is now filed upstream <https://github.com/enovance/edeploy/issues/232>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1152548#c5)  Kurt Seifried    2015-03-19 04:16:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat does not currently ship eNovance edeploy in a product form and as such this issue has been filed upstream.   ``` |  |

  Description     : new way to provision/update systems

 eDeploy is a new way to provision/update systems (physical or virtual) using
 trees of files instead of packages or VM images.
 .
 Installation is done using these steps:
  * Detect PCI hardware and setup network.
  * Send the detected hardware config to the server.
  * The server sends back a configuration script.
  * Run the configuration script to setup IPMI, RAID, partitions and network.
  * According to the defined role, rsync the tree on the newly created
    partitions.
  * Configure the grub2 boot loader and reboot the system.
 .
 Then the system will boot on the provisioned harddrive directly.

```

thanks

Hi,

A long time ago, you expressed interest in packaging edeploy. Unfortunately,
it seems that it did not happen. In Debian, we try not to keep ITP bugs open
for a too long time, as it might cause other prospective maintainers to
refrain from packaging the software.

This is an automatic email to change the status of edeploy back from ITP
(Intent to Package) to RFP (Request for Package), because this bug hasn't seen
any activity during the last 12 months.

If you are still interested in packaging edeploy, please send a mail to
<control@bugs.debian.org> with:

 retitle 717664 ITP: edeploy -- new way to provision/update systems
 owner 717664 !
 thanks

It is also a good idea to document your progress on this ITP from time to
time, by mailing <717664@bugs.debian.org>.  If you need guidance on how to
package this software, please reply to this email, and/or contact the
debian-mentors@lists.debian.org mailing list.

Thank you for your interest in Debian,
--
Lucas, for the QA team <debian-qa@lists.debian.org>

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
