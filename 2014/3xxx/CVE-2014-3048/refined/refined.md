- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient restrictions on SSH users allowed unprivileged users to potentially invoke privileged commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the ability of a TSSC service user to gain unauthorized access to the attached TS7700 system via crafting specific SSH commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could grant a user full administrative access, enabling them to issue all administrative commands and potentially disrupt normal system operation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves using SSH to send crafted commands, requiring network access to the hardware.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the TS7700 hardware and must be a skilled user to craft the necessary SSH commands.
