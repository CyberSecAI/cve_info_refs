# Security Bulletin: IBM Virtualization Engine TS7700 â€“ Insufficient Restrictions on SSH Users (CVE-2014-3048)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Unprivileged users may be able to invoke privileged commands via SSH. With the right type of network access to the hardware, a skilled user could figure out a way to craft an SSH command to grant themselves privileged access, allowing the user to issue all administrative commands, with the potential to disrupt normal system operation. This patch fixes a security vulnerability that allows a TSSC service user unauthorized access to the attached TS7700.
