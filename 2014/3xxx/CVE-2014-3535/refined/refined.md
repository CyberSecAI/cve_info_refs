Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3535:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the Linux kernel's networking implementation, specifically within the `netdevice.h` file, during the processing of certain invalid packets received via a VxLAN interface. This occurs during logging operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer when handling logging for invalid VxLAN packets. This happens when a net\_device structure is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a kernel crash, causing a system-wide denial of service. The system becomes unusable and requires a reboot to recover.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted packets to a vulnerable system's VxLAN interface.
*   **VxLAN Interface:** The vulnerability is specific to the handling of network traffic on a VxLAN interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker must have the ability to send packets to a system with a configured and enabled VxLAN interface. This could be a user on the same network or a remote attacker capable of reaching the interface.
*   **Packet crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific type of invalid packet to trigger the NULL pointer dereference.

**Additional details:**

*   The fix involves changes in `netdevice.h` and `net/core/dev.c`. The logging macros are converted to functions using `struct va_format`, which allows format arguments to be verified before `printk` is called. Specifically, the patch addresses the case where the `dev` pointer can be NULL, causing a crash when trying to log the device name.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via the `RHSA-2014:1167` and `RHSA-2014:1168` errata.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 7, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 are not affected by this vulnerability.
