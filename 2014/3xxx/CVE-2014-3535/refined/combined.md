| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1114540#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2014-06-30 10:01:51 UTC  ``` Linux kernel built with the networking suppport(CONFIG_NET) is vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference flaw. It could occur while processing packets over VxLAN interface of a virtual network.  An unprivileged user/process could use this flaw to crash the system kernel resulting in DoS.  Upstream fix: -------------   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/256df2f3879efdb2e9808bdb1b54b16fbb11fa38>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1114540#c1)  Prasad Pandit    2014-06-30 10:40:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.  This issue affects the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1114540#c5)  Martin Prpič    2014-09-05 11:59:05 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's networking implementation handled logging while processing certain invalid packets coming in via a VxLAN interface. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system by sending a specially crafted packet to such an interface.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1114540#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-09-09 17:57:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:1167 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1167.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1114540#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-09-09 19:06:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    RHEV-H and Agents for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2014:1168 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1168.html>   ``` |  |
