Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the `/usr/lib/cgi-bin/download.py` script. The script constructs the file path to download by directly concatenating a user-supplied filename parameter with a base path, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is that the `download.py` script does not validate or sanitize the `filename` parameter received in the HTTP POST request. This allows an attacker to use relative path sequences (like `../`) to traverse outside the intended `/backup/` directory and access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The script lacks sufficient checks to ensure the provided filename is legitimate and within the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Download:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to download any file on the server that the webserver process has read access to. This could include sensitive information like configuration files, database files, password files, and even source code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `download.py` script.
- **Filename Parameter Manipulation:** The malicious input is supplied through the `filename` parameter within the POST request body. The attacker manipulates this parameter to include path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **HTTP Request Sending:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `download.py` script.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies within the following snippet of the `download.py` script:

```python
26     path = pyplate.getCMSRoot() + "/backup/" + filename
27     file = open (path, 'rb')
```

The script retrieves the CMS root path, appends `/backup/`, and then directly concatenates the `filename` parameter from the POST request, creating a path that is then used to open and serve the file. Since there's no sanitization of the `filename`, an attacker can insert `../../../../etc/passwd` to access and download the `/etc/passwd` file or any other file on the system.

**Example exploit:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

import requests
payload = {'filename': '../../../../etc/passwd'}
r = requests.post('[http://example.org/cgi-bin/download.py'](http://example.org/cgi-bin/download.py%27),
data=payload)
print r.text
```

This exploit sends a POST request with the malicious `filename` to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file.
