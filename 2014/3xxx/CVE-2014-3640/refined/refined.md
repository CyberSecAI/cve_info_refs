  "CVE-2014-3640": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way QEMU handled UDP packets with a source port and address of 0 when QEMU's user networking was in use. A local guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of UDP packets with a source port and source address of 0. Specifically, when QEMU's user networking is enabled, an uninitialized socket could be picked up when searching for matching UDP sockets. This uninitialized socket would then be passed to the `sosendto()` function, which dereferences a null pointer when accessing `so->slirp->vnetwork_mask.s_addr`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper handling of uninitialized data"
    ],
    "impact": "A local guest user can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the guest operating system.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious guest sends a crafted UDP packet with a source port and source address of 0.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user within the guest operating system is needed to send the crafted UDP packet."
