{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in shim when parsing IPv6 addresses provided by tftp:// DHCPv6 boot option.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Heap-based buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious server could supply a crafted IPv6 address that would cause shim to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code, allowing an attacker to bypass secure boot and gain control of the OS.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious server supplying a crafted IPv6 address during IPv6 network booting.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a malicious server on the network during the IPv6 network booting process."
