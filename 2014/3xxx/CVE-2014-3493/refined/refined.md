{
  "CVE-2014-3493": {
    "Root cause": "The smbd daemon did not properly handle certain files that used a valid Unicode character in their filename.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of Unicode path names.",
      "Incorrect use of error return value as a pointer in `push_ascii()` function leading to a crash or memory corruption."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote authenticated user could cause the `smbd` service to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending an authenticated non-Unicode request to read a file with a Unicode character in its name."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must be an authenticated user able to send requests to the `smbd` service. The request needs to be non-Unicode while attempting to access a file with a valid Unicode character."
  }
}
