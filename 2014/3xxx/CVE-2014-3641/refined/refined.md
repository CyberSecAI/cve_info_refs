      "content": "The GlusterFS Cinder driver uses \"qemu-img info\" to guess at whether a volume file is a raw image or a qcow2 image.\n\nThis is unsafe because if a user writes a qcow2 header into a volume, Cinder will interpret it as a qcow2-formatted image. It is believed this can lead to data being extracted from files on the Cinder volume host by writing a qcow2 header with a backing file pointer referencing a path to a file, and then cloning the volume.",
