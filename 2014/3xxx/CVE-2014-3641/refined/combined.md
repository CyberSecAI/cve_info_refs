## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-cinder security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1788)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix one security issue and multiple
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the
presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend
physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and
NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports
volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations.
Programatic management is available via Block Storage’s API.

A flaw was found in the GlusterFS and Linux smbfs drivers for OpenStack
Block Storage. A remote attacker could use this flaw to disclose an
arbitrary file from the cinder-volume host to a virtual instance by cloning
and attaching a volume with a malicious qcow2 header. (CVE-2014-3641)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard as the original
reporter.

The openstack-cinder packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1149739)

All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the cinder running services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

### Bug Description

Concern about this was raised by Duncan Thomas.

The GlusterFS Cinder driver uses "qemu-img info" to guess at whether a volume file is a raw image or a qcow2 image.

This is unsafe because if a user writes a qcow2 header into a volume, Cinder will interpret it as a qcow2-formatted image. It is believed this can lead to data being extracted from files on the Cinder volume host by writing a qcow2 header with a backing file pointer referencing a path to a file, and then cloning the volume. (Other similar paths may exist.)

To fix this, Cinder needs to track the file format of any file being processed this way and use "qemu-img convert -f <source\_format>" when performing operations like volume clone, which disables qemu-img's auto format detection.

This seems to affect the GlusterFS driver, but it is possible that other attack vectors exist. The convert\_image() method in cinder/image/image\_utils.py is used in assorted places and does not specify a source format, so other uses of it will need to be examined for safety.

Fixing this in the GlusterFS driver is not simple: since volume/snapshot qcow2 chains are manipulated by Nova as well as Cinder, we will need to have Nova pass information back to Cinder when an operation such as volume\_snapshot\_delete is performed, indicating the resulting format of any files modified.

Since the above is a large effort, it may be possible to mitigate this in the short-term by having Cinder enforce some rules about whether a backing file pointer is valid before performing an operation on the file. For the GlusterFS driver that would be: must start with 'volume-<x>' and not contain '/', since our valid usage of this only points to another file named volume-<id>.<id> and does not use paths.

This attack hasn't yet been demonstrated to work, but this is a commonly known problem when processing qcow2 files.

Another way to mitigate this in the short term may be to force volumes to be in qcow2 format. (glusterfs\_qcow2\_volumes option)

Forcing volumes to be qcow2 format always completely removes the issue - migration of old volumes is the issue there.

Validation of the backing chain can't just be by path / regex, as one avenue for attack is to use other tenant's volumes as backing files, which will have the correct path and name structure.

We can have backing chain validation insist that files start with the same volume & uuid filename, which should prevent access to anything outside of the correct data.

* [Possible intermediate fix (WIP)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/%2Bbug/1350504/%2Battachment/4186992/%2Bfiles/gluster_qcow2_lp1350504.patch)
  [Edit](/cinder/%2Bbug/1350504/%2Battachment/4186992)
  (7.0 KiB,
  text/plain)

This is a WIP patch which, I think, mitigates the security issue here. It disallows any operations on qcow2 files which have unexpected backing file pointers. If the backing file is not the expected format (based to the path the Gluster share is mounted to and the volume id ) then operations such as clone or delete snapshot will not be allowed.

I was able to reproduce this issue by:

 - Create a volume

 - Attach to VM

 - From within the guest, write qcow2 header to the volume pointing to /etc/passwd (arbitrary file) as the backing file

 - Detach volume

 - Clone volume

 - Attach the new volume: data from the host's /etc/passwd is seen.

This patch is likely not complete and not all of the changed paths have been tested, but I wanted to float this as an idea for an interim fix to get some feedback, since the proper fix will take some time. (The patch also still contains two LOG.errors which are just for testing and should be removed, and it needs unit tests.)

Note that this does not prevent a user from corrupting their own data by doing something like writing a qcow2 header that points to a different file in their qcow2 snapshot chain for that volume (which they do have access to). It should disallow data from any other Cinder volume or file on the c-vol host from being leaked.

(Also TODO: test w/ volume migration since it does strange things with changing volume IDs)

Here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Compute host data leak to vm instance with Cinder volume

Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP)

Products: Cinder

Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:

Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder GlusterFS driver. By overwriting a volume from within an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in Cinder leaking an arbitrary file from the compute host to the virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the libvirt/kvm context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver are affected.

Some questions:

Does the malicious volume allow write operation as well ?

Is the leaked through libvirt/kvm context ?

Should Eric Harney be added to the reporter list ?

Comments on Tristan's description:

I was focusing on Cinder-volume host data leak rather than compute host -- I'm not sure if a compute host leak is possible yet, but it might be. (Write the bad header, detach, reattach it w/o any other operations? I'll need to test this.)

The description paragraph there would result in leaking a file on the cinder-volume host, not the compute host.

We also need to note as a workaround that setting glusterfs\_qcow2\_volumes=True in cinder.conf prevents this issue for any volumes created after that option is set. (This is False by default.)

> Does the malicious volume allow write operation as well ?

I can't currently come up with a way that it would. This would be possible if you could inject a bad qcow2 header into a snapshot file, but since it's only possible for the base volume file, I can't think of any sequence of events that would allow this.

We only do two types of writes based on qcow2 backing file headers:

 1) commits of snapshot files down to the base volume file or another snapshot file

 2) pulls of base volume files up into a snapshot file.

> Is the leaked through libvirt/kvm context ?

Need to look at the above scenario about compute host leaks and get more info on this point.

The one I described was in the cinder-volume context, which in most deployments is running as a "cinder" user.

> Should Eric Harney be added to the reporter list ?

Probably not, Duncan pointed this out to me elsewhere, I just filed the bug to get things moving.

> From the VMT point of view, UUID guessing based attacks are not considered a practical vulnerability...

I don't think that even successful UUID guessing would buy you anything with the proposed patch. It restricts data access to the volume identified by the UUID which you already know and already have access to.

Revised patch (against master 69b4cfd).

Previous patch would break the smbfs driver because it used the wrong config option.

Thanks Eric!

The master patch is looking good, tests passed successfully.

Can you please submit backports for Icehouse and Havana too ?

Can you please change this in the Windows SMB driver as well? The only thing that needs to be done is updating the \_qemu\_img\_info method, adding the volume\_name parameter defaulting to None, so that this patch won't break it.

<https://github.com/openstack/cinder/blob/master/cinder/volume/drivers/windows/smbfs.py#L138>

The idea is that this driver does not use qemu-img actually (among others, it can not open in-use images on Windows, so it's using the Win32 API instead ATM) so the method is there for consistency.

Note that for the moment, only vhd/vhdx images are supported by this driver, so it is not exposed to the above mentioned security issue.

@Tristan Cacqueray Actually, there are two smbfs drivers. The one supposed to run on Windows is the one that's not affected by the bug, but will be affected by the fix. Without the change I've mentioned above (which is just about one LOC), the driver will be broken.

@Neutron-coresec : can you please review the patch submitted in #30. It still applies and pass unit-tests here.

We also need a stable/icehouse backport to progress on this bug (note that stable/havana is not necessary anymore). Some adjustments need to be done for smbfs.

Note that stable/havana is not required anymore as it reached EOL.

I think you meant @cinder-coresec there.

The fix in #30 looks good from a security point of view.

I think Petrut is correct in requiring his patch to be applied too to stop the windows driver being broken, though I can't test it.

The linux smb driver is affected, but is fixed by Eric's patch.

@Duncan oups, cinder-coresec indeed :)

Thank you for the review and the clarification on smbfs driver!

Here is the updated impact description:

Title: Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance

Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP)

Products: Cinder

Versions: up to 2014.1.2

Description:

Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder GlusterFS and Linux Smbfs driver. By overwriting a volume from within an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in affected drivers leaking an arbitrary file from the Cinder-volume host to the virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the Cinder context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver configured with glusterfs\_qcow2\_volumes=False (which is the default) or Cinder setups using Smbfs volume driver configured with smbfs\_default\_volume\_format=raw (which is not the default) are affected.

@Thierry

I have no objection to that, however I would like to land it ASAP and then figure out if we need to make changes to the Windows SMB driver as a result before final release. Honestly today vs Monday doesn't matter we can certainly take our chances but I just don't want it to sit much longer if we can help it.

Tristan:

That patch isn't part of the security fix proper. It is something we should land after the security patch goes in to prevent the Windows driver from breaking. It should be considered separate from this bug at this point.

@Tristan:

Here's a trace, showing up why that is required:

<http://paste.openstack.org/show/117171/>

The idea is that the methods from the base class will now pass one extra argument, namely volume\_name, and even if that method ignores it (because of the reasons I've mentioned earlier), it must accept it, otherwise that will raise the exception from the above trace.

As I've said, it's just a one liner but keeps the driver from breaking after this security fix is applied.

Windows SMBFS: Handle volume\_name in \_qemu\_img\_info

The volume\_name is now parsed to the \_qemu\_img\_info wrapper. As

    this method is not prone to security issues because this driver

    does not support raw images (at least not yet), we don't have to

    perform any checks on the backing image file path.

Thus, this method simply ignores this argument that will be parsed

    by the base class methods.

@Eric, @Duncan,

   Using qemu-img check <qcow2-file> might help here ?

I am hoping that qemu-img check should catch and fail the consistency check if the file was tampered with ?

Fix LVM iSCSI driver tgtadm CHAP authentication

Currently CHAP Authentication in LVM iSCSI driver with tgtadm does not work.

    This is because the tgtadm helper creates the target configuration file

    with an 'IncomingUser' entry, which is ignored by tgtd.

    This patch fixes it to 'incominguser'.

Export cinder volumes only if the status is 'in-use'

Currently, cinder volumes are exported both 'in-use' and 'available'

    after restarting cinder-volume service.

    This behavior was introduced following commit.

commit ffefe18334a9456250e1b6ff88b7b47fb366f374

      Author: Zhiteng Huang <email address hidden>

      Date: Sat Aug 23 18:32:57 2014 +0000

If the volumes are attached to nova instances, they should be exported

    via tgtd after restarting cinder-volume.

    But the volumes which are not attached to instances must not be exported

    because everyone can connect these volumes.

This patch changes volume export behavior that exports a volume only if

    the volume status is 'in-use'.

Fix LVM iSCSI driver tgtadm CHAP authentication
Currently CHAP Authentication in LVM iSCSI driver with tgtadm does not work.
This is because the tgtadm helper creates the target configuration file
with an 'IncomingUser' entry, which is ignored by tgtd.
This patch fixes it to 'incominguser'.

Export cinder volumes only if the status is 'in-use'
Currently, cinder volumes are exported both 'in-use' and 'available'
after restarting cinder-volume service.
This behavior was introduced following commit.

If the volumes are attached to nova instances, they should be exported
via tgtd after restarting cinder-volume.
But the volumes which are not attached to instances must not be exported
because everyone can connect these volumes.
This patch changes volume export behavior that exports a volume only if
the volume status is 'in-use'.

Make sure device support Direct before setting
We added '-t none' option to the qemu-img convert operation
in image\_utils.py a while back to accomodate a couple of
backend devices that didn't flush writes on disconnect.
(Change: I7a04f683add8c23b9125fe837c4048ccc3ac224d)
The only problem here is that some backend devices don't
support Direct mode and raise an exception and fail when
setting this option.
This patch adds a simple check using dd to see if the dest
supports the Direct flag and only sets '-t none' if the device
does in fact support it.
Additionally it was brought up that even yet other backends
are using file devices not blk devices. In their case setting
Direct will still work, however it's sub-optimal as qemu-convert
has internal mechanisms to make sure flushing etc are done
correctly and efficiently for those devices. So to accomodate
that particular use case I'm also adding a check if blk dev
that can be used for determining whether to set Direct for the
qemu-convert process.

ZFSSA iSCSI vol create fails with vol type option
Vol create with volume-type option is not working since
volume\_backend\_name contains the class name as
predefined string. No matter what was specified in cinder.conf
as volume\_backend\_name, volume creation failed.
Multi-backend option and using extra specs to create custom volumes
won't work.
The fix is to look whether volume\_backend\_name is part of the
configuration or falls into the class name in case there is
no backend name.

Handle eqlx SSH connection close on abort.
EqualLogic array CLI operation timeout causes the
SSH thread to be aborted. This would cause SSH
sessions to be orphaned and hit a max connection
limit on the array. This fix catches these aborts

Fix race condition in ISCSIConnector \_disconnect\_volume\_multipath\_iscsi
This is a similar issue as seen in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1375382
The list of devices returned by driver.get\_all\_block\_devices() in
\_disconnect\_volume\_multipath\_iscsi will potentially contain broken
symlinks as the SCSI devices have been deleted from calling
self.\_linuxscsi.remove\_multipath\_device(device\_realpath) right before
\_disconnect\_volume\_multipath\_iscsi but the udev rule for the symlink
may not yet have completed.
Adding in a check to os.path.exists() will ensure that we will not
consider the broken symlinks as an “in use” device.

Deprecate / obsolete NetApp volume extra specs
The NetApp Data ONTAP (Cluster-mode) NFS & iSCSI drivers for Juno support
the Cinder pools feature, but the drivers are reporting two qualified
extra specs that must be converted to unqualified extra specs in order to
be used by the Cinder scheduler's capability filter. Furthermore, there
are four extra specs that must be deprecated due to having the pools
feature. Warnings will be logged during volume creation if any of the
obsolete or deprecated extra specs are seen in the volume type.

IBM Storwize driver: Retype the volume with correct empty QoS
\* Currently for Storwzie driver, if the new type does not have QoS
configurations, the old QoS configurations remain in the volume after
retyping it. It should be retyped into a volume with empty QoS for the
Storwize driver.
\* Refactor three dicts into one for better maintainance of the QoS keys
for Storwize driver.

Windows SMBFS: Handle volume\_name in \_qemu\_img\_info
The volume\_name is now parsed to the \_qemu\_img\_info wrapper. As
this method is not prone to security issues because this driver
does not support raw images (at least not yet), we don't have to
perform any checks on the backing image file path.
Thus, this method simply ignores this argument that will be parsed
by the base class methods.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-cinder security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1787)

## Topic

Updated openstack-cinder packages that fix one security issue and multiple
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Block Storage (cinder) manages block storage mounting and the
presentation of such mounted block storage to instances. The backend
physical storage can consist of local disks, or Fiber Channel, iSCSI, and
NFS mounts attached to Compute nodes. In addition, Block Storage supports
volume backups, and snapshots for temporary save and restore operations.
Programatic management is available via Block Storage’s API.

A flaw was found in the GlusterFS and Linux smbfs drivers for OpenStack
Block Storage. A remote attacker could use this flaw to disclose an
arbitrary file from the cinder-volume host to a virtual instance by cloning
and attaching a volume with a malicious qcow2 header. (CVE-2014-3641)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard as the original
reporter.

The openstack-cinder packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1149750)

All users of openstack-cinder are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the cinder running services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# USN-2405-1: OpenStack Cinder vulnerabilities

11 November 2014

OpenStack Cinder could be made to expose sensitive information over the
network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [cinder](/security/cves?package=cinder) - OpenStack storage service

## Details

Duncan Thomas discovered that OpenStack Cinder did not properly track the

file format when using the GlusterFS of Smbfs drivers. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this to potentially obtain file contents

from the compute host. ([CVE-2014-3641](/security/CVE-2014-3641))

Amrith Kumar discovered that OpenStack Cinder did not properly sanitize log

message contents. Under certain circumstances, a local attacker with read

access to Cinder log files could obtain access to sensitive information.

([CVE-2014-7230](/security/CVE-2014-7230))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [python-cinder](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cinder)
  -
  [1:2014.1.3-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/cinder/1%3A2014.1.3-0ubuntu1.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# [OSSA 2014-033] GlusterFS driver uses unsafe qcow2 format detection (CVE-2014-3641)

### Bug Description

Concern about this was raised by Duncan Thomas.

The GlusterFS Cinder driver uses "qemu-img info" to guess at whether a volume file is a raw image or a qcow2 image.

This is unsafe because if a user writes a qcow2 header into a volume, Cinder will interpret it as a qcow2-formatted image. It is believed this can lead to data being extracted from files on the Cinder volume host by writing a qcow2 header with a backing file pointer referencing a path to a file, and then cloning the volume. (Other similar paths may exist.)

To fix this, Cinder needs to track the file format of any file being processed this way and use "qemu-img convert -f <source\_format>" when performing operations like volume clone, which disables qemu-img's auto format detection.

This seems to affect the GlusterFS driver, but it is possible that other attack vectors exist. The convert\_image() method in cinder/image/image\_utils.py is used in assorted places and does not specify a source format, so other uses of it will need to be examined for safety.

Fixing this in the GlusterFS driver is not simple: since volume/snapshot qcow2 chains are manipulated by Nova as well as Cinder, we will need to have Nova pass information back to Cinder when an operation such as volume\_snapshot\_delete is performed, indicating the resulting format of any files modified.

Since the above is a large effort, it may be possible to mitigate this in the short-term by having Cinder enforce some rules about whether a backing file pointer is valid before performing an operation on the file. For the GlusterFS driver that would be: must start with 'volume-<x>' and not contain '/', since our valid usage of this only points to another file named volume-<id>.<id> and does not use paths.

This attack hasn't yet been demonstrated to work, but this is a commonly known problem when processing qcow2 files.

Another way to mitigate this in the short term may be to force volumes to be in qcow2 format. (glusterfs\_qcow2\_volumes option)

Forcing volumes to be qcow2 format always completely removes the issue - migration of old volumes is the issue there.

Validation of the backing chain can't just be by path / regex, as one avenue for attack is to use other tenant's volumes as backing files, which will have the correct path and name structure.

We can have backing chain validation insist that files start with the same volume & uuid filename, which should prevent access to anything outside of the correct data.

* [Possible intermediate fix (WIP)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/%2Bbug/1350504/%2Battachment/4186992/%2Bfiles/gluster_qcow2_lp1350504.patch)
  [Edit](/cinder/%2Bbug/1350504/%2Battachment/4186992)
  (7.0 KiB,
  text/plain)

This is a WIP patch which, I think, mitigates the security issue here. It disallows any operations on qcow2 files which have unexpected backing file pointers. If the backing file is not the expected format (based to the path the Gluster share is mounted to and the volume id ) then operations such as clone or delete snapshot will not be allowed.

I was able to reproduce this issue by:

 - Create a volume

 - Attach to VM

 - From within the guest, write qcow2 header to the volume pointing to /etc/passwd (arbitrary file) as the backing file

 - Detach volume

 - Clone volume

 - Attach the new volume: data from the host's /etc/passwd is seen.

This patch is likely not complete and not all of the changed paths have been tested, but I wanted to float this as an idea for an interim fix to get some feedback, since the proper fix will take some time. (The patch also still contains two LOG.errors which are just for testing and should be removed, and it needs unit tests.)

Note that this does not prevent a user from corrupting their own data by doing something like writing a qcow2 header that points to a different file in their qcow2 snapshot chain for that volume (which they do have access to). It should disallow data from any other Cinder volume or file on the c-vol host from being leaked.

(Also TODO: test w/ volume migration since it does strange things with changing volume IDs)

Thanks for providing a patch!

I have nominated icehouse and havana series because the affected code is also present in those release.

Can you confirm those versions are also impacted ?

I think the full fix needs to do more than the attached draft path, since that seems to still allow me to access other tenant's volumes if I know the uuid of the volume (I'm only looking at the code, I haven't proven it)

Here is impact description draft #1:

Title: Compute host data leak to vm instance with Cinder volume

Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP)

Products: Cinder

Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:

Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder GlusterFS driver. By overwriting a volume from within an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in Cinder leaking an arbitrary file from the compute host to the virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the libvirt/kvm context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver are affected.

Some questions:

Does the malicious volume allow write operation as well ?

Is the leaked through libvirt/kvm context ?

Should Eric Harney be added to the reporter list ?

Comments on Tristan's description:

I was focusing on Cinder-volume host data leak rather than compute host -- I'm not sure if a compute host leak is possible yet, but it might be. (Write the bad header, detach, reattach it w/o any other operations? I'll need to test this.)

The description paragraph there would result in leaking a file on the cinder-volume host, not the compute host.

We also need to note as a workaround that setting glusterfs\_qcow2\_volumes=True in cinder.conf prevents this issue for any volumes created after that option is set. (This is False by default.)

> Does the malicious volume allow write operation as well ?

I can't currently come up with a way that it would. This would be possible if you could inject a bad qcow2 header into a snapshot file, but since it's only possible for the base volume file, I can't think of any sequence of events that would allow this.

We only do two types of writes based on qcow2 backing file headers:

 1) commits of snapshot files down to the base volume file or another snapshot file

 2) pulls of base volume files up into a snapshot file.

> Is the leaked through libvirt/kvm context ?

Need to look at the above scenario about compute host leaks and get more info on this point.

The one I described was in the cinder-volume context, which in most deployments is running as a "cinder" user.

> Should Eric Harney be added to the reporter list ?

Probably not, Duncan pointed this out to me elsewhere, I just filed the bug to get things moving.

> From the VMT point of view, UUID guessing based attacks are not considered a practical vulnerability...

I don't think that even successful UUID guessing would buy you anything with the proposed patch. It restricts data access to the volume identified by the UUID which you already know and already have access to.

> From the VMT point of view, UUID guessing based attacks are not considered a practical vulnerability...
I don't think that even successful UUID guessing would buy you anything with the proposed patch. It restricts data access to the volume identified by the UUID which you already know and already have access to.

Thanks for the additional details!

Here is impact description draft #2:

Title: Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance

Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP)

Products: Cinder

Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:

Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder GlusterFS driver. By overwriting a volume from within an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in GlusterFS driver leaking an arbitrary file from the Cinder-volume host to the virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the Cinder context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver configured with glusterfs\_qcow2\_volumes=False (which is the default) are affected.

@glance-coresec/@eric: if the master patch looks good to you, any chance you also provide backports for stables in order for VMT to proceed to CVE request ?

This patch needs more work. It fails snapshot-delete operations on a migrated GlusterFS volume because it only checks id and not name\_id.

Update to current master (52cc2f) and protect the smbfs driver as well.

The smbfs driver is currently not vulnerable in the default configuration (using qcow2 by default to avoid this), but raw format can be enabled, which exposes this issue.

I don't have a configuration to test the smbfs changes.

Can you please change this in the Windows SMB driver as well? The only thing that needs to be done is updating the \_qemu\_img\_info method, adding the volume\_name parameter defaulting to None, so that this patch won't break it.

<https://github.com/openstack/cinder/blob/master/cinder/volume/drivers/windows/smbfs.py#L138>

The idea is that this driver does not use qemu-img actually (among others, it can not open in-use images on Windows, so it's using the Win32 API instead ATM) so the method is there for consistency.

Note that for the moment, only vhd/vhdx images are supported by this driver, so it is not exposed to the above mentioned security issue.

@Tristan Cacqueray Actually, there are two smbfs drivers. The one supposed to run on Windows is the one that's not affected by the bug, but will be affected by the fix. Without the change I've mentioned above (which is just about one LOC), the driver will be broken.

We also need a stable/icehouse backport to progress on this bug (note that stable/havana is not necessary anymore). Some adjustments need to be done for smbfs.

Note that stable/havana is not required anymore as it reached EOL.

I think you meant @cinder-coresec there.

The fix in #30 looks good from a security point of view.

I think Petrut is correct in requiring his patch to be applied too to stop the windows driver being broken, though I can't test it.

The linux smb driver is affected, but is fixed by Eric's patch.

Thank you for the review and the clarification on smbfs driver!

Here is the updated impact description:

Title: Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance

Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP)

Products: Cinder

Versions: up to 2014.1.2

Description:

Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder GlusterFS and Linux Smbfs driver. By overwriting a volume from within an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in affected drivers leaking an arbitrary file from the Cinder-volume host to the virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the Cinder context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver configured with glusterfs\_qcow2\_volumes=False (which is the default) or Cinder setups using Smbfs volume driver configured with smbfs\_default\_volume\_format=raw (which is not the default) are affected.

@Thierry

I have no objection to that, however I would like to land it ASAP and then figure out if we need to make changes to the Windows SMB driver as a result before final release. Honestly today vs Monday doesn't matter we can certainly take our chances but I just don't want it to sit much longer if we can help it.

Sure, definitely land it in RC1 if you can ! The issue being, this issue being embargoed we'll need to give some advance notice, so RC1 would be artificially delayed by ~ 5 days... so I'd prefer we don't block on it.

I've attached the one liner patch that needs to be applied so that the previous patch does not break the Windows SMBFS driver.

I've tested the SMBFS drivers with the 2 patches applied having no issues.

Can someone confirm "Windows-SMBFS-Handle-volume\_name-in-\_qemu\_img\_info.patch" is really effective ?

Applied on master after "Refuse-invalid-qcow2-backing-files-rev3\_master\_69b4cfd.patch" it only adds "volume\_name=None" parameter to \_qemu\_img\_info() that seems unused (either by caller or in the function body)...

Tristan:

That patch isn't part of the security fix proper. It is something we should land after the security patch goes in to prevent the Windows driver from breaking. It should be considered separate from this bug at this point.

(Note: I've looked at this issue a bit previously but haven't analyzed Petrut's patch in detail.)

@Tristan:

Here's a trace, showing up why that is required:

<http://paste.openstack.org/show/117171/>

The idea is that the methods from the base class will now pass one extra argument, namely volume\_name, and even if that method ignores it (because of the reasons I've mentioned earlier), it must accept it, otherwise that will raise the exception from the above trace.

As I've said, it's just a one liner but keeps the driver from breaking after this security fix is applied.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm amending this last fix to the pre-OSSA as stakeholder might be impacted by this error after applying the security patch.

Windows SMBFS: Handle volume\_name in \_qemu\_img\_info

The volume\_name is now parsed to the \_qemu\_img\_info wrapper. As

    this method is not prone to security issues because this driver

    does not support raw images (at least not yet), we don't have to

    perform any checks on the backing image file path.

Thus, this method simply ignores this argument that will be parsed

    by the base class methods.

Windows SMBFS: Handle volume\_name in \_qemu\_img\_info
The volume\_name is now parsed to the \_qemu\_img\_info wrapper. As
this method is not prone to security issues because this driver
does not support raw images (at least not yet), we don't have to
perform any checks on the backing image file path.
Thus, this method simply ignores this argument that will be parsed
by the base class methods.

@Eric, @Duncan,

   Using qemu-img check <qcow2-file> might help here ?

I am hoping that qemu-img check should catch and fail the consistency check if the file was tampered with ?

Fix LVM iSCSI driver tgtadm CHAP authentication

Currently CHAP Authentication in LVM iSCSI driver with tgtadm does not work.

    This is because the tgtadm helper creates the target configuration file

    with an 'IncomingUser' entry, which is ignored by tgtd.

    This patch fixes it to 'incominguser'.

Make sure device support Direct before setting
We added '-t none' option to the qemu-img convert operation
in image\_utils.py a while back to accomodate a couple of
backend devices that didn't flush writes on disconnect.
(Change: I7a04f683add8c23b9125fe837c4048ccc3ac224d)
The only problem here is that some backend devices don't
support Direct mode and raise an exception and fail when
setting this option.
This patch adds a simple check using dd to see if the dest
supports the Direct flag and only sets '-t none' if the device
does in fact support it.
Additionally it was brought up that even yet other backends
are using file devices not blk devices. In their case setting
Direct will still work, however it's sub-optimal as qemu-convert
has internal mechanisms to make sure flushing etc are done
correctly and efficiently for those devices. So to accomodate
that particular use case I'm also adding a check if blk dev
that can be used for determining whether to set Direct for the
qemu-convert process.

ZFSSA iSCSI vol create fails with vol type option
Vol create with volume-type option is not working since
volume\_backend\_name contains the class name as
predefined string. No matter what was specified in cinder.conf
as volume\_backend\_name, volume creation failed.
Multi-backend option and using extra specs to create custom volumes
won't work.
The fix is to look whether volume\_backend\_name is part of the
configuration or falls into the class name in case there is
no backend name.

Fix race condition in ISCSIConnector \_disconnect\_volume\_multipath\_iscsi
This is a similar issue as seen in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/cinder/+bug/1375382
The list of devices returned by driver.get\_all\_block\_devices() in
\_disconnect\_volume\_multipath\_iscsi will potentially contain broken
symlinks as the SCSI devices have been deleted from calling
self.\_linuxscsi.remove\_multipath\_device(device\_realpath) right before
\_disconnect\_volume\_multipath\_iscsi but the udev rule for the symlink
may not yet have completed.
Adding in a check to os.path.exists() will ensure that we will not
consider the broken symlinks as an “in use” device.

Deprecate / obsolete NetApp volume extra specs
The NetApp Data ONTAP (Cluster-mode) NFS & iSCSI drivers for Juno support
the Cinder pools feature, but the drivers are reporting two qualified
extra specs that must be converted to unqualified extra specs in order to
be used by the Cinder scheduler's capability filter. Furthermore, there
are four extra specs that must be deprecated due to having the pools
feature. Warnings will be logged during volume creation if any of the
obsolete or deprecated extra specs are seen in the volume type.

Windows SMBFS: Handle volume\_name in \_qemu\_img\_info
The volume\_name is now parsed to the \_qemu\_img\_info wrapper. As
this method is not prone to security issues because this driver
does not support raw images (at least not yet), we don't have to
perform any checks on the backing image file path.
Thus, this method simply ignores this argument that will be parsed
by the base class methods.

# [OSSA 2014-033] Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance (CVE-2014-3641)

---

*From*: Tristan Cacqueray <tristan.cacqueray () enovance com>

*Date*: Thu, 02 Oct 2014 19:09:42 -0400

```
OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-033
CVE: CVE-2014-3641
Date: October 02, 2014
Title: Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance
Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP)
Products: Cinder
Versions: up to 2014.1.2

Description:
Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder
GlusterFS and Linux Smbfs drivers. By overwriting a volume from within
an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be
able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in affected
drivers leaking an arbitrary file from the Cinder-volume host to the
virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the Cinder
context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver
configured with glusterfs_qcow2_volumes=False (which is the default) or
Cinder setups using Smbfs volume driver configured with
smbfs_default_volume_format=raw (which is not the default) are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/125671>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/125710>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno release 2014.2 and in
the upcoming 2014.1.3 release.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1141996#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-16 01:02:48 UTC  ``` The OpenStack project reports:  "" Title: Cinder-volume host data leak to vm instance Reporter: Duncan Thomas (HP) Products: Cinder Versions: up to 2014.1.2  Description: Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard reported a vulnerability in Cinder GlusterFS and Linux Smbfs driver. By overwriting a volume from within an instance with a malicious qcow2 header, an authenticated user may be able to clone and attach that corrupted volume resulting in affected drivers leaking an arbitrary file from the Cinder-volume host to the virtual instance. Note that the host file must be readable by the Cinder context to be exposed. Only Cinder setups using GlusterFS volume driver configured with glusterfs_qcow2_volumes=False (which is the default) or Cinder setups using Smbfs volume driver configured with smbfs_default_volume_format=raw (which is not the default) are affected. ""  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Duncan Thomas from Hewlett Packard as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1141996#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-01 05:32:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 942918](attachment.cgi?id=942918&action=diff "upstream patch for juno") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=942918&action=edit "upstream patch for juno") upstream patch for juno   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1141996#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-01 05:32:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 942919](attachment.cgi?id=942919&action=diff "upstream patch for icehouse") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=942919&action=edit "upstream patch for icehouse") upstream patch for icehouse   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1141996#c4)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-01 05:33:17 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 942920](attachment.cgi?id=942920&action=diff "upstream patch to fix an issue (caused by the previously attached patch) in the Windows Smbfs volume driver") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=942920&action=edit "upstream patch to fix an issue (caused by the previously attached patch) in the Windows Smbfs volume driver") upstream patch to fix an issue (caused by the previously attached patch) in the Windows Smbfs volume driver   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1141996#c7)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-03 03:10:19 UTC  ``` This issue is public now:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/78>  <https://review.openstack.org/125671> <https://review.openstack.org/125710>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1141996#c9)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-03 03:13:11 UTC  ```  Created openstack-cinder tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1149051](show_bug.cgi?id=1149051 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3641 openstack-cinder: Cinder-volume host data leak to virtual machine instance [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1141996#c11)  Fedora Update System    2014-11-01 16:52:01 UTC  ``` openstack-cinder-2014.1.3-1.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
