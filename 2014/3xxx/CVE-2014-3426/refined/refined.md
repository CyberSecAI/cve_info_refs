Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-3426:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Mosaic version 2.1 uses the temporary file `/tmp/Mosaic.pid`. It uses a predictable file name based on the process ID (PID), creating a potential race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Temporary File Name:** The usage of `/tmp/Mosaic.pid` makes the temporary file name predictable.
*   **Race Condition:**  A local attacker can create the file `/tmp/Mosaic.pid` with a specific PID and potentially cause a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By creating the `/tmp/Mosaic.pid` file for every possible PID, a local user can cause a "remote control" outage in Mosaic. This prevents Mosaic from properly communicating with its control processes because it cannot create or write to its intended file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system running Mosaic.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker creates the targeted temporary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system where Mosaic is running.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker must have write access to the `/tmp` directory to create the specifically named files.

**Additional Notes:**

* This CVE is specific to Mosaic 2.1's predictable use of the `/tmp/Mosaic.pid` file. Mosaic 2.0, assigned CVE-2014-3425, used `/tmp/xmosaic.pid`, having similar weaknesses.
*   The vulnerability allows for a denial of service by preventing Mosaic's remote control functionality.
* The Openwall content highlights the reasoning behind assigning separate CVE IDs to Emacs and Mosaic, as the issue existed within Mosaic itself.
* Emacs also had a similar issue with /tmp files which were assigned other CVEs, but this CVE focuses solely on Mosaic.
