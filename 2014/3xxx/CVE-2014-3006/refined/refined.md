Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is that the installer servlet (`/ies/install`) for Sitepark Information Enterprise Server (IES) was not disabled after an update from previous versions to versions 2.9 until 2.9.6. This left the installer accessible to unauthenticated users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the `/ies/install` servlet to unauthenticated users.
*   **Insecure Installer:** The installer form was not disabled after the update.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** There was a failure to implement proper access controls on the installer servlet, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Password Reset:** An attacker can reset the password for the "manager" account, gaining full administrative access.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information about the IES installation, such as the license key and directory names, can be obtained.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By gaining administrative access, attackers can potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Access:** The attack vector is through direct HTTP access to the vulnerable servlet at `/ies/install/`.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker only requires network connectivity to the vulnerable IES server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable IES server via the network.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication or credentials are required. The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
