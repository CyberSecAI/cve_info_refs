- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when adding a project, specifically in the `desc` parameter. The unsanitized input is then reflected back into the HTML document, leading to a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's response, allowing them to perform actions such as:
    - Steal user cookies and session tokens
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the application
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim user
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the `desc` parameter of the "add project" form, located at `admin.php?action=addpro`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
    - The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests. This can be achieved through a proxy tool.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
