- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Unix file parameter alteration issue within the GDS component of IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system is vulnerable to unauthorized access, allowing an authorized user to copy files from the InfoSphere MDM - Collaborative Edition system. This indicates a weakness in file access controls or parameter validation within the GDS component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to data by copying files from the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the Unix file parameter alteration vulnerability, presumably through a mechanism within the GDS component that handles file operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authorized user within the system to exploit the vulnerability, indicating that the vulnerability arises from an issue with permission control within the application logic.
