Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the "Calculated" question type of the Moodle quiz module. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary code into the formulas used by these questions, leading to server-side execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a critical security flaw, granting attackers significant control over the system.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue lies in the lack of proper validation or sanitization of the formulas used in calculated questions. This allows malicious code to pass through and be processed by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the Moodle server.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could access sensitive data stored in the Moodle database.
- **Malware Distribution:** The server could be used to distribute malware to users.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers could also use this to disrupt or disable the Moodle server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Calculated" question type within the Moodle quiz module.
- An attacker would inject malicious code within a formula field of a "Calculated" question.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Moodle Account:**  An attacker would need a Moodle account with permissions to create or edit quizzes containing calculated questions.
- **Knowledge of Moodle Question Types:**  The attacker needs knowledge of how the "Calculated" question type works to inject the malicious code in the correct manner.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability is considered "Serious" and affects multiple versions of Moodle (2.7, 2.6 to 2.6.3, 2.5 to 2.5.6, 2.4 to 2.4.10, and earlier unsupported versions).
- Fixed versions are 2.7.1, 2.6.4, 2.5.7, and 2.4.11.
- A workaround is available which consists of disabling the "calculated question type."
- The vulnerability was reported by Frédéric Massart.
- The commit details for the fix are available at: <http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-46148>
