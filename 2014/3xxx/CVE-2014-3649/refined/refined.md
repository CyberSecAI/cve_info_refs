```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The password field on the login page of JBoss AeroGear accepts and renders HTML content. When two-factor authentication is enabled, the password field is reflected back to the user when prompted for a one-time password, without proper sanitization, leading to the possibility of reflected XSS.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the password field. When a user with two-factor authentication enabled submits a crafted password, the malicious payload is reflected back to the user and executed in their browser. This can allow the attacker to gain control of the victim's session, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data compromise.
- Attack vectors: An attacker can craft a malicious link or page, tricking a logged-in user into submitting a login request with the malicious payload embedded in the password field.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to submit a crafted login request, typically through social engineering or by exploiting another vulnerability that allows them to control a page visited by the victim. The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have any specific privileges, but the victim must be logged into the affected application for the attack to succeed.
