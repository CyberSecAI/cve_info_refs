Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3966:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the fact that MediaWiki parsed usernames as wikitext on the `Special:PasswordReset` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** When `$wgRawHtml` was enabled on a wiki, the parsing of usernames as wikitext allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. This was because the username field on the password reset page was not properly sanitized, leading to the execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An unauthenticated attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the username field, which would then be executed when a user viewed the password reset page. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Privilege escalation:** In the specific scenario where a wiki has `$wgRawHtml` enabled and restricts editing to prevent JavaScript injection, this vulnerability bypasses those restrictions. Because the `Special:PasswordReset` page is often whitelisted (accessible to all), it allows an attacker to execute JavaScript even on private wikis where they might not have the permission to do so otherwise.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `Special:PasswordReset` page. The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a crafted username through this page, which contains malicious wikitext, leading to XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted username through the `Special:PasswordReset` page.
- The target wiki needs to have `$wgRawHtml` enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was initially reported by Omer Iqbal.
- The vulnerability was addressed by escaping the username with `wfEscapeWikiText` on the `Special:PasswordReset` page.
- The vulnerability was patched in MediaWiki versions 1.19.16, 1.21.10, and 1.22.7.
- While `Special:PasswordReset` page is whitelisted by default on private wikis, this threat was considered very low as the default XFO rules prevent this special page from being used in an iframe, which is a common way to execute such attacks.
