- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Local Access Only" authentication type for the Help Server Administration in IBM Rational ClearQuest does not prevent unauthenticated remote access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, specifically the failure of the "Local Access Only" setting to restrict access to the Help Server Administration. This allows unauthenticated remote access to the administration interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Help Server Administration interface.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the Help Server Administration interface remotely over the network. No authentication is required due to the vulnerability.
