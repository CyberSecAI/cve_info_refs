The provided content includes information about CVE-2014-3503.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of insecure random number generation implementations for password creation within Apache Syncope.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Insecure Random implementations were used to generate passwords when a user had no existing password under specific circumstances. This makes generated passwords predictable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially guess a generated password due to the predictable nature of the random numbers used in password creation. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves attempting to guess passwords generated by the insecure random number implementations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any specific privileges within the application, but needs to be aware that the targeted user will have a password generated. The attacker needs to be able to guess the password based on the insecure random number generation.

**Additional notes:**
The vulnerability affects releases 1.1.0 to 1.1.7 and was fixed in release 1.1.8 via revision [1596537](http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1596537).
