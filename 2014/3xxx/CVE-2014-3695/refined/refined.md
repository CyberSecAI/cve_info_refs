    "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the Pidgin MXit plugin's improper handling of malformed emoticons, specifically related to the size or length of the emoticon data. The vulnerability lies in how the application parses incoming emoticon data and subsequently handles memory allocation based on the provided length, without proper validation of the size before memory operations, leading to a potential crash.",
