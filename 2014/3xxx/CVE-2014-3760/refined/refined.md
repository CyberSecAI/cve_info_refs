The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in the D-Link DAP 1150 router, specifically firmware version 1.2.94. These vulnerabilities include CSRF, Abuse of Functionality (AoF), and XSS.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input validation and security measures in the web interface of the D-Link DAP 1150 router, specifically in how it handles requests to modify router settings via the `index.cgi` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The router's web interface doesn't implement proper CSRF protection. This allows an attacker to craft malicious URLs that, when visited by an authenticated user, can change the router's DMZ or URL filter settings.
    *   Specifically, the requests lack anti-CSRF tokens.

*   **Abuse of Functionality (AoF):** The URL filter functionality, meant to control access to certain websites, can be abused to block users of the router from accessing specific sites by setting `enable` parameter to `DROP`. This occurs because the application logic allows for the manipulation of the filter rules.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when configuring URL filters, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability where JavaScript code can be injected into the URL filter settings and will execute in the context of other users who view that page.
    *   The `url` parameter within the `res_buf` can be used to inject `<script>` tags which then get executed within the router's web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** Attackers can remotely enable/disable DMZ, add, edit, or delete URL filters. This can lead to unauthorized changes in network configurations.
*   **AoF:**  Attackers can block access to specific websites for router users, effectively denying service.
*  **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that can be executed in the context of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or further malicious actions within the router's administration panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSRF & AoF:** These attacks are carried out by crafting malicious URLs and tricking an authenticated user into visiting those URLs. This can be achieved through a malicious link embedded on a web page or via other means of social engineering.
*   **XSS:** This attack is executed by injecting a malicious JavaScript payload via the vulnerable `res_buf` parameter in the URL filter's settings. The payload is then stored and executed when an administrator views the relevant configuration page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious site to exploit CSRF and AoF vulnerabilities. The attacker does not need to have direct access to the router's configuration page.
*   For XSS the attacker needs to be able to send the malicious URL to the router by some method in order to inject the script. This would typically involve tricking a user into visiting the URL, as described above for CSRF, or similar methods.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim but would need to use a method to trick an administrator to access a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered in 2011 but remained unpatched as D-Link ignored the vulnerability reports, despite previous vulnerability disclosures on the same product.
*   The researcher explicitly states that the described vulnerabilities are in router mode, distinguishing it from previous reports in access point mode.
* The full details are provided as well as PoC URLs for each described vulnerability, making it easy to reproduce and verify these issues.
