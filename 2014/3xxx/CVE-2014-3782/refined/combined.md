# Dotclear <= 2.6.2 (Media Manager) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability

#### â¢ Software Link:

<http://dotclear.org>

#### â¢ Affected Versions:

Version 2.6.2 and probably prior versions.

#### â¢ Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerability exists because of the `filemanager::isFileExclude()` method not properly verifying the extension of uploaded files. This method just checks whether the uploaded file name matches the **“exclude\_pattern”** regular expression, which by default is set to `/\.php$/i`. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a file with multiple extensions or other extensions (like .php5 or .phtml) which might be handled as PHP scripts. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with permissions to manage media items.

#### â¢ Solution:

Apply the vendor workaround or define a more secure âmedia\_exclusionâ setting (PCRE value).

#### â¢ Disclosure Timeline:

[14/05/2014] â Vendor notified

[15/05/2014] â Vendor response

[16/05/2014] â Version 2.6.3 released: <http://dotclear.org/blog/post/2014/05/16/Dotclear-2.6.3>

[16/05/2014] â CVE number requested

[19/05/2014] â CVE number assigned

[21/05/2014] â Public disclosure

#### â¢ CVE Reference:

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ([cve.mitre.org](http://cve.mitre.org)) has assigned the name [CVE-2014-3782](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3782) to this vulnerability.

#### â¢ Credits:

Vulnerability discovered by Egidio Romano.

Hi Brandon,

to exploit the vulnerability you need an account with the ability to access
to the dashboard (which can be granted e.g. with the "publish entries and
comments" or even with the "manage their own entries and comments"
permission), plus the ability to manage media items, that means you must
have the "manage their own media items" or "manage all media items"
permissions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Re: [KIS-2014-06] Dotclear <= 2.6.2 (Media Manager) Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability

Hi,

These are cool. Here is a Metasploit module for the file upload. You seem
to need the ability to publish as well the the ability to manage your own
media.

Feel free to edit as you would like and make a pull request!

## [Dotclear News](https://dotclear.org/blog/) » Dotclear 2.6.3

2014 May

By [Franck](http://open-time.net/) - [News](https://dotclear.org/blog/category/News)
- [Permalink](https://dotclear.org/blog/post/2014/05/16/Dotclear-2.6.3)

You can now download Dotclear 2.6.3. This maintenance release includes fixes for two potential security defaults on XML-RPC authentification and on category ordering. Many thanks to Egidio Romano for his advices about them.

He also warned us on the possibility to send PHP scripts into the media folder and to get them executed from there. Dotclear cannot entirely protect against this kind of defect and you should ensure to not leave such files in your medias, or if it's necessary, to make sure that they are not executable. In order to do so, a few methods exist and rely essentially on the web host and the sofware used for the server.

For Apache in example, a .htaccess file located in the public folder and including the following directive allows to avoid the issue:

```

php_flag engine off

```

Your dashboard should also offer you to upgrade your installation today or tomorrow (depending on your settings). There's also a [patch](http://download.dotclear.org/patches/2.6.2-2.6.3.diff.gz) for the developers who prefer this method.
