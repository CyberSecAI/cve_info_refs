- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The OpenPAM library incorrectly handles errors when parsing PAM policy files. Specifically, it treats a missing module referenced in a policy file the same way as a missing policy file, which causes it to continue searching for a policy even if it has partially loaded an invalid configuration.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Incorrect error handling in PAM policy parser.
    - Treating a missing module and a missing policy file as soft failures rather than hard failures.
    - Partially loaded configuration leading to unexpected behavior.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A fail-open scenario where users may be allowed to log in without a password or with an incorrect password. This could allow unauthorized access to systems. Especially impactful for Internet-facing services like SSH servers that are regularly subjected to brute-force attacks. The vulnerability can occur when a module is removed or a module name is misspelled in the policy file or include directive refers to a non-existent policy. This window of vulnerability is increased if modules are being reinstalled or upgraded.

- **Attack vectors**: 
    - Modifying PAM policy files to reference non-existent modules or misspelling module names.
    - Upgrading or reinstalling a module which is referenced in a PAM policy file, creating a brief window during which the policy will fail open.
    - Utilizing include directives in a policy that point to a non-existent policy file.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to modify PAM configuration files or trigger module upgrades.
    - The attacker does not need to be local, as an open SSH port would allow brute-forcing access.
