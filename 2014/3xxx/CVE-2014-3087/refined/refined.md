{
  "CVE-2014-3087": {
    "Description": "Service inputs can be passed into callService.do as URL parameters in an XML format. Because of insufficient input validation, XML injection attacks are possible.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input validation when processing XML service inputs passed as URL parameters.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "XML Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker might be able to inject scripts into callService.do using an XML entity in the service input parameters. This can result in an unhandled service failure, exposing sensitive data, and potentially returning local file content in the service failure error page.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting malicious XML within URL parameters to `callService.do`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send specially crafted HTTP requests to the affected application's `callService.do` endpoint."
