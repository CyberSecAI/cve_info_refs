Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenStack Keystone v2 trusts are handled. Specifically, when a trustee requests a trust-scoped token, the system incorrectly allows the trustee to specify a project ID different from the one the trust was created for. If the trustor has the necessary roles in this other project, the trustee is granted a token with those roles, effectively escalating privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Project ID Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of the project ID provided by the trustee when requesting a trust-scoped token. The system should ensure the project ID matches the one associated with the trust.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows a trustee, who should have limited permissions, to gain unauthorized access and potentially elevated privileges in projects other than the intended one. This occurs because the trustee can impersonate the trustor, assuming any of the trustor's roles in the specified project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious trustee can gain unauthorized access to other projects within the OpenStack environment.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The trustee can escalate their privileges to those of the trustor, thereby gaining the ability to perform actions that they would not normally be authorized to do in the targeted project.
*   **Data Breach:** In a worse-case scenario, the access could be used to view or modify data within the compromised project.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the OpenStack Keystone v2 API.
*   The trustee crafts a request for a trust-scoped token and specifies a project ID that is different from the one associated with the trust.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a trustee in an existing trust relationship within OpenStack Keystone.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of another project ID within the OpenStack environment where the trustor has the necessary roles
*   The attacker needs to use the v2 API.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Keystone versions up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1.
*   The fix was backported to Havana and Icehouse releases, and also included in the Juno release.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the v2 API.
*   The issue was reported by Jamie Lennox from Red Hat.
