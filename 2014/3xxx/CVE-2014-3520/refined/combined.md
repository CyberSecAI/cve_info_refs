### Bug Description

When you consume a trust in a v2 token you must provide the project id as part of your auth. This is a bug and should be reported after this.

If the trustee requests a trust scoped token to a project different to the one the trust is created for AND the trustor has the required roles in the other project then the token will be provided with those roles on the other project.

Attaching a script to show the problem.

The if (trust\_ref['project\_id'] and tenant\_id != trust\_ref['project\_id']): statement is because there is a test that explicitly checks that a trust may be created without specifying a project name.

I don't see why that would be a good idea.

So, this is an un-expected privilege escalation through an out of scope user supplied project id.

This should warrant an OSSA...

It appears to have been introduced at least in Havana, but it may be in Grizzly as well.

@Jamie Lennox: do you think this can be backported without a massive refactoring ?

+1 Impact description looks good.

Although I find this sentence a little wordy :

> a trustee may gain unauthorized access to another project if the trustor has the required roles to the other project.

But it still makes sense to me. Up to you if you tweak it.

Havana is not hard and attached. Grizzly seems to be a fairly major difference though some form of trusts is available there. Do we need to look at Grizzly?

Is there a separate patch for stable/icehouse? 0001-Ensure-that-in-v2-auth-tenant\_id-matches-trust.patch from comment 4 didn't apply.

I tried on master and it worked for me. A client can get a different error back if there's multiple problems with the request but that shouldn't be a problem.

Then we can proceed to stakeholder advance notification, Is this disclosure date ok for you ?

@Jamie Lennox, well it's not mandatory at all :) We prefer having someone from keystone-coresec to push patch in case of un-expected failures, but hopefully it's just a mater of applying patch and hitting git-review.

Looking at the commit message, it doesn't make sense:

Previously if a trustee requests a trust scoped token for a project that

is different to the one in the trust, however the trustor has the

appropriate roles then a token would be issued.

I think "however" is meant to be "if"

commit 96d9bcf230a74d6122a2b14e00ef10915c8f76e3

Author: Jamie Lennox <email address hidden>

Ensure that in v2 auth tenant\_id matches trust

Previously if a trustee requests a trust scoped token for a project that

    is different to the one in the trust, however the trustor has the

    appropriate roles then a token would be issued.

Ensure that the trust that was given matches the project that was

    specified in the scope.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

When you consume a trust in a v2 token you must provide the project id as part of your auth. This is a bug and should be reported after this.

If the trustee requests a trust scoped token to a project different to the one the trust is created for AND the trustor has the required roles in the other project then the token will be provided with those roles on the other project.

Attaching a script to show the problem.

The if (trust\_ref['project\_id'] and tenant\_id != trust\_ref['project\_id']): statement is because there is a test that explicitly checks that a trust may be created without specifying a project name.

I don't see why that would be a good idea.

So, this is an un-expected privilege escalation through an out of scope user supplied project id.

This should warrant an OSSA...

It appears to have been introduced at least in Havana, but it may be in Grizzly as well.

@Jamie Lennox: do you think this can be backported without a massive refactoring ?

+1 Impact description looks good.

Although I find this sentence a little wordy :

But it still makes sense to me. Up to you if you tweak it.

Havana is not hard and attached. Grizzly seems to be a fairly major difference though some form of trusts is available there. Do we need to look at Grizzly?

Is there a separate patch for stable/icehouse? 0001-Ensure-that-in-v2-auth-tenant\_id-matches-trust.patch from comment 4 didn't apply.

I tried on master and it worked for me. A client can get a different error back if there's multiple problems with the request but that shouldn't be a problem.

Thanks!

@keystone-coresec All three patches are almost the same, yet can someone have a look at that last icehouse backport please ?

Then we can proceed to stakeholder advance notification, Is this disclosure date ok for you ?

I'm okay with Tuesday, but with nobody chiming in it looks like it might get bumped to Wednesday the 2nd at this point?

@Jamie Lennox, well it's not mandatory at all :) We prefer having someone from keystone-coresec to push patch in case of un-expected failures, but hopefully it's just a mater of applying patch and hitting git-review.

Thanks Dolph for taking care of that. The disclosure date have been set to:

Looking at the commit message, it doesn't make sense:

Previously if a trustee requests a trust scoped token for a project that

is different to the one in the trust, however the trustor has the

appropriate roles then a token would be issued.

I think "however" is meant to be "if"

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-022
CVE: CVE-2014-3520
Date: July 02, 2014
Title: Keystone V2 trusts privilege escalation through user supplied
       project id
Reporter: Jamie Lennox (Red Hat)
Products: Keystone
Versions: up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 to 2014.1.1

Description:
Jamie Lennox from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Keystone trusts.
By using an out of scope project id, a trustee may gain unauthorized
access if the trustor has the required roles in the requested project
id. All Keystone deployments configured to enable trusts and V2 API are
affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/104216>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/104217>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/104218>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in
future 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.2 releases.
