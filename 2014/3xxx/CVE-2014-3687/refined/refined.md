    "Description": "The sctp_assoc_lookup_asconf_ack function in net/sctp/associola.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via duplicate ASCONF chunks that trigger an incorrect uncork within the side-effect interpreter.",
    "Root cause": "A race condition in SCTP's side effect interpreter related to handling duplicate ASCONF chunks. When a duplicate ASCONF is received the code re-queues a previously cached ASCONF_ACK chunk onto the output queue. When a later ASCONF chunk is processed, an uncork is triggered which leads to a kernel panic",
