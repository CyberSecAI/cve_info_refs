Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3160:

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-3160 is a Same-Origin-Policy bypass vulnerability in the handling of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files within the Chromium browser. This vulnerability could allow a malicious actor to potentially bypass security restrictions by controlling the way resources are fetched within an SVG file, allowing for cross-origin access that should normally be prevented.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper implementation of the same-origin policy when handling resources within SVG files, specifically in how the browser fetched resources referenced by the SVG.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Same-Origin Policy Bypass:** The core weakness lies in the browser's failure to enforce the same-origin policy correctly when fetching resources within SVG files.
*   **Cross-Origin Access:** This allows a malicious SVG file from one origin to access resources from a different origin without the necessary security checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:** A malicious actor might be able to steal data from other domains due to relaxed same-origin checks.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This could enable more complex attacks, potentially resulting in XSS by injecting malicious JavaScript into the context of another website.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** While not directly stated for CVE-2014-3160, other related vulnerabilities in this set, such as CVE-2014-3176 and CVE-2014-3177, could, in combination, lead to remote code execution outside of the browser's sandbox.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious SVG files:** Attackers would need to host or trick a user into opening a specially crafted malicious SVG file.
*   **Websites hosting vulnerable SVG resources:** It could also be exploited if a website uses SVG files it does not control and those files have malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to deliver or host malicious SVG files:** The attacker needs a way to get the victim to load a malicious SVG file (e.g., through a website, email, or other means).
*   **No special privileges on the target system are required** to exploit the vulnerability within a vulnerable browser.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was found and reported by Christian Schneider.
*   The fix is included in Chrome version 36.0.1985.125.
*   It was assigned a severity of "Medium" by the Chromium team.
*   Gentoo and Debian security advisories cover this vulnerability as part of a larger set of Chromium issues.
