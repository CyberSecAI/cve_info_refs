{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The luci application used the eval() function on inputs containing strings from the cluster configuration file when generating web pages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary code execution vulnerability due to the use of eval() on unchecked inputs.",
    "Improper input validation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with privileges to create or edit the cluster configuration could execute arbitrary code as the luci user on the host running luci, leading to privilege escalation and potentially full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker must have the ability to create or modify cluster configurations in luci, typically by having the 'create_cluster' or 'import_cluster' roles.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the privileges to create or edit the cluster configuration files. This usually requires some level of authentication or role access within the luci environment."
