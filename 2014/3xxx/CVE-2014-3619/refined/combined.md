# [Advisories](index.html) » MGASA-2015-0145

## Updated glusterfs packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 15 Apr 2015

Modification date: 15 Apr 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-3619](CVE-2014-3619.html)

## Description

```
Updated glusterfs packages fix security vulnerability:

glusterfs was vulnerable to a fragment header infinite loop denial of service
attack (CVE-2014-3619).

Also, the glusterfsd SysV init script was failing to properly start the
service.  This was fixed by replacing it with systemd unit files for the
service that work properly (mga#14049).

```

Upstream patch that, among other things, fixes this issue:  <http://review.gluster.org/#/c/8662/4>  The infinite loop could be triggered if a fragment header of '00000000' was sent, causing the code in __socket_proto_state_machine() to loop indefinitely.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1138145#c9)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-10-12 06:16:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Storage 3.0   Native Client for RHEL 5 for Red Hat Storage   Native Client for RHEL 6 for Red Hat Storage  Via RHBA-2015:0038 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2015-0038.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1138145#c10)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-10-12 06:16:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Common for RHEL 7  Via RHBA-2015:0040 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2015-0040.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=919879#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2015-02-27 08:11:15 UTC  ``` rh#1138145  A denial of service flaw was found in the way the __socket_proto_state_machine() function of glusterfs processed certain fragment headers. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted fragment header that, when processed, would cause the glusterfs process to enter an infinite loop.
