| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1145304#c0)  Josh Carter    2014-09-22 19:18:13 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Passwords that have been submitted to the database are retrievable in the UI.  Viewing the page, the password field is obfuscated with asterisks.  But viewing the HTML source, the password is clearly visible.  This password should be an encrypted hash of the password to protect it once it has already been accepted by the DB.  Some users may have Admin permissions within CloudForms but they are not provided passwords to other sensitive applications such as vCenter and Active Directory/LDAP.  But a user is able to look at HTML source and get these passwords.   As a security measure in the UI, this password should be an encrypted hash. Or once the password has been submitted to the database, it should have a link to update the password (challenge old pw, new pw, new pw).  It should not have the password unencrypted in the HTML source.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 5.2.5   How reproducible: very   Steps to Reproduce: log into CloudForms and navigate to Configure=>Configuration.  From left nav tree, select Settings and click on a server.  In the content window, click on the Authentication tab.  In the Role Settings area, click on the Bind Password field.  If using Chrome, right click and select Inspect Element (for other browsers, just view source and search for the Bind Password field).  The password is clearly visible in the HTML source.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1151258#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-10-10 00:30:17 UTC  ``` CFME: default password:  <https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/blob/master/vmdb/db/fixtures/customization_templates.yml#L7>  config file, requires user to not enter password, I think we should default to safe (e.g. either force a password to be set, or assign a random one), and  give this a CVE, giving them time for feedback.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1151258#c1)  Jason Frey    2014-10-10 20:48:43 UTC  ``` Interesting, I thought we decided this *wasn't* a security issue because it's not actually used.  It's a sample meant to show people how to set a default password.    Users *could* copy and reuse, hence the perceived problem, but it's not actively a security hole...it's not really even a bug.  Either way, I think in discussion we just decided to delete that line of code, since, again, it's just a sample.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1151258#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2014-10-15 04:08:52 UTC  ``` This issue is now public.   <https://github.com/ManageIQ/manageiq/commit/40f83e498edd5f91ab70ef538a9766bbe08e3d23>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1151258#c6)  Kurt Seifried    2015-01-08 16:01:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  This issue was discovered by the Red Hat CloudForms Team.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1151258#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-01-14 19:42:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    CloudForms Management Engine 5.3  Via RHSA-2015:0028 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0028.html>   ``` |  |

# RHSA-2015:0028 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: cfme security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0028)

## Topic

Updated cfme packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual
environments. CloudForms Management Engine is built on Ruby on Rails, a
model-view-controller (MVC) framework for web application development.
Action Pack implements the controller and the view components.

It was found that CloudForms Management Engine exposed SQL filters via the
REST API without any input escaping. An authenticated user could use this
flaw to perform SQL injection attacks against the CloudForms Management
Engine database. (CVE-2014-7814)

It was found that the CloudForms Management Engine customization template
used a default root password for newly created images if no root password
was specified. (CVE-2014-3692)

These issues were discovered by the Red Hat CloudForms Team.
