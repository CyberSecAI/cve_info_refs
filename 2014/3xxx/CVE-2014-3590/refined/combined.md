... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Foreman is aimed to be a Single Address For All Machines Life Cycle Management.

    Foreman integrates with Puppet (and acts as web front end to it).

    Foreman takes care of provisioning until the point puppet is running, allowing Puppet to do what it does best.

    Foreman shows you Systems Inventory (based on Facter) and provides real time information about hosts status based on Puppet reports.

    Foreman creates everything you need when adding a new machine to your network,It's goal being automatically managing everything you would normally manage manually - this include DNS, DHCP, TFTP, Virtual Machines, PuppetCA, CMDB etc.

    With Foreman You Can Always Rebuild Your Machines From Scratch!

    Foreman is designed to work in a large (and small) enterprises, where multiple domains, subnets and puppetmasters might be required. In many cases, Foreman could help remote provisions where no experienced technicians are available.

There is a package of foreman available from upstream, it works fairly
well (although upgrades seem to have a problem with debconf). I'd
suggest that someone might reach out to the upstream packager and work
with them to sponsor it for Debian.

Hi Micah, Laurent

I've just volunteered to be the maintainer of the Debian packages for
TheForeman, and one of our community pointed me towards this package
request.

I'm very happy to work with Debian to get TheForeman packaged
according to the Debian standards. I've done a bit of in-house
packaging in the past, so I'm no stranger to tools like pbuilder, but
I've never packaged anything official, so I'll happily take whatever
advice/sponsorship/mentoring etc. I can get.

Let me know what the next step would be - in the meantime, I'll be
practising on the nightly packages :)

Best regards,
Greg (@gwmngilfen on #theforeman)

Hi,

I have tried the debian packages for foreman to consider inclusion in
Debian.

There is a lot of work to do.

First off, the foreman-installer completely overwrites existing apache
configuration files, which is contrary to Debian Policy, c. 7.6.1:

<http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s7.6.1>

Also, the underlying packages do not seem to cleanup properly after
themselves:

root@puppet0:/etc# apt-get purge foreman-postgresql foreman
foreman-mysql2
Lecture des listes de paquets... Fait
Construction de l'arbre des dépendances
Lecture des informations d'état... Fait
Les paquets suivants ont été installés automatiquement et ne sont plus nécessaires :

pardon my french, but the last line says it can't remove the directory
because it's not empty. this is a violation of

Also, apt-get install foreman just fails:

Enabling debugging shows me:

/usr/sbin/foreman-rake db:migrate
You have requested:
  rails = 3.2.17

The bundle currently has rails locked at 3.2.13.
Try running `bundle update rails`
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.

... which basically means it will totally fail to install on wheezy,
which still has rails 2.3.

There's probably way more stuff i'm missing here.

In this condition, it is quite unlikely that foreman can get in debian
at all.

Having it installable on a simple wheezy environment would be a start. I
also strongly encourage you to run the package through "lintian" to make
sure it's properly built.

Looking forward to see Foreman in Debian...

Hi Antoine

Firstly, apologies for the slow reply - I've been on vacation, and
catching up with work :)

I'm really happy to discuss getting Foreman (and it's other packages,
such as the proxy and the installer) into Debian - that would be
fantastic.

My replies to your questions, and my own thoughts, are in-line...

On 17 April 2014 01:44, Antoine Beaupré <anarcat@debian.org> wrote:
> First off, the foreman-installer completely overwrites existing apache

The installer makes no changes to anything when the package is installed:

# dpkg -L foreman-installer | grep /etc/apache2 | wc -l
0

It also has no postinst or preinst scripts which could modify Apache
configuration.

Changes to the Apache configuration only happen when the installer is
executed by the user (which is intended, since Foreman's default
configuration is to use Apache).

I can't reproduce this I'm afraid. On a fresh Wheezy box:

Seems fine. This was using our nightly repo, but the same successful
result is obtained with the 1.4.x packages.

Testing this, it seems the Gemfile.lock is being left behind. I've
filed a bug[1] on the Foreman tracker to address this.

I've put these 3 comments together, because (in my opinion) this is
the largest problem in getting Foreman upstream. Currently there are
approximately 140 gems vendored in ~foreman/vendor/cache (including
Rails 3.2.17). Every single one of these would need to become a new
package in order to satisfy Debian's Ruby Packaging guidelines (as I
understand it), and I do not have time to do this (which is why they
are vendored).

This problem is compounded by versioning problems with popular gems
(such as Rails) - Foreman currently *requires* at least Rails 3.2.8,
and is likely to move to Rails 4 soon. Many other gem dependencies
move very quickly (often for security patches) so we'd need to make
sure we were being repsonsive to that, as well.

Until we have a clear plan of how to handle these gem dependencies,
getting the Foreman package itself upstream seems impossible (unless I
misunderstood, and Debian policy does indeed permit vendoring of gems)

As demonstrated above, the packages are installable. Without further
debugging, I can't speculate on why you hit the Rails version issue,
but that's the first time I've seen that error - and the wheezy
packages are well tested.

I've checked lintian and there's nothing massively serious, mostly a
few ruby-script-but-no-ruby-dep errors which can probably be easily
fixed at some point.

> Looking forward to see Foreman in Debian...
Likewise, if we can figure out what to do with the gems :) I'm always
available on Freenode if you want to discuss in real-time (nick:
gwmngilfen, channels: #theforeman, #theforeman-dev)

Greg

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1128108#c0)  Trevor Jay    2014-08-08 10:14:54 UTC  ``` It was found that foreman does not check for a correct CSRF token for the logout action. An attacker can therefore log out a user by having them view specially crafted content.  Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Jan Hutař of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1128108#c3)  Kurt Seifried    2015-03-04 18:46:56 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of foreman as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |
