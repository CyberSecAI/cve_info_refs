How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE-2014-3635 to 3639: security issues in D-Bus < 1.8.8

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an
asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used
for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other
operating systems.

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed
several security flaws in the reference implementation of
dbus-daemon, the D-Bus message bus daemon. fd.o #83622 is a heap
overflow and could potentially be exploited to alter data or executable
code; the rest are denial-of-service issues.

For the stable branch these are fixed in dbus 1.8.8.

For the old stable branch, these are fixed in dbus 1.6.24. Older
branches are not supported.

CVE-2014-3635 (fd.o #83622)
- ---------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=83622>
Category: CWE-805: Buffer Access with Incorrect Length Value
Impact: heap data corruption, worst-case: arbitrary code execution
Access required: local
Mitigation: 32-bit platforms are not vulnerable
Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0
Credit: discovered and fixed by Simon McVittie

When using the default Unix-socket-based transport, dbus-daemon accepts
and forwards file descriptors (fds) attached to D-Bus messages
("fd-passing"). If the max_message_unix_fds limit is set to an odd
number on 64-bit platforms, a malicious message-sender could pass one
more fd through the kernel than the recipient is expecting. This causes
an assertion failure and dbus-daemon crash if assertions are enabled, or
a buffer overrun by sizeof (int) otherwise.

This has been resolved by passing the desired maximum size to the
syscall instead of the rounded-up size of the cmsg buffer, and
discarding any excess fds if the syscall fills the cmsg buffer anyway.

CVE-2014-3636 (fd.o#82820, parts A and B)
- -----------------------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=82820>
Category: CWE-774: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles
Without Limits or Throttling
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

The default limits for the system bus allowed each uid to open 256
connections to the system bus, and allowed up to 1024 fds per message,
and up to 4096 fds queued in total on each connection.

(Part A) By queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious
sender could reach the dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically
65536 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:

* new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon
* when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that
  contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,
  indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs
  do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds
  to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service
  to that sender

(Part B) Additionally, Linux allows up to 253 fds to be sent in a single
sendmsg() call; libdbus always sends all of a message's fds, and the
beginning of the message itself, in a single sendmsg() call. Combining
these two, a malicious sender could split a message across two or more
sendmsg() calls to construct a composite message with 254 or more fds.
When dbus-daemon attempted to relay that message to its
recipient in a single sendmsg() call, it would receive EINVAL,
interpret that as a fatal socket error and disconnect the recipient,
resulting in denial of service.

Both of these related issues have been resolved by changing the defaults
so up to 16 fds are allowed per message, and up to 64 on each
connection. This means that each uid can only queue up to 16384 fds, and
denial of service is only possible if several uids cooperate.

Since this limit might be changed further in future, the D-Bus
maintainers recommend that designers of D-Bus APIs, particularly on the
system bus, do not rely on being able to send more than one fd per
message.

Distributors on operating systems with a smaller default RLIMIT_NOFILE
should consider adjusting either that limit, or the defaults in
system.conf.

CVE-2014-3637 (fd.o#80559)
- --------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80559>
Category: CWE-775: Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after
Effective Lifetime
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

By attaching the file descriptor of a D-Bus connection to a D-Bus
message and sending that message via the dbus-daemon, a malicious
process can create D-Bus connections that persist after the process that
created them has terminated. This exacerbates various patterns of
undesirable/abusive behaviour by making it impossible to terminate them
by killing processes.

This has been addressed by closing any connection that has incoming file
descriptors queued for deserialization for more than a configurable
timeout, defaulting to 2.5 minutes.

CVE-2014-3638 (fd.o#81053)
- --------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81053>
Category: CWE-407: Algorithmic Complexity
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: all dbus releases
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

dbus-daemon tracks whether method call messages expect a reply, so that
unsolicited replies can be dropped. As currently implemented, if there
are n parallel method calls in progress, each method reply takes O(n)
CPU time. A malicious user can exploit this by opening the maximum
allowed number of parallel connections and sending the maximum number of
parallel method calls on each one, causing subsequent method calls to be
unreasonably slow, a denial of service.

For the short term, this has been resolved by amending the default
system bus configuration to reduce the number of parallel method calls
allowed per connection, from 8192 to 128 (i.e. from 2097152 to 32768 per
uid).

Longer-term, we plan to use better data structures to make dbus-daemon
more scalable, but this was not felt to be suitable for a minimal
security patch.

CVE-2014-3639 (fd.o#80919)
- --------------------------

Bug: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80919>
Category: CWE-774: Allocation of File Descriptors or Handles Without
Limits or Throttling
Impact: denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: all dbus releases
Credit: discovered and fixed by Alban Crequy

dbus-daemon allows a small number of "incomplete" connections (64 by
default) whose identity has not yet been confirmed. When this limit has
been reached, subsequent connections are dropped. Alban's testing
indicates that one malicious process that makes repeated connection
attempts, but never completes the authentication handshake and instead
waits for dbus-daemon to time out and disconnect it, can cause the
majority of legitimate connection attempts to fail.

This has been resolved by reducing the default authentication timeout
from 30 seconds to 5 seconds, and pausing calls to accept() when the
maximum number of incomplete connections is reached, resulting in
subsequent connections being queued in the kernel (blocking in
connect()) instead of being dropped.

## Description

```
Updated dbus packages fixes the following security issues:

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in the
D-Bus message daemon:

On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by local users
to cause heap corruption in dbus-daemon, leading to a crash, or potentially
to arbitrary code execution (CVE-2014-3635).

A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local attackers to
prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect existing clients, by
exhausting descriptor limits (CVE-2014-3636).

Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to dbus-daemon which
could not be terminated by killing the participating processes, resulting
in a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2014-3637).

dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the code
which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local attackers to
reduce the performance of dbus-daemon (CVE-2014-3638).

dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from local users,
resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-2014-3639).

An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The DBUS-1 service and libraries were updated to upstream release 1.6.24
fixing security issues and bugs.
Upstream changes since dbus 1.6.8
+ Security fixes
- Do not accept an extra fd in the padding of a cmsg message, which
could lead to a 4-byte heap buffer overrun. (CVE-2014-3635,
fdo#83622; Simon McVittie)
- Reduce default for maximum Unix file descriptors passed per message
from 1024 to 16, preventing a uid with the default maximum number of
connections from exhausting the system bus' file descriptors under
Linux's default rlimit. Distributors or system administrators with a
more restrictive fd limit may wish to reduce these limits further.
Additionally, on Linux this prevents a second denial of service in
which the dbus-daemon can be made to exceed the maximum number of
fds per sendmsg() and disconnect the process that would have
received them. (CVE-2014-3636, fdo#82820; Alban Crequy)
- Disconnect connections that still have a fd pending unmarshalling
after a new configurable limit, pending\_fd\_timeout (defaulting to
150 seconds), removing the possibility of creating an abusive
connection that cannot be disconnected by setting up a circular
reference to a connection's file descriptor. (CVE-2014-3637,
fdo#80559; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for maximum pending replies per connection from 8192
to 128, mitigating an algorithmic complexity denial-of-service
attack (CVE-2014-3638, fdo#81053; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for authentication timeout on the system bus from 30
seconds to 5 seconds, avoiding denial of service by using up all
unauthenticated connection slots; and when all unauthenticated
connection slots are used up, make new connection attempts block
instead of disconnecting them. (CVE-2014-3639, fdo#80919; Alban
Crequy)
- On Linux >= 2.6.37-rc4, if sendmsg() fails with ETOOMANYREFS,
silently drop the message. This prevents an attack in which a
malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a system service,
which is a local denial of service. (fdo#80163, CVE-2014-3532; Alban
Crequy)
- Track remaining Unix file descriptors correctly when more than one
message in quick succession contains fds. This prevents another
attack which a malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a
system service. (fdo#79694, fdo#80469, CVE-2014-3533; Alejandro
Martínez Suárez, Simon McVittie, Alban Crequy)
- Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed a
denial-of-service flaw in dbus-daemon, part of the reference
implementation of D-Bus. Additionally, in highly unusual
environments the same flaw could lead to a side channel between
processes that should not be able to communicate. (CVE-2014-3477,
fdo#78979)
- CVE-2013-2168: Fix misuse of va\_list that could be used as a denial
of service for system services. Vulnerability reported by Alexandru
Cornea. (Simon)
+ Other fixes
- Don't leak memory on out-of-memory while listing activatable or
active services (fdo#71526, Radoslaw Pajak)
- fix undefined behaviour in a regression test (fdo#69924, DreamNik)
- path\_namespace='/' in match rules incorrectly matched nothing; it
now matches everything. (fdo#70799, Simon McVittie)
- Make dbus\_connection\_set\_route\_peer\_messages(x, FALSE) behave as
documented. Previously, it assumed its second parameter was TRUE.
(fdo#69165, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a NULL pointer dereference on an unlikely error path (fdo#69327,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- If accept4() fails with EINVAL, as it can on older Linux kernels
with newer glibc, try accept() instead of going into a busy-loop.
(fdo#69026, Chengwei Yang)
- If socket() or socketpair() fails with EINVAL or EPROTOTYPE, for
instance on Hurd or older Linux with a new glibc, try without
SOCK\_CLOEXEC. (fdo#69073; Pino Toscano, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a file descriptor leak on an error code path. (fdo#69182,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- Fix compilation if writev() is unavailable (fdo#69409, Vasiliy
Balyasnyy)
- Avoid an infinite busy-loop if a signal interrupts waitpid()
(fdo#68945, Simon McVittie)
- Escape addresses containing non-ASCII characters correctly
(fdo#53499, Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in \_dbus\_string\_init() or similar, don't
free an invalid pointer if the string is later freed (fdo#65959,
Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in dbus\_set\_error(), don't va\_end() a
va\_list that was never va\_start()ed (fdo#66300, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a regression test on platforms with strict alignment (fdo#67279,
Colin Walters)
- Avoid calling function parameters "interface" since certain Windows
headers have a namespace-polluting macro of that name (fdo#66493,
Ivan Romanov)
- Make "make -j check" work (fdo#68852, Simon McVittie)
- In dbus-daemon, don't crash if a .service file starts with key=value
(fdo#60853, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix an assertion failure if we try to activate systemd services
before systemd connects to the bus (fdo#50199, Chengwei Yang)
- Avoid compiler warnings for ignoring the return from write()
(Chengwei Yang)
- Following Unicode Corrigendum #9, the noncharacters U+nFFFE,
U+nFFFF, U+FDD0..U+FDEF are allowed in UTF-8 strings again.
(fdo#63072, Simon McVittie)
- Diagnose incorrect use of dbus\_connection\_get\_data() with negative
slot (i.e. before allocating the slot) rather than returning junk
(fdo#63127, Dan Williams)
- In the activation helper, when compiled for tests, do not reset the
system bus address, fixing the regression tests. (fdo#52202, Simon)
- Fix building with Valgrind 3.8, at the cost of causing harmless
warnings with Valgrind 3.6 on some compilers (fdo#55932, Arun
Raghavan)
- Don't leak temporary fds pointing to /dev/null (fdo#56927, Michel
HERMIER)
- Create session.d, system.d directories under CMake (fdo#41319, Ralf
Habacker)
- Include alloca.h for alloca() if available, fixing compilation on
Solaris 10 (fdo#63071, Dagobert Michelsen)

Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3635 CVE-2014-3636 CVE-2014-3637 CVE-2014-3638
                 CVE-2014-3639

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in
the D-Bus message daemon.

CVE-2014-3635

    On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by
    local users to cause heap corruption in the dbus-daemon crash,
    leading to a crash, or potentially to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2014-3636

    A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local
    attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect
    existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits.

CVE-2014-3637

    Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to
    dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the
    participating processes, resulting in a denial-of-service
    vulnerability.

CVE-2014-3638

    dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
    code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local
    attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.

CVE-2014-3639

    dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from
    local users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3635 CVE-2014-3636 CVE-2014-3637 CVE-2014-3638
                 CVE-2014-3639

Alban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in
the D-Bus message daemon.

CVE-2014-3635

    On 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by
    local users to cause heap corruption in the dbus-daemon crash,
    leading to a crash, or potentially to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2014-3636

    A denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local
    attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect
    existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits.

CVE-2014-3637

    Malicious local users could create D-Bus connections to
    dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the
    participating processes, resulting in a denial-of-service
    vulnerability.

CVE-2014-3638

    dbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the
    code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local
    attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.

CVE-2014-3639

    dbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from
    local users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.8-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

# USN-2352-1: DBus vulnerabilities

22 September 2014

Several security issues were fixed in DBus.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [dbus](/security/cves?package=dbus) - simple interprocess messaging system

## Details

Simon McVittie discovered that DBus incorrectly handled the file

descriptors message limit. A local attacker could use this issue to cause

DBus to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu

14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3635](/security/CVE-2014-3635))

Alban Crequy discovered that DBus incorrectly handled a large number of

file descriptor messages. A local attacker could use this issue to cause

DBus to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only

applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3636](/security/CVE-2014-3636))

Alban Crequy discovered that DBus incorrectly handled certain file

descriptor messages. A local attacker could use this issue to cause DBus

to maintain persistent connections, possibly resulting in a denial of

service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

([CVE-2014-3637](/security/CVE-2014-3637))

Alban Crequy discovered that DBus incorrectly handled a large number of

parallel connections and parallel message calls. A local attacker could use

this issue to cause DBus to consume resources, possibly resulting in a

denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3638](/security/CVE-2014-3638))

Alban Crequy discovered that DBus incorrectly handled incomplete

connections. A local attacker could use this issue to cause DBus to fail

legitimate connection attempts, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2014-3639](/security/CVE-2014-3639))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c0)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-08 18:00:03 UTC  ``` While investigating another bug I accidentally found another unlikely DoS.  More details when I've confirmed that this is embargoed. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c1)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-08 18:27:59 UTC  ``` While writing a regression test to investigate [Bug #82820](show_bug.cgi?id=82820 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2014-3636: using all available file descriptors in dbus-daemon: limit DEFAULT_MESSAGE_UNIX_FDS"), I discovered another weird DoS involving file descriptor passing.  If max_message_unix_fds is set to an odd number on 64-bit platforms, a malicious message-sender can crash the message recipient. (In general, the bad situation is that (max_message_unix_fds * sizeof (int)) % sizeof (size_t) is nonzero.)  This is because the recipient allocates enough space for a cmsg header (16 bytes on x86 Linux), plus padding to size_t alignment, plus an array of max_message_unix_fds (== *n_fds) ints, plus padding to size_t alignment. It is zero-filled.    m.msg_controllen = CMSG_SPACE(*n_fds * sizeof(int));   m.msg_control = alloca(m.msg_controllen);   memset(m.msg_control, 0, m.msg_controllen);  Let's suppose *n_fds is 7 for the sake of illustration. On my system, m.msg_controllen is 48:      ---- size_t aligned     0-15    cmsg header + padding (CMSG_LEN (0) == 16)     16-19   first fd     ...     40-43   seventh fd (CMSG_LEN (7 * sizeof (int)) == 44)     [44-47] padding (CMSG_SPACE (7 * sizeof (int)) == 48)     ---- size_t aligned  The only information that Linux has is m.msg_controllen. If the sender sends exactly one fd more than we wanted (i.e. exactly 8 fds), the kernel thinks "I need 16 bytes for the header and 32 bytes for these 8 fds, the dbus-daemon has given me exactly those 48 bytes, OK, I can fill them all" and does so.  Then we parse the cmsg header:               unsigned i;                _dbus_assert(cm->cmsg_len <= CMSG_LEN(*n_fds * sizeof(int)));              *n_fds = (cm->cmsg_len - CMSG_LEN(0)) / sizeof(int);                memcpy(fds, CMSG_DATA(cm), *n_fds * sizeof(int));              found = TRUE;  If assertions are enabled, dbus-daemon crashes with an assertion failure: cm->cmsg_len == 48, CMSG_LEN (*n_fds * sizeof (int)) == 44.  If assertions are not enabled, then we assign 8 to *n_fds, and memcpy 8 ints into a 7-int buffer. Bad news!  Mitigations:  * Platforms where cmsg is only aligned to int boundaries (e.g. i386)   are unaffected  * The default limit on the number of fds per message is not odd,   and approximately nobody changes the default arbitrary limits  * Assertions are normally disabled in production builds of dbus-daemon,   so we don't crash with an assertion failure (this would make matters   worse, potentially turning DoS into heap-smashing and arbitrary code   execution, if it wasn't for the third mitigation)  * loader->unix_fds is allocated with _dbus_realloc(), which is basically   libc realloc(), which is likely to round odd-sized allocations up to the   next 8- or 16-byte boundary; so writing 2*n ints into a buffer   intended for 2*n-1 ints will probably not actually overflow that buffer ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c2)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-08 19:36:43 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105917](attachment.cgi?id=105917 "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105917&action=edit "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=83622&attachment=105917) _dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding  If (*n_fds * sizeof (int) % sizeof (size_t)) is nonzero, then CMSG_SPACE (*n_fds * sizeof (int)) > CMSG_LEN (*n_fds * sizeof (int) because the SPACE includes padding to a size_t boundary, whereas the LEN does not. We have to allocate the SPACE. Previously, we told the kernel that the buffer size we wanted was the SPACE, not the LEN, which meant it was free to fill the padding with additional fds: on a 64-bit platform with 32-bit int, that's one extra fd, if *n_fds happens to be odd.  This meant that a malicious sender could send exactly 1 fd too many, which would make us fail an assertion if enabled, or overrun a buffer by 1 fd otherwise.  In practice, *n_fds == max_message_unix_fds, which defaults to an even number and is unlikely to be set to an odd number. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c3)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-08 19:37:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105918](attachment.cgi?id=105918 "New test for fd-passing") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105918&action=edit "New test for fd-passing") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=83622&attachment=105918) New test for fd-passing  ---  In particular, /odd-limit/plus1 exercises this bug. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c4)  Alban Crequy    2014-09-09 11:15:51 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 105917](attachment.cgi?id=105917 "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105917&action=edit "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=83622&attachment=105917) _dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding  Review of [attachment 105917](attachment.cgi?id=105917 "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105917&action=edit "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=83622&attachment=105917): -----------------------------------------------------------------  ::: dbus/dbus-sysdeps-unix.c @@ +386,5 @@ > +                 * someone could send us an extra fd per message > +                 * and we'd eventually run out. */ > +                for (i = (size_t) *n_fds; i < payload_len_fds; i++) > +                  { > +                    close (payload[i]);  This branch should not happen, but if it does, you close the fd and then set close_on_exec on the closed fd below.  @@ +398,5 @@ >   >              /* Linux doesn't tell us whether MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC actually >                 worked, hence we need to go through this list and set >                 CLOEXEC everywhere in any case */ > +            for (i = 0; i < payload_len_fds; i++)  Shouldn't you keep n_fds here, since the additional fds would be closed in the "else" branch?

Not the case, unless there's a flaw in my logic below:  > > +            for (i = 0; i < payload_len_fds; i++) >  > Shouldn't you keep n_fds here, since the additional fds would be closed in > the "else" branch?  *n_fds and payload_len_fds are numerically equal (to whichever of their previous values was the lesser) after either branch.  In the branch where payload_len_fds <= (size_t) *n_fds, I set *n_fds = (int) payload_len_fds. Note that the casts are valid, because *n_fds is known to be non-negative, and size_t is unsigned, so the condition implies that 0 ≤ payload_len_fds ≤ *n_fds, therefore payload_len_fds certainly fits in the range of int.  In the branch where payload_len_fds > *n_fds, I set payload_len_fds = (size_t) *n_fds. Again, the cast is valid, because *n_fds is known to be non-negative. Before changing payload_len_fds, I close the excess fds, payload[*n_fds]..payload[old(payload_len_fds)-1], because resetting payload_len_fds means that the memcpy and the cloexec loop will not extend to those fds.  The only reason I changed the limit of the cloexec loop from *n_fds to payload_len_fds is that i is now a size_t, so we'd need yet another cast (for (i = 0; i < (size_t) *n_fds; i++)) otherwise the compiler would (reasonably) warn us that we're comparing integers with different ranges.  Perhaps I could make this clearer by introducing another temporary variable? ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c6)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-09 11:51:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105975](attachment.cgi?id=105975 "[v2] _dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105975&action=edit "[v2] _dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=83622&attachment=105975) [v2] _dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds in  cmsg padding  ---  Perhaps this one is clearer, and easier to reason about?

I don't really want the test to hard-depend on a more modern GLib since I would like to merge it into stable-branches, hence this weird setup.  However, if I replace /dev/zero with a path that definitely exists on every reasonable Unix platform, like /bin/sh, I can just make it a g_error().

Users of libdbus (and probably every other D-Bus implementation) will attach fds to the sendmsg() that contains the first byte of the message, but a malicious sender could send a message in more than one sendmsg(), with (maybe an odd number of) fds in more than one part. Linux preserves message boundaries if fds are attached, so we'd receive them in more than one recvmsg(), with *n_fds reducing with each recvmsg() (possibly down to zero). ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c17)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-09 18:31:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105996](attachment.cgi?id=105996 "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds  in cmsg padding") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105996&action=edit "_dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds  in cmsg padding") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=83622&attachment=105996) _dbus_read_socket_with_unix_fds: do not accept extra fds  in cmsg padding  If (*n_fds * sizeof (int) % sizeof (size_t)) is nonzero, then CMSG_SPACE (*n_fds * sizeof (int)) > CMSG_LEN (*n_fds * sizeof (int) because the SPACE includes padding to a size_t boundary, whereas the LEN does not. We have to allocate the SPACE. Previously, we told the kernel that the buffer size we wanted was the SPACE, not the LEN, which meant it was free to fill the padding with additional fds: on a 64-bit platform with 32-bit int, that's one extra fd, if *n_fds happens to be odd.  This meant that a malicious sender could send exactly 1 fd too many, which would make us fail an assertion if enabled, or overrun a buffer by 1 fd otherwise.  ---  The only change is that I deleted the part of the commit message that said *n_fds would be even in practice, because we can't assume that. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c18)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-09 18:31:51 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 105997](attachment.cgi?id=105997 "New test for fd-passing") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=105997&action=edit "New test for fd-passing") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=83622&attachment=105997) New test for fd-passing  ---  Squashed version of what Alban already reviewed. ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c19)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-09 18:33:26 UTC  ``` Calling this a positive review because virtually nothing has changed since Alban said yes (I deleted one misleading paragraph from a commit message, and squashed all the test patches together). ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c20)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-09 18:36:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c15)) > When you squash all the patches, can you make sure the commit log in the > resulting patch references the bugzilla entry?

Let's say our buffer is sized for N ints, where N is such that libc does not over-allocate (in practice, this will be true, because we habitually choose "nice" limits). A malicious sender can split their message across two sendmsg() calls, putting N-1 fds in the first, and 2 fds in the second. In this case we still overrun the buffer by 1 fd.  So this is rather less theoretical than I had first thought, and needs fixing with correspondingly higher urgency. ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=83622#c29)  Simon McVittie    2014-09-16 16:37:32 UTC  ``` Fixed in 1.8.8, making public ``` |  |
