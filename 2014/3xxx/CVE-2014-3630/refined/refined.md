Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the Play Framework's `play.libs.XML` API and `play.libs.ws.WSResponse.asXml` method process XML data. They do not properly disable XML external entity (XXE) expansion by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core issue is the lack of proper configuration to prevent the expansion of external entities when parsing XML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML that can access local files, internal network resources, or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use XXE to read local files accessible to the user running the application server.
- **Denial of Service:** By crafting specific XML payloads with external entities, attackers can cause a denial of service.
- **Network Scanning:** Attackers could potentially use XXE to probe internal network resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Untrusted XML Input:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing malicious XML data to the vulnerable API. This can happen through:
  - Direct use of the `play.libs.XML` API to parse user-controlled XML.
  - `play.libs.ws.WSResponse.asXml` method when parsing XML responses from an untrusted server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to supply malicious XML to the application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Affected Versions:**
- Play Framework versions 2.0 to 2.3.4 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Play 2.3.5 and 2.2.6
- Developers should not use `play.libs.XML` to parse XML or `play.libs.ws.WSResponse.asXml` to parse XML responses from untrusted sources
- Instead developers should use a `DocumentBuilderFactory` that is securely configured as described by OWASP to parse the XML, after getting it from `getBody`

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability does not impact Java actions that receive requests with XML bodies or Scala XML processing APIs.
- The vulnerability was discovered by David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security.
- The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 4.0, with a temporal score of 3.1.
