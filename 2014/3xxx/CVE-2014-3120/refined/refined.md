Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-3120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in Elasticsearch's default configuration prior to version 1.2.0, where dynamic scripting was enabled and accessible through the REST API without authentication. This allowed arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The REST API was accessible without requiring authentication, meaning anyone with network access to the Elasticsearch instance could exploit the vulnerability.
- **Dynamic Scripting Enabled:** Elasticsearch allowed the execution of dynamic scripts, which were not sandboxed. This meant that arbitrary Java code could be executed directly on the server.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system did not sanitize or blacklist potentially harmful scripts, further exacerbating the risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers could execute arbitrary Java code on the server hosting the Elasticsearch instance.
- **File System Access:** Through the executed Java code, attackers could read from and append to files on the system. This is dependent on the permissions of the user running Elasticsearch.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  The RCE could lead to complete system compromise, including data exfiltration, denial of service, or further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API:** The primary attack vector was the Elasticsearch REST API, which did not require authentication.
- **Script_fields Parameter:** The exploit was carried out by injecting malicious Java code within the `script_fields` parameter of a search request.
- **JSON Payload:** Attackers crafted JSON payloads containing the malicious code to be executed by Elasticsearch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers needed network access to the vulnerable Elasticsearch instance.
- **Basic understanding of Elasticsearch API:** Understanding of Elasticsearch search API to inject the malicious payload via the script fields.
- **No Authentication Needed:** No prior authentication was needed, as the API was vulnerable by default.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided exploit code uses a javascript function `es_inject()` to craft the malicious payload and send it via a GET request.
-   The exploit can both read files from the server (using a `read_file()` function) and append content to files on the server (using a `write_file()` function). The ability to write allows for more severe attacks (e.g. adding an SSH key for persistent access).
-  The vulnerability was addressed in Elasticsearch 1.2.0 by disabling dynamic scripting by default.

This vulnerability is significant due to the potential for complete system compromise. The content provides a good description of the vulnerability and how it could be exploited.
