# [R4] Tenable Products Affected by OpenSSL Protocol Downgrade Vulnerability

Low

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Tenable's SecurityCenter is affected by at least one vulnerability due to the use of a third-party library, specifically [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).

SecurityCenter's use of OpenSSL made it vulnerable to [CVE-2014-3511](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3511), an issue with the ssl23\_get\_client\_hello function in s23\_srvr.c that could allow a remote, man-in-the-middle attacker to force the use of TLS 1.0 by triggering a ClientHello message fragmentation (aka a "protocol downgrade" attack). Once Tenable determined that one of the issues affected SecurityCenter, further testing was not performed to positively verify additional issues. Instead, Tenable opted to focus on integrating the latest version of OpenSSL which fixes all of them. As such, SecurityCenter might be affected by [CVE-2014-3512](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3512 ) and [CVE-2014-5139](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-5139).

Tenable's Nessus and PVS are technically affected by [CVE-2014-3508](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3508) (crypto/objects/obj\_dat.c OBJ\_obj2txt function information disclosure) due to them using the X509\_name\_oneline() function. However, both of them utilize it in command-line utilities that do not offer an attack vector that crosses privilege boundaries.

Note that additional vulnerabilities were fixed with the 1.0.1i release, but SecurityCenter is not affected by them. These include [CVE-2014-3505](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3505 ), [CVE-2014-3506](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3506), [CVE-2014-3507](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3507), [CVE-2014-3509](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3509), and [CVE-2014-3510](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3510).

Please note that Tenable strongly recommends that SecurityCenter and the Tenable Appliance be installed on a subnet that is not Internet addressable.

### Solution

Tenable has updated the products to address this issue. Please see the product-specific instructions below:

SecurityCenter:

Tenable has released a patch for all supported versions of SecurityCenter that addresses this vulnerability. This patch applies OpenSSL 1.0.1i, which is not affected. This patch has been tested on SecurityCenter versions 4.6.2.2, 4.7.0, 4.7.1, 4.8.0, and 4.8.1. Upgrade information can be obtained from:

<http://static.tenable.com/prod_docs/upgrade_security_center.html>

The patches can be obtained from:

<https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod_id=160>

OpenSSL-patch-Aug2014-rh6-64.tgz        3c007c799636763c56ae2fedaa063882

```

Tenable Appliance:

Tenable has released two patch scripts for all supported versions of the Appliance that address this vulnerability. The operating system patch updates the OpenSSL package to 0.9.8e-27.el5\_10.4, which is not affected. The SecurityCenter patch updates its OpenSSL package to 1.0.1i, which is not affected. This patch has been tested on Tenable Appliance 2.4.1-0, 2.4.1-1, 2.6.1, 2.6.2, and 2.8.1.

The patches can be obtained from:

https://support.tenable.com/support-center/index.php?x=&mod\_id=230

```

TA-TNS-2014-06.tar.gz      619e14f5e551b03c54670215e0f32912

```

Note that the previously released Apache support script (TNS-2014-04) must be applied first, to upgrade the Apache (and PHP if SC 4.8.1 is installed). If you upgrade to an appliance version prior to and including version 2.8.1, you will need to re-apply this patch.

Tenable has also released version 3.0.0 of the appliance which resolves this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the worst of
which could result in Denial of Service or Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/openssl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1j** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1j**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p2**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p3**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p4**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p5**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p6**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p7**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p8**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p9**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p10**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p11**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p12**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p13**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p14**revision >= **0.9.8z\_p15** |

### Background

OpenSSL is an Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) as well as a general
purpose cryptography library.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to cause a Denial of Service condition,
perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, or
bypass security restrictions.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-1.0.1j"

```

All OpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/openssl-0.9.8z_p2"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying these packages.

Package        : openssl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3505 CVE-2014-3506 CVE-2014-3507 CVE-2014-3508
                 CVE-2014-3509 CVE-2014-3510 CVE-2014-3511 CVE-2014-3512
                 CVE-2014-5139

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit, that may result in denial of service
(application crash, large memory consumption), information leak,
protocol downgrade. Additionally, a buffer overrun affecting only
applications explicitly set up for SRP has been fixed (CVE-2014-3512).

Detailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities can be found at:
<https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt>

It's important that you upgrade the libssl1.0.0 package and not just
the openssl package.

All applications linked to openssl need to be restarted. You can use
the "checkrestart" tool from the debian-goodies package to detect
affected programs. Alternatively, you may reboot your system.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u12.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1i-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

2014-09-09 10:13:46 UTC (releng/8.4, 8.4-RELEASE-p15)
CVE Name: CVE-2014-3506, CVE-2014-3507, CVE-2014-3508, CVE-2014-3510,
CVE-2014-3509, CVE-2014-3511, CVE-2014-3512, CVE-2014-5139
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
FreeBSD includes software from the OpenSSL Project. The OpenSSL Project is
a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured
Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength
general purpose cryptography library.
II. Problem Description
The receipt of a specifically crafted DTLS handshake message may cause OpenSSL
to consume large amounts of memory. [CVE-2014-3506]
The receipt of a specifically crafted DTLS packet could cause OpenSSL to leak
memory. [CVE-2014-3507]
A flaw in OBJ\_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as
X509\_name\_oneline, X509\_name\_print\_ex et al. to leak some information from
the stack. [CVE-2014-3508]
OpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuites are subject to
a denial of service attack. [CVE-2014-3510]
The following problems affect FreeBSD 10.0-RELEASE and later:
If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed
session and the server sends an ec point format extension it could write
up to 255 bytes to freed memory. [CVE-2014-3509]
A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the server to negotiate
TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions when the ClientHello message
is badly fragmented. [CVE-2014-3511]
A malicious client or server can send invalid SRP parameters and overrun
an internal buffer. [CVE-2014-3512]
A malicious server can crash the client with a NULL pointer dereference by
specifying a SRP ciphersuite even though it was not properly negotiated
with the client. [CVE-2014-5139]
III. Impact
A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial of service (application
crash, large memory consumption), obtain additional information,
cause protocol downgrade. Additionally, a remote attacker may be able
to run arbitrary code on a vulnerable system if the application has been
set up for SRP.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch:
The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable
FreeBSD release branches.
a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the
detached PGP signature using your PGP utility.
[FreeBSD 10.0]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-10.0.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-10.0.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-10.0.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.3]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.3.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.3.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.3.patch.asc
[FreeBSD 9.2, 9.1, 8.4]
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.patch
# fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-14:18/openssl-9.patch.asc
# gpg --verify openssl-9.patch.asc
b) Apply the patch. Execute the following commands as root:
# cd /usr/src
# patch < /path/to/patch
c) Recompile the operating system using buildworld and installworld as
described in .
Restart all deamons using the library, or reboot the system.
3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch:
Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64
platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility:
# freebsd-update fetch
# freebsd-update install
VI. Correction details
The following list contains the correction revision numbers for each
affected branch.
Branch/path Revision
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------
stable/8/ r269687
releng/8.4/ r271305
stable/9/ r269687
releng/9.1/ r271305

# Security Advisory-9 OpenSSL vulnerabilities on Huawei products

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20141008-OpenSSL
* Initial Release Date:
  Oct 08, 2014
* Last Release Date:
  Mar 11, 2015

Summary

This security advisory (SA) describes the impact of 9 OpenSSL vulnerabilities discovered in third-party software. (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2014-0816)

These vulnerabilities are referenced in this document as follows:

1.Information leak in pretty printing functions (CVE-2014-3508). A flaw in OBJ\_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as X509\_name\_oneline, X509\_name\_print\_ex et al. to leak some information from the stack. Applications may be affected if they echo pretty printing output to the attacker. OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers themselves are not affected.

The NVD link is: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3508>

2.Crash with SRP ciphersuite in Server Hello message (CVE-2014-5139). The issue affects OpenSSL clients and allows a malicious server to crash the client with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an SRP ciphersuite even though it was not properly negotiated with the client. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-5139

3.Race condition in ssl\_parse\_serverhello\_tlsext (CVE-2014-3509). If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed session and the server   sends an ec point format extension it could write up to 255 bytes to freed memory.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3509

4.Double Free when processing DTLS packets (CVE-2014-3505). An attacker can force an error condition which causes openssl to crash whilst processing DTLS packets due to memory being freed twice. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3505

5.DTLS memory exhaustion (CVE-2014-3506). An attacker can force openssl to consume large amounts of memory whilst processing DTLS handshake messages. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3506

6.DTLS memory leak from zero-length fragments (CVE-2014-3507). By sending carefully crafted DTLS packets an attacker could cause openssl to leak memory. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3507

7.OpenSSL DTLS anonymous EC(DH) denial of service (CVE-2014-3510). OpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuites are subject to a denial of service attack. A malicious server can crash the client with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuite and sending carefully crafted handshake messages.

The NVD link is: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3510>

8.OpenSSL TLS protocol downgrade attack (CVE-2014-3511). A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the server to negotiate TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions when the ClientHello message is badly fragmented. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force a downgrade to TLS 1.0 even if both the server and the client support a higher protocol version, by modifying the client's TLS records.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3511

9.SRP buffer overrun (CVE-2014-3512). A malicious client or server can send invalid SRP parameters and overrun an internal buffer. Only applications which are explicitly set up for SRP use are affected.

The NVD link is: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3512

The9 vulnerabilities affect the Huawei products that use OpenSSL. Some Products have provided the fixed versions.
