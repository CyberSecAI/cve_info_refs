## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

## Maintenance

### Security fixes

The [Vulnerability Management](/wiki/VulnerabilityManagement "VulnerabilityManagement") team provides advisories with patches for the two previous releases of OpenStack. Older releases may or may not be supported by their stable maintenance teams, see below.

### Stable branches

Stable branches are centralized efforts to maintain bugfixes and vulnerability fixes for released OpenStack project versions in ready-to-use branches.

#### Older releases

Older releases marked as EOL are no longer supported by the community.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1790)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and
AWS-style logins.

A flaw was found in the keystone catalog URL replacement. A user with
permissions to register an endpoint could use this flaw to leak
configuration data, including the master admin\_token. Only keystone setups
that allow non-cloud-admin users to create endpoints were affected by this
issue. (CVE-2014-3621)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original reporter.

The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1149736)

All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Neutron

There is a known issue in all Havana releases that results in Neutron DHCP agent constantly resyncing its state once a network and a subnet
is created with a gateway outside of it. To avoid this, users are encouraged to set force\_gateway\_on\_subnet to True in neutron.conf. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1304181](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1304181)

### Bug Description

Anyone that can create endpoints can read any value out of the config file. Some of the values in the config file are passwords and things that shouldn't be made available.

For example, I'm running and cloud and I allow someone to define their own endpoints for whatever reason... maybe they control their own subcloud. If the admin creates an endpoint with $(admin\_token), then queries the catalog, they can read the admin token out of the config file.

I don't know what the fix is. Maybe a whitelist of config options? Maybe leaving "secret=True" config options out of the dict is good enough?

Here's steps to recreate:

$ openstack service create --type test test

+-------------+----------------------------------+

| Field | Value |

+-------------+----------------------------------+

| description | None |

| enabled | True |

| id | 9251fab0a273454d84046c810b3503a7 |

| name | test |

| type | test |

+-------------+----------------------------------+

# Define an endpoint with $(admin\_token)s.

$ openstack endpoint create 9251fab0a273454d84046c810b3503a7 --publicurl '[http://something/$(admin\_token)s'](http://something/%24%28admin_token%29s%27)

+--------------+----------------------------------+

| Field | Value |

+--------------+----------------------------------+

| id | 164abc0b305e4ad998ac732cda569cd6 |

| publicurl | [http://something/$(admin\_token)s](http://something/%24%28admin_token%29s) |

| region | None |

| service\_id | 9251fab0a273454d84046c810b3503a7 |

| service\_name | test |

| service\_type | test |

+--------------+----------------------------------+

# Get a scoped token using curl.

I like whitelists because we can carefully select what can be used and it's much harder to accidentally have bad things fall through. Also there are things like IPs, ports, usernames, etc. not marked as secret that can used used in part as a social engineering attack.

On the other hand this could be very tedious to manage, but I can't imagine there is more than a handful of things that could be used in endpoints.

This has always seemed like a dumb feature to me - I'd love to simply drop it if no one is seriously using it, but that's obviously not a backportable solution. Maybe we can deprecate it for Juno, and introduce the whitelist as the simplest possible backportable solution?

It's a difficult fix, since it's one of those cases where a feature has corner case security consequences. You can't really remove the "feature" in stable release, since that would be changing behavior that people might rely on. So my suggestion would be to drop the "feature" in future versions, and document the corner case security issue ("don't let anyone create endpoints!") in a OSSN...

Adding keystone-coresec and ossg-coresec for more input on this.

The difficulty here is that we don't know how frequently this replacement/interpolation functionality is used, or how exactly it is being used.

For existing stable releases, we can certainly recommend that you don't delegate the ability to create endpoints to anyone other than the system admin. The problem is that some deployments may truly need to allow delegation of endpoint creation. In these cases, there is really no secure option to allow delegation of endpoint creation. Allowing a whitelist, or even having the ability to turn off the replacement/interpolation would at least give us a secure option for stable releases. These approaches are new configuration though, which is something we try to avoid for stable releases. It also requires getting the word out that configuration changes need to be made. It feels like we should do something for stable releases here.

We have moved away from the "nova compute" string substitution part of this issue but we do still use it for keystone ports iirc.

I think we could safely (with documentation) drop or greatly limit this feature (I agree it's dumb) in Juno. OSSN for stable/\* releases.

We could \*possibly\* also check the option secret flag before trying to do the substitution (which might be backportable).

+1 for dropping the feature in Juno.

+1 for doing a OSSA with a whitelisting fix for current stable releases.

I agree with Nathan that it is unacceptable to simply tell people to not use this feature as that will put some installations in a bind where they simply can't resolve the issue. A security fix is really necessary here.

I suppose whether we release an advisory depends on whether or not anyone does the work to propose backportable fixes to supported releases. I agree that if we do patch/work around this in stable for safety reasons, then an OSSA is warranted. In the meantime hopefully someone is making sure it's properly ripped out of master so we don't have to carry a workaround past Icehouse.

Aren't OSSA-level issues seen as an important priority with PTLs? It seems to me that OpenStack has matured to the point where we need to fix security problems. Simply hoping that someone will volunteer to backport something seems wrong to me. What do we need to do to improve this state of affairs?

The patch looks good from a security perspective, so +1.

A minor thing that should probably be addressed is to protect against the whitelist being None. In WhitelistedFormatter:\_\_init\_\_(), the set() function will fail if whitelist is None. This would require one to explicitly set the config to None instead of an empty list, but it's possible and we should protect against it. Here is the code I'm referring to:

+class WhiteListedFormatter(object):

+

+ def \_\_init\_\_(self, whitelist, data):

+ self.\_whitelist = set(whitelist)

In backporting the above patch to stable/icehouse, I also noticed that compute\_port should also be added to the default whitelist.

Thanks you folks for fixing this in stable too. Even if the stable patches introduce a new config option, considering the sane default I think we could now confirm the OSSA task.

@VMT thought ?

master patch in comment #13:

- tox -e py27,pep8

  - passed

- visual inspection

I'd prefer it if tenant\_id and user\_id weren't in the whitelist config option but were always allowed. These are values set by keystone and not from the config file, so the help text is kind of confusing (it says the values are in the config file) and a user might think they can remove those values, but it's probably going to break just about every deployment if they do.

Some minor suggestions on the patches:

1) It would be nice if the list in the default value for endpoint\_substitution\_whitelist was alphabetized.

2) The help text for the option should say that it's deprecated since config replacement will be removed in Juno.

3) I'd assume that WhiteListedFormatter does formatting, but it doesn't, so rename to FilterWhiteListedItems or something.

4) The sample config file should be updated.

  - passed, no endpoint with admin token.

I've uploaded new patches that address Brant's comments. All three branches have slightly different ways to handle tests so each has a slightly different test setup.

Tried out the patches in 23-25 and they all worked for me.

master:

- tox py27,pep8

-- passed

- visual inspection

I'd prefer it if tenant\_id and user\_id weren't in the whitelist config option but were always allowed. These are values set by keystone and not from the config file, so the help text is kind of confusing (it says the values are in the config file) and a user might think they can remove those values, but it's probably going to break just about every deployment if they do.

I'm also fine with the change as is.

- try it

-- Worked... no endpoint.

stable/icehouse:

- tox py27,pep8

-- passed

- visual inspection

-- LGTM

- try it

-- worked, got 500 error

stable/havana:

- tox py27,pep8

- visual inspection

-- LGTM

- try it

-- 500 error

Impact description draft #1:

Title: Configuration option leak through Keystone catalog

Reporter: Brant Knudson (IBM)

Products: Keystone

Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:

Brant Knudson from IBM reported a vulnerability in Keystone catalog url replacement. By creating a malicious endpoint a privileged user may reveal configuration options resulting in sensitive information, like master admin\_token, being exposed through service url. All Keystone setups that allow non-admin user to create endpoint are affected.

a couple of nits:

change "exposed through service url" to "exposed through the service url" (add the)

change "to create endpoint are" to "to create endpoints are" (add s)

Another nit I should have mentioned before:

change "allow non-admin user to" to "allow non-admin users to" (add s), or "allow a non-admin user to" (add a), either one works for me.

The rest works looks good to me.

However, if the user's ID contained no comma ('John Doe'), the Identity service grants token requests as expected. This was because the LDAP back end code of the Identity server did not properly escape special characters when creating search filters. This update adds the necessary escaping, thereby allowing the Identity server to perform LDAP search operations correctly. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2014-10-22 17:22:37 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

The certificate trust configuration settings were only taking effect with the startTLS operation, causing them to be ignored when using the LDAPS protocol. Consequence: Certificate validation errors would be encountered when using the LDAPS protocol to connect to an LDAP server, despite having the proper certificate trust options configured for the Identity service. Fix: The certificate trust options are applied for both the LDAPS protocol and the startTLS operation when using an encrypted connection to an LDAP server. Result: Encrypted connections to an LDAP server work properly with no certificate validation errors. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Clones: | [1140829](show_bug.cgi?id=1140829 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [Doc] Keystone LDAPS connection using CA certificate")  ([view as bug list](buglist.cgi?bug_id=1140829)) | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2014-11-03 08:47:44 UTC | | | Target Upstream Version: |  | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c2)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-10 16:41:39 UTC  ``` This is a valid bug, but it should also be possible to configure the CA certificate trust at the OpenLDAP library level on the Keystone system.  In the '/etc/openldap/ldap.conf' config file, the directory that contains trusted CA certificates is set in the TLS_CACERTDIR setting (which defaults to '/etc/openldap/certs').  There is a NSS database in here, where the certificate can be imported and trusted using the 'certutil' utility.  Has this approach been attempted?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c3)  Eric Rich    2014-09-10 17:30:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Nathan Kinder from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c2)) > This is a valid bug, but it should also be possible to configure the CA > certificate trust at the OpenLDAP library level on the Keystone system. >  > In the '/etc/openldap/ldap.conf' config file, the directory that contains > trusted CA certificates is set in the TLS_CACERTDIR setting (which defaults > to '/etc/openldap/certs').

Are you referring to the procedure listed in: <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_OpenStack_Platform/5/html/Cloud_Administrator_Guide/configuring-keystone-for-ldap-backend.html#configuring-keystone-for-ldap-backend-harden>  Does the following import the CA to the keystore (or is that an additional step).   # openstack-config --set /etc/keystone/keystone.conf ldap tls_cacertfile CA_FILE   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c4)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-10 18:46:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Eric Rich from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c3)) > (In reply to Nathan Kinder from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c2)) > > Are you referring to the procedure listed in: > <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/> > Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_OpenStack_Platform/5/html/Cloud_Administrator_Guide/ > configuring-keystone-for-ldap-backend.html#configuring-keystone-for-ldap- > backend-harden  No, this is a separate procedure.  >  > Does the following import the CA to the keystore (or is that an additional > step).  >  > # openstack-config --set /etc/keystone/keystone.conf ldap tls_cacertfile > CA_FILE  No, this does not import the certificate into the NSS database.  This command simply edits keystone.conf to add:  ------------------------------ [ldap] ... tls_cacertfile = <CA_FILE> ... ------------------------------  The procedure I mentioned previously is configuring the LDAP libraries on the system to trust a CA cert, which applies for anything using the LDAP libraries (including Keystone).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c6)  Stephen Gordon    2014-09-11 18:36:41 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1140819](show_bug.cgi?id=1140819 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Split backend does not provide ldap.set_option(ldap.OPT_X_TLS_CACERTFILE) for ldaps connections") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c7)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-11 20:53:51 UTC  ``` [Comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c5) is about a different issue ([bug 1058484](show_bug.cgi?id=1058484 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - [RFE][keystone]: Domain-specific backend support")).  Let's keep the conversation separate from this issue related to CA certificate trust.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c8)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-12 00:06:38 UTC  ``` There are two ways of configuring the CA trust for the OpenLDAP libraries that are used by Keystone:  Method 1: --------- 1 - Copy the file containing your CA certificate chain (in PEM format) to /etc/openldap/certs.  2 - Edit /etc/openldap/ldap.conf and add the following directive:    TLS_CACERT /etc/openldap/certs/<ca file>  Be sure to replace <ca file> with the filename that was chosen for your CA certificate chain.  Method 2: --------- 1 - Use certutil to import and trust your CA certificate chain into the NSS certificate database that is used by the OpenLDAP client libraries:    certutil -d /etc/openldap/certs -A -n "My CA" -t CT,, -a -i <ca file>  Be sure to replace <ca file> with the filename that was chosen for your CA certificate chain.  You can use a more appropriate certificate nickname for the '-n' option.  This nickname is used to identity the certificate in the NSS database.  2 - Confirm that the CA certificate was imported correctly:    certutil -d /etc/openldap/certs -L  Your CA certificate should be listed, and the trust attributes should be set to "CT,,".   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c9)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-12 01:04:04 UTC  ``` One more note to add to [comment#8](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c8) is that the Keystone service needs to be restarted for the changes to take effect.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c10)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-12 01:12:27 UTC  ``` A fix for this has been submitted upstream (for master - Juno):    <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/120954/>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c11)  Nathan Kinder    2014-09-12 01:19:16 UTC  ``` An upstream backport request for stable/icehouse has been submitted here:    <https://review.openstack.org/120959>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c14)  Nathan Kinder    2014-10-08 22:55:53 UTC  ``` This was addressed in the upstream 2014.1.3 release.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c16)  Udi Kalifon    2014-10-21 19:45:58 UTC  ``` Verified in: openstack-keystone-2014.1.3-2.el7ost.noarch python-keystone-2014.1.3-2.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1140152#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-11-03 08:47:44 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

Subject: [OSSA 2014-029] Configuration option leak through Keystone catalog
 (CVE-2014-3621)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-029
CVE: CVE-2014-3621
Date: September 16, 2014

Title: Configuration option leak through Keystone catalog
Reporter: Brant Knudson (IBM)
Products: Keystone
Versions: up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2.1

Description:
Brant Knudson from IBM reported a vulnerability in Keystone catalog url
replacement. By creating a malicious endpoint a privileged user may
reveal configuration options resulting in sensitive information, like
master admin_token, being exposed through the service url. All Keystone
setups that allow non-admin users to create endpoints are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/121889>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/121890>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/121891>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno release 2014.2.0 and in future
stable 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.3 releases.

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1688)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix two security issues and
multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack
Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style
logins.

A flaw was found in the keystone V3 API. An attacker could send a single
request with the same authentication method multiple times, possibly
leading to a denial of service due to generating excessive load with
minimal requests. Only keystone setups with the V3 API enabled were
affected by this issue. (CVE-2014-2828)

A flaw was found in the keystone catalog URL replacement. A user with
permissions to register an endpoint could use this flaw to leak
configuration data, including the master admin\_token. Only keystone setups
that allow non-cloud-admin users to create endpoints were affected by this
issue. (CVE-2014-3621)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting
CVE-2014-3621. Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original
reporter of this issue.

The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1146083)

This update fixes the following bugs:

* When using an LDAP back end, the Identity service failed with a 'Bad

search filter' error whenever a token request was made for a user whose ID
contained a comma (for example, 'Doe, John'). However, if the user's ID
contained no comma ('John Doe'), the Identity service grants token requests
as expected. This was because the LDAP back end code of the Identity server
did not properly escape special characters when creating search filters.
This update adds the necessary escaping, thereby allowing the Identity
server to perform LDAP search operations correctly. (BZ#1099628)

* Previously, if the Identity service encountered a failed connection to a

message broker, re-connection attempts kept failing as well. This was
because the Identity service tried to reconnect to the same failing message
broker, even if there were multiple hosts configured. This has been fixed
by making the reconnect() implementation select the next broker in the
list. As a result, when multiple broker hosts are provided, the Identity
service will try the next one in the list at every connection attempt.
This means that non-failure reconnect attempts will also switch from the
current broker to the next in the list. Hence, users should not rely on any
particular order when using brokers from the list. (BZ#1082669)

* The Identity service now logs successful authentications of users.

In previous releases, only authentication failures were logged.
(BZ#1098635)

* When using the LDAP back end and connecting to Active Directory

anonymously, trying to use the top-level suffix as the user\_tree\_dn (or
tenant/role\_tree\_dn) failed with a communication error. This is because the
Identity service attempted to chase returned referrals, which is not
allowed by default in Active Directory for security reasons. This update
adds a new configuration option to disable referral chasing for LDAP search
operations, namely chase\_referrals. When this option is disabled, the
Identity service will skip over any returned referrals without chasing
them. (BZ#1093833)

All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

### Bug Description

Anyone that can create endpoints can read any value out of the config file. Some of the values in the config file are passwords and things that shouldn't be made available.

For example, I'm running and cloud and I allow someone to define their own endpoints for whatever reason... maybe they control their own subcloud. If the admin creates an endpoint with $(admin\_token), then queries the catalog, they can read the admin token out of the config file.

I don't know what the fix is. Maybe a whitelist of config options? Maybe leaving "secret=True" config options out of the dict is good enough?

Here's steps to recreate:

$ openstack service create --type test test

+-------------+----------------------------------+

| Field | Value |

+-------------+----------------------------------+

| description | None |

| enabled | True |

| id | 9251fab0a273454d84046c810b3503a7 |

| name | test |

| type | test |

+-------------+----------------------------------+

# Define an endpoint with $(admin\_token)s.

$ openstack endpoint create 9251fab0a273454d84046c810b3503a7 --publicurl '[http://something/$(admin\_token)s'](http://something/%24%28admin_token%29s%27)

+--------------+----------------------------------+

| Field | Value |

+--------------+----------------------------------+

| id | 164abc0b305e4ad998ac732cda569cd6 |

| publicurl | [http://something/$(admin\_token)s](http://something/%24%28admin_token%29s) |

| region | None |

| service\_id | 9251fab0a273454d84046c810b3503a7 |

| service\_name | test |

| service\_type | test |

+--------------+----------------------------------+

# Get a scoped token using curl.

$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '

I like whitelists because we can carefully select what can be used and it's much harder to accidentally have bad things fall through. Also there are things like IPs, ports, usernames, etc. not marked as secret that can used used in part as a social engineering attack.

On the other hand this could be very tedious to manage, but I can't imagine there is more than a handful of things that could be used in endpoints.

This has always seemed like a dumb feature to me - I'd love to simply drop it if no one is seriously using it, but that's obviously not a backportable solution. Maybe we can deprecate it for Juno, and introduce the whitelist as the simplest possible backportable solution?

It's a difficult fix, since it's one of those cases where a feature has corner case security consequences. You can't really remove the "feature" in stable release, since that would be changing behavior that people might rely on. So my suggestion would be to drop the "feature" in future versions, and document the corner case security issue ("don't let anyone create endpoints!") in a OSSN...

Adding keystone-coresec and ossg-coresec for more input on this.

The difficulty here is that we don't know how frequently this replacement/interpolation functionality is used, or how exactly it is being used.

For existing stable releases, we can certainly recommend that you don't delegate the ability to create endpoints to anyone other than the system admin. The problem is that some deployments may truly need to allow delegation of endpoint creation. In these cases, there is really no secure option to allow delegation of endpoint creation. Allowing a whitelist, or even having the ability to turn off the replacement/interpolation would at least give us a secure option for stable releases. These approaches are new configuration though, which is something we try to avoid for stable releases. It also requires getting the word out that configuration changes need to be made. It feels like we should do something for stable releases here.

We have moved away from the "nova compute" string substitution part of this issue but we do still use it for keystone ports iirc.

I think we could safely (with documentation) drop or greatly limit this feature (I agree it's dumb) in Juno. OSSN for stable/\* releases.

We could \*possibly\* also check the option secret flag before trying to do the substitution (which might be backportable).

+1 for dropping the feature in Juno.

+1 for doing a OSSA with a whitelisting fix for current stable releases.

I agree with Nathan that it is unacceptable to simply tell people to not use this feature as that will put some installations in a bind where they simply can't resolve the issue. A security fix is really necessary here.

I suppose whether we release an advisory depends on whether or not anyone does the work to propose backportable fixes to supported releases. I agree that if we do patch/work around this in stable for safety reasons, then an OSSA is warranted. In the meantime hopefully someone is making sure it's properly ripped out of master so we don't have to carry a workaround past Icehouse.

Aren't OSSA-level issues seen as an important priority with PTLs? It seems to me that OpenStack has matured to the point where we need to fix security problems. Simply hoping that someone will volunteer to backport something seems wrong to me. What do we need to do to improve this state of affairs?

David Stanek is on vacation today, but sent me this master patch for review. This provides a whitelist configuration option with a reasonable default whitelist to support safe use cases.

It feels weird to review a patch that I'm also uploading, but +2

The patch looks good from a security perspective, so +1.

A minor thing that should probably be addressed is to protect against the whitelist being None. In WhitelistedFormatter:\_\_init\_\_(), the set() function will fail if whitelist is None. This would require one to explicitly set the config to None instead of an empty list, but it's possible and we should protect against it. Here is the code I'm referring to:

+class WhiteListedFormatter(object):

+

+ def \_\_init\_\_(self, whitelist, data):

+ self.\_whitelist = set(whitelist)

In backporting the above patch to stable/icehouse, I also noticed that compute\_port should also be added to the default whitelist.

Thanks you folks for fixing this in stable too. Even if the stable patches introduce a new config option, considering the sane default I think we could now confirm the OSSA task.

master patch in comment #13:

- tox -e py27,pep8

  - passed

- visual inspection

I'd prefer it if tenant\_id and user\_id weren't in the whitelist config option but were always allowed. These are values set by keystone and not from the config file, so the help text is kind of confusing (it says the values are in the config file) and a user might think they can remove those values, but it's probably going to break just about every deployment if they do.

Some minor suggestions on the patches:

1) It would be nice if the list in the default value for endpoint\_substitution\_whitelist was alphabetized.

2) The help text for the option should say that it's deprecated since config replacement will be removed in Juno.

3) I'd assume that WhiteListedFormatter does formatting, but it doesn't, so rename to FilterWhiteListedItems or something.

4) The sample config file should be updated.

- test

  - passed, no endpoint with admin token.

icehouse patch in comment #16:

- tox -e py27,pep8

  - I had to add oslo.utils to my venv for this to work... maybe we have to wait for a change to stable/icehouse for this?

I've uploaded new patches that address Brant's comments. All three branches have slightly different ways to handle tests so each has a slightly different test setup.

@Matthew, It likely doesn't apply cleanly because it builds on other changes. Do we need to come up with another patch for 2014.1.2.1 that doesn't include the other changes?

## Synopsis

Important: openstack-keystone security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1789)

## Topic

Updated openstack-keystone packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The OpenStack Identity service (keystone) authenticates and authorizes
OpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.
The Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including
user name and password credentials, token-based systems, and
AWS-style logins.

A flaw was found in the keystone catalog URL replacement. A user with
permissions to register an endpoint could use this flaw to leak
configuration data, including the master admin\_token. Only keystone setups
that allow non-cloud-admin users to create endpoints were affected by this
issue. (CVE-2014-3621)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original reporter.

The openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.
(BZ#1149748)

All openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
