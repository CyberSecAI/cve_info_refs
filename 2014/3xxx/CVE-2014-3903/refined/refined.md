Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3903:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Cakifo theme for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding within the Cakifo theme, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's web browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Defacing the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can inject malicious scripts through user-supplied inputs or by other means, and when a user visits a page that processes the malicious code, their browser executes the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into a page that is using the vulnerable Cakifo theme.
- The attacker requires a single instance of authentication which suggests that authenticated users may be able to trigger the vulnerability, or, that a user may need to be logged into the application to experience the exploit.
- The attacker can be remote from the target but can make network requests to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cakifo versions 1.0 to 1.6.1.
- The vendor, Jayj.dk, is no longer maintaining the site or theme.
- The CVSS v2 base score is 3.5, indicating a low severity vulnerability with a Medium Access Complexity.
