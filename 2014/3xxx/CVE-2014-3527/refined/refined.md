- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from how Spring Security handles CAS proxy ticket authentication. It uses information from the `HttpServletRequest`, which can be manipulated, to determine the CAS service associated with a proxy ticket. A malicious CAS service could exploit this by sending a request that appears to come from another trusted service, thus bypassing access control restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a lack of trust in the `HttpServletRequest` data used for CAS proxy ticket validation, allowing for an access control bypass. This is due to improper handling of the HttpServletRequest that is populated with untrusted information, which allows malicious clients to impersonate other CAS services.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a malicious CAS service to impersonate a trusted CAS service and gain unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities. This could lead to unauthorized data access or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a manipulated HTTP request from a malicious CAS service that uses a fabricated `HttpServletRequest` to trick Spring Security into thinking the request comes from a different, trusted CAS service. This results in a proxy ticket being incorrectly authenticated.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have access to a malicious CAS service that can generate and send proxy tickets to the targeted system. The attacker essentially needs to have control over a CAS Service that they can manipulate.
