## Description

Search Everything improves WordPress default search functionality without modifying any of the template pages. You can configure it to search pages, excerpts, attachments, drafts, comments, tags and custom fields (metadata) and you can specify your own search highlight style. It also offers the ability to exclude specific pages and posts. It does not search password-protected content. Simply install, configure… and search.

Search Everything plugin now includes a writing helper called Research Everything that lets you search for your posts and link to them while writing. You can also enable Power Search to research posts from the wider web (for WP3.7 and above).

#### Better WordPress search in three steps

* Activate
* Configure options
* Search!

#### What it does

Search Everything increases the ability of the default WordPress Search, options include:

It doesn’t search in my PDF/Word/Excel attachments

We know, this is not a bug. It’s not that easy to search through binary files.

Anyway, if there’s a will, there’s a way. Just ask us for a workaround and we’ll gladly help.

It doesn’t work

Read the installation guide.

It \*still\* doesn’t work

As others have noted, this plugin has been abandoned, and has broken sites’ search functions for quite some time. Don’t install this, and if you have it installed, delete it.

I am updating my rating for this plug-in.
The Search Everything plug-in used to work great and allow my Easy Digital Downloads content to be fully searchable. It appears that the functions which this tool uses have been deprecated since it stopped working with a recent WordPress update. Reinstalling doesn’t fix the issue.
This plug-in has been abandoned and does not work on modern WordPress installations.

### [Breaks WooCommerce order search](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/breaks-woocommerce-order-search/)

When the plugin is active, a backend search on the Orders page of WooCommerce always loads zero results. It’s just a custom post type so I’m not sure what the issue is but be aware if you use Woo.

Throws a fatal error when adding a new post with WP 5.3. We commented out the action on line:935 – which might break some functionality of the plugin, but at least we can add blog posts.

This plugin is completely outdated and breaks several other plugins, including Advanced Custom Fields. It should be removed from the directory. DO NOT USE.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
