{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application used a default salt value in `miq-password.rb` to protect stored passwords, negating the value of having a salt function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of a default, hardcoded salt value for password storage.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local attackers with access to the stored passwords could more easily perform brute-force attacks to recover the plain text versions of the passwords.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access to the stored passwords.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the CloudForms Management Engine server and its stored passwords."
