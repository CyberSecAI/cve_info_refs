- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Wicket uses a combination of session ID and URL to store page markup during redirects. It fails to check if the session is temporary (session ID is null), potentially leading to conflicts when multiple users with temporary sessions are redirected to the same URL simultaneously.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to the lack of proper session handling with temporary sessions when storing and retrieving page markup for redirects.
- **Impact of exploitation:** User A could potentially see the page markup intended for User B, revealing user-sensitive information when both users have temporary sessions and are redirected to the same URL at the same time.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a page parameter is changed, causing a redirect and subsequent storage/retrieval of page markup based on the session ID and URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a user of the web application along with at least one other user with a temporary session that gets redirected to the same URL, with the goal to steal the victim's page markup.
