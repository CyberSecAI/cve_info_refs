```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The ovirt-engine REST API was resolving external entities in XML API calls.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote attacker with valid credentials could exploit the XXE vulnerability to read files accessible to the user running the ovirt-engine JBoss server and potentially perform more advanced XXE attacks.
- Attack vectors: Sending crafted XML API calls to the ovirt-engine REST API.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have credentials to call the ovirt-engine REST API.
