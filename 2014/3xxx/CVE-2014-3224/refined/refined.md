- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in multiple Quidway switch products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper input validation, allowing for the processing of malformed packets.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to excessive resource consumption (e.g., memory), and potentially cause a system restart, leading to denial of service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted, malformed packets to the vulnerable switch products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must have established IP connectivity with a vulnerable device that is functioning as a client.
