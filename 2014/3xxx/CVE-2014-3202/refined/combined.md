### Bug Description

affects ubuntu

Hello,

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 with all the packages updated.

When the screen is locked with password, if I hold ENTER after some

seconds the screen freezes and the lock screen crashes. After that I

have the computer fully unlocked.

Marco Agnese

This bug is about the lockscreen being bypassed when unity crashes/restarts, which is a critcal security issue. The crash will be handled from [bug 1308750](/bugs/1308750)

I've recreated this and after holding the enter key for quite some time my screen was unlocked. I noticed the following in /var/log/syslog:

14:13 < infinity> jdstrand: If you're hunting down people to poke about this, can you (strongly) suggest that this needs two fixes? First, obviously it shouldn't crash, but second, a restart-post-crash of unity should \*always\* start locked.

14:13 < infinity> jdstrand: Since there's no way to 100% be sure you know the previous state, one can only assume a rexec may need to be locked, and may becomes must because of the uncertainty.

This probably needs two fixes: fix the crasher and making sure a restart of unity after a crash is locked.

To be clear, the "always restart locked" half of the fix is the more important bit. The crash is embarrassing, but crashes will happen, and we'll find others. Having it restart unlocked is bordering on unforgivable, and we should focus on fixing that first.

So both the linked branches built in silo 8, and when I tested it, this is what I found:

1. start unity

2. open terminal (Ctrl+alt+T)

3. type 'sleep 15 && killall -9 compiz'

4. lock screen

observe: screen locks, then unity crashes, then unity restarts locked. so far so good.

5. issue the same command in the terminal again

6. lock the screen again

observe: screen locks, then unity crashes... and doesn't come back.

I'm told this is not a regression (eg it's known that unity does not restart after the first crash) however this is significant because when unity does not restart, that terminal just stays open right there, and while it doesn't respond to keyboard input, it does respond to mouse input, so it's possible to issue commands as the logged-in user by copy & pasting (eg, select some text, right click -> copy, right click -> paste).

So if I'm an attacker and I'm in a position to trigger a crash in compiz, the whole "restarting locked" thing seems kind of weak, because all I have to do is crash compiz... twice. Granted the unity-free UI is quite limited, maybe there's a browser open and I can access the user's email, or whatever. it's still an attack vector.

robru: the fact that unity doesn't reload properly after some crashes it's related to to [bug #1308800](/bugs/1308800) (it seems upstart is not loading unity, so gnome-session is not reliable at all for this).

@kristian-erik-hermansen Cool find, but utterly irrelevant here. That bug is about users blindly trusting the screen to auto-lock (which they \_should be able to\_).

This bug is about the trust being broken even after they \_verified\_ that they had \_explicitly\_ locked their screens. That's (a) a very different issue (b) a very different severity of failure.

Well I thought the same, but it seems we still might get that fixed even

before ;-)

Just a sidenote: Unlike what the sensationalist article at heise.de from today suggests (which links here), this bug was fixed in a heroc effort over night \*before\* final release, the fix is on the 14.04 image that was released to end users.

While that particular bug was fixed before 14.04 was released, it's probably
worth assigning a CVE to it anyway for tracking purposes, since I have now
published a security update that corrects two more lock screen bugs.

Here's a summary:

Issue #1 (Before 14.04 came out):

Marco Agnese discovered that Unity 7.2.0 incorrectly handled entry activation on
the lock screen, resulting in the lock screen crashing and the session becoming
unlocked.

Reference:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1308572](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1308572)
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-team/unity/trunk/revision/3787>

Issue #2:

Giovanni Mellini discovered that Unity 7.2.0 could display the Dash in certain
conditions when the screen was locked. A local attacker could possibly use
this issue to run commands, and unlock the current session.

Reference:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1308850](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1308850)
<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-team/unity/trunk/revision/3789>
<http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2184-1/>

Issue #3:

Frédéric Bardy discovered that Unity 7.2.0 incorrectly filtered keyboard
shortcuts when the screen was locked. A local attacker could possibly use
this issue to run commands, and unlock the current session.

Reference:
[https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1313885](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1313885)
[https://code.launchpad.net/~3v1n0/unity/lockscreen-keys-disable/+merge/217528](https://code.launchpad.net/~3v1n0/unity/lockscreen-keys-disable/%2Bmerge/217528)
<http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2184-1/>

Could CVEs please be assigned to these three issues?

Thanks!

Marc.

### Bug Description

affects ubuntu

Hello,

I am running Ubuntu 14.04 with all the packages updated.

When the screen is locked with password, if I hold ENTER after some

seconds the screen freezes and the lock screen crashes. After that I

have the computer fully unlocked.

14:13 < infinity> jdstrand: If you're hunting down people to poke about this, can you (strongly) suggest that this needs two fixes? First, obviously it shouldn't crash, but second, a restart-post-crash of unity should \*always\* start locked.

14:13 < infinity> jdstrand: Since there's no way to 100% be sure you know the previous state, one can only assume a rexec may need to be locked, and may becomes must because of the uncertainty.

This probably needs two fixes: fix the crasher and making sure a restart of unity after a crash is locked.

To be clear, the "always restart locked" half of the fix is the more important bit. The crash is embarrassing, but crashes will happen, and we'll find others. Having it restart unlocked is bordering on unforgivable, and we should focus on fixing that first.

So both the linked branches built in silo 8, and when I tested it, this is what I found:

1. start unity

2. open terminal (Ctrl+alt+T)

3. type 'sleep 15 && killall -9 compiz'

4. lock screen

observe: screen locks, then unity crashes, then unity restarts locked. so far so good.

5. issue the same command in the terminal again

6. lock the screen again

observe: screen locks, then unity crashes... and doesn't come back.

I'm told this is not a regression (eg it's known that unity does not restart after the first crash) however this is significant because when unity does not restart, that terminal just stays open right there, and while it doesn't respond to keyboard input, it does respond to mouse input, so it's possible to issue commands as the logged-in user by copy & pasting (eg, select some text, right click -> copy, right click -> paste).

So if I'm an attacker and I'm in a position to trigger a crash in compiz, the whole "restarting locked" thing seems kind of weak, because all I have to do is crash compiz... twice. Granted the unity-free UI is quite limited, maybe there's a browser open and I can access the user's email, or whatever. it's still an attack vector.

robru: the fact that unity doesn't reload properly after some crashes it's related to to [bug #1308800](/bugs/1308800) (it seems upstart is not loading unity, so gnome-session is not reliable at all for this).

@kristian-erik-hermansen Cool find, but utterly irrelevant here. That bug is about users blindly trusting the screen to auto-lock (which they \_should be able to\_).

This bug is about the trust being broken even after they \_verified\_ that they had \_explicitly\_ locked their screens. That's (a) a very different issue (b) a very different severity of failure.

Well I thought the same, but it seems we still might get that fixed even

before ;-)

Just a sidenote: Unlike what the sensationalist article at heise.de from today suggests (which links here), this bug was fixed in a heroc effort over night \*before\* final release, the fix is on the 14.04 image that was released to end users.

Subject: Re: Ubuntu 14.04: security problem in the lock screen

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Issues #1, #2, and #3 are clearly within the scope of CVE, and have
their CVE IDs below. The common theme is "the user intended to lock
the screen, the UI indicates that the screen is successfully locked,
the user physically leaves, but this locking can then be bypassed by a
physically present attacker."

Two of the other bugs referenced within pages for #1, #2, and #3 are

  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/unity/+bug/1308572/comments/6](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/unity/%2Bbug/1308572/comments/6)

and

  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/49579](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gnome-screensaver/%2Bbug/49579)

Quite possibly, these should also have CVE IDs, but there are
potentially valid counterarguments. First, at a high level, neither of
these matches the "common theme" described above.

For 1308572/comments/6, one counterargument is that a user isn't
entitled to expect that screen locking will continue to work
flawlessly if he decides to kill arbitrary processes that are, more or
less, related to screen/display functionality. Also, the risk is very
low in the sense that, before a user physically left, it would usually
be obvious that the screen was not successfully locked. However, there
is conceivably a scenario in which killing compiz is a supported (or,
at least, reasonable) user activity, and the user must leave
immediately after a screen-locking attempt without waiting even a few
seconds.

For 49579, there are many ways to summarize the long discussion: here
is one of them. A typical end user may expect that automatic screen
locking succeeds regardless of what the user had been doing (e.g., if
the user was in the middle of a menu operation). A developer may
expect that automatic screen locking succeeds in cases where the
implementation is achievable in a reasonable amount of time. There are
(at least) three possible conclusions:

  1. The end user wins. This is a vulnerability regardless of what
     documentation exists, because it is unreasonable to expect an end
     user to learn about the failure conditions.

  2. This is a vulnerability if the documentation is not "good
     enough." For example, if the only documentation is bug 49579
     itself, maybe that's not enough.

  3. The developer wins. This is never a vulnerability. Yes, it would
     be nice for automatic screen locking to succeed in more cases,
     but this is not a high-value security feature for all users, and
     it's OK for development to use a "reasonable effort" approach
     rather than a "must cover every possible case at all costs"
     approach.

Hi,

This was discovered (and resolved) in pre-release Ubuntu 14.04. Whilst it
was only this status by 1 day, the exposure risk is to brave early adopters
and developers.

Whilst technically it was present in a Unity release, I cannot think of any
other consumer of Unity than Ubuntu. As the exposed version of Ubuntu
wasn't released, it would seem fair to consider the two together.

I am aware that on occasion CVE's have been issued for development
snapshots, but I haven't seen clear policy on this.

I am not sure if this should be considered widely distributed or not. It
would seem redundant to raise a CVE for inflight development snapshot.
Unless, you believe the exposure to warrant it?

I'm sure someone from Ubuntu Security will chime in, but thought it wise to
respond to avoid an ID being raised in potential error.

Thanks
