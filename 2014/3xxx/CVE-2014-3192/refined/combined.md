| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1151422#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-10 11:20:59 UTC  ``` The NavigationScheduler::schedulePageBlock function in core/loader/NavigationScheduler.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101, does not properly provide substitute data for pages blocked by the XSS auditor, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted web site.  <https://crbug.com/396544> <https://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?revision=179240&view=revision>  External References:  <http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2014/10/stable-channel-update.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1151422#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-10 11:23:17 UTC  ``` While WebKit contains NavigationScheduler, it does not seem to contain functionality corrected by the fix for this issue.  Note that XSS auditor is feature of the Chrome/Chromium browser, hence consider WebKitGTK versions unaffected.  I haven't investigated QtWebKit, it's likely unaffected too.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1151422#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-10-14 08:35:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Supplementary for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:1626 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1626.html>   ``` |  |

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/10/stable-channel-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, October 7, 2014

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 38 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 38.0.2125.101 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

- A number of new apps/extension APIs

- Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A full list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/37.0.2062.0..38.0.2125.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [159 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M38+-Security_Severity%3DNone), including [113 relatively minor fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M38+Stability%3DMemory-MemorySanitizer+&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Iteration+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles) found using [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 3.28 branch (currently 3.28.71.15).

Some of the above bugs were also detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer).
