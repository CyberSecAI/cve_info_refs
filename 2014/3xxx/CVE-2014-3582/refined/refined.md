- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of hostnames provided by agents when generating SSL certificates using OpenSSL commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OpenSSL parameter injection vulnerability. The Ambari server does not properly validate hostnames provided by the Ambari agents, leading to the possibility of injecting arbitrary commands via the hostname parameters when generating certificates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the Ambari server host.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a malicious hostname through an agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the hostname provided by an agent during the SSL certificate generation process.
