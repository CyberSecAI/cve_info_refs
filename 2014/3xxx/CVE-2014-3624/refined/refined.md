Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2014-3624:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content from the Apache Jira issue tracker (specifically TS-2677) directly relates to a bug in Apache Traffic Server that could be associated with CVE-2014-3624, though the CVE itself is not named in the issue. The issue describes a problem with the CONNECT method and remapping, which could lead to tunneling issues and internal state problems.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The core issue is that when using the CONNECT method in conjunction with URL remapping, the scheme of the request is modified. This modification disrupts the expected behavior of the client and the internal states of Traffic Server, leading to the connection not being tunneled properly. The vulnerability arises from how the remap functionality interacts with CONNECT requests.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Scheme Modification:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect modification of the request scheme during a CONNECT operation with remapping. This violates the expectation of the client, as clients initiating a CONNECT to an HTTPS destination would expect an HTTPS connection regardless of remapping.
*   **Incorrect Tunneling:** The modified scheme leads to a failure in proper tunneling. The Traffic Server's internal state and debug/logging information are affected.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disrupted Connections:** The primary impact is that the CONNECT requests are not properly tunneled through the proxy server.
*   **Client Misbehavior:** Clients are likely to misbehave or fail because the scheme is modified unexpectedly.
*   **Internal State Issues:** The internal state of the Traffic Server is impacted, leading to inconsistencies in debug, logging and potentially other areas.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a client sending a CONNECT request to a Traffic Server instance that uses URL remapping rules.
*   Specifically, the remapping rules need to be set up to alter the request scheme when a CONNECT request is received.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to send CONNECT requests to a vulnerable Traffic Server instance.
*   The attacker doesn't need any special privileges other than being able to send requests to the proxy. The misconfiguration of URL remapping is what triggers the issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Jira issue (TS-2677) gives more context and technical details than the basic CVE description.
*   The issue is marked as a "Bug" with a "Major" priority and was fixed in versions 5.0.0 and 5.1.1 of Apache Traffic Server.
*   The resolution involved preventing medications to the scheme when using CONNECT, thus preserving the client's expected scheme.
