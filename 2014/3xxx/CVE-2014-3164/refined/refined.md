{
  "related": true,
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check in the `ioctl` implementation in the Qualcomm Performance component kernel driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
        "Out-of-bounds Write"
    ],
    "impact": "A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the kernel with elevated privileges. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device, requiring a re-flash of the operating system to recover. Specifically, the `ioctl` implementation didn't properly validate the buffer size before performing memory operations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local malicious application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to install and run a malicious application on the target device",
        "Privileges to execute the vulnerable ioctl"
    ],
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-3164",
    "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is mentioned on the personal website of Scott Bauer, who discovered the bug and has a known public record of reporting other kernel vulns. This reference links to an AOSP code review, and indicates that the fix for this bug involved adding a bounds check to the `ioctl` implementation."
