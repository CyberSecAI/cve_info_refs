Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-3642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of an insecure `send` method within the `cfme/vmdb/app/controllers/application_controller/performance.rb` file of Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME).
- This method accepts user-supplied arguments, specifically through the `params[:compare_to]` parameter which is then used as the argument to the `send` method.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure use of `send` method:** The `send` method in Ruby allows calling any method on an object dynamically using a string. Using user-supplied input directly in `send` without proper sanitization or validation creates a vulnerability, as an attacker can control the method being called.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code directly takes the user-provided `params[:compare_to]` parameter and uses it as an argument to `send` without any checks to ensure that it is safe.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** By controlling the argument passed to `send`, an authenticated attacker can modify the program flow, potentially leading to privilege escalation. This could involve calling methods that the attacker should not have access to, or bypassing security checks, allowing them to gain elevated privileges within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP(S) requests:** The vulnerable code is accessible via HTTP(S) requests.
- **`params[:compare_to]` parameter:** The attacker manipulates the value of `params[:compare_to]` in the HTTP request. This parameter is then used as input to the vulnerable `send` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of Red Hat CloudForms.
- **Ability to send HTTP(S) requests:** The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP(S) requests to the CFME application and manipulate parameters like `compare_to`.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable code snippet:
  ```ruby
  747: p_rpt.where_clause[2] = @perf_record.send(@perf_options[:parent].underscore).id
  ...
  29: @perf_options[:parent] = params[:compare_to].blank? ? nil : params[:compare_to] if params.has_key?(:compare_to)
  ```
- The code takes the `params[:compare_to]` and uses it to call a method on `@perf_record`.

**Additional Notes**

- The issue was discovered by Jan Rusnacko of Red Hat Product Security.
- The vulnerability was fixed in CloudForms Management Engine 5.3 (RHSA-2014:1317).
- The bugzilla entry confirms this is a security vulnerability and identifies it as a privilege escalation issue.

This information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its causes, impact, and how it could be exploited. The content from the bugzilla report confirms that the root cause was indeed a dangerous use of `send` method with user-controlled input leading to potential privilege escalation.
