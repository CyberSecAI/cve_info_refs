      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_5b62b899_20250125_032007.html",
      "root_cause": "Unfiltered parameter in filemanager.php",

        "Reflected XSS (CWE-79)",
         "Local File Inclusion (LFI) (CWE-98)"
      ],
      "impact": "XSS can lead to arbitrary script execution in the victim's browser. LFI can lead to directory listing and potential access to sensitive files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By injecting malicious JavaScript into the 'viewdir' parameter of filemanager.php",
         "By using directory traversal sequences in the 'viewdir' parameter of filemanager.php"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted requests to the vulnerable web application. No authentication required.",
       "details": "The filemanager.php script does not properly sanitize user input provided via the 'viewdir' parameter. This allows for both reflected XSS and LFI vulnerabilities.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1.  **Reflected XSS:** By injecting javascript code within the viewdir parameter, the code is reflected back to the user in the 'return' input field, leading to XSS execution.\n2.  **LFI:** By supplying paths like '/home' in the 'viewdir' parameter, the application displays a directory listing of the specified path."
