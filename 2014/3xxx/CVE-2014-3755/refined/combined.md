-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Hi oss-security,

The Mumble team has just released Mumble 1.2.6, which contains fixes
for the two following vulnerabilities:

  Mumble-SA-2014-005  [<http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-005.txt>]
    - SVG images with local file references could trigger client DoS

  Mumble-SA-2014-006  [<http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-006.txt>]
    - The Mumble client did not properly HTML-escape some external strings
       before using them in a rich-text (HTML) context.

Prepend '.sig' to the advisory URLs for detached PGP signatures
(signed with my key).

We would also kindly request that CVEs be assigned for the above issues.

Thanks,
Mikkel Krautz on behalf of the Mumble Team

Mumble Security Advisory 2014-005
ID: Mumble-SA-2014-005
Date: May 2014
CVE Reference: Not assigned
Product: Mumble
Mumble Website: http://mumble.info
Permalink: http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-005.txt
Last Updated: 2014-05-14
1. Vulnerability
The Mumble client is vulnerable to a Denial of Service
attack when rendering crafted SVG files that contain
references to files on the local computer.
This can cause the Mumble client to hang and/or become
resource exhausted.
This issue can be triggered remotely by an entity
participating in a Mumble voice chat. Triggering
the issue remotely can be done using text messages,
channel comments, user comments and user textures/avatars.
2. Affected versions and configurations
All 1.2.x versions of Mumble are affected.
3. Mitigation
This issue can be mitigated by using a build of Qt
that does not include the QSvg module.
However, since Mumble uses SVGs for some of its UI
graphics, this might not be a satisfactory solution.
4. Details
Qt's QSvg module's SVG renderer will follow file references
found in SVG's image tag and XML stylesheet references.
For image tags, Qt tries to load the referenced file using
QImage's constructor that takes a file path. Further processing
is then delegated to an image format plugin.
For XML stylsheets, Qt will attempt to open the referenced
file using QFile followed by a call to the readAll(), which
will read the file until EOF.
These two possibilities makes it easy to cause a Mumble client
to hang by reading a file or file-like object that is exposed
using the filesystem namespace that QFile can access.
5. Credits
This issue was reported to the Mumble team by Tim Cooper
on April 16, 2014.
6. Fix
A fix for this issue has been released in Mumble 1.2.6.
The fix for Mumble 1.2.6 addresses this issue by removing
the Mumble client's ability to render SVG files received
from external sources. The binary releases of the Mumble
client for Windows and OS X also contain a patched version
of Qt that removes the code paths in QSvg that can trigger
local file access.
A patch that applies on top of Mumble 1.2.5 can be found at
http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-005.patch
(for a detached PGP signature, append '.sig').
The fix is also available in the Mumble git repo as
c7aecb2956f214cd83b7a862a4fcf15cc76c4450 (on the v1.2.6 branch).
The patch has been applied to Mumble's Qt tree is available
in the mumble-developers-qt tre as
2147fa767980fe27a14f018b1528dbf880b96814.
