  "cve": "CVE-2014-3700",
  "description": "eDeploy through at least 2014-10-14 has remote code execution due to eval() of untrusted data",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple code paths in eDeploy would call eval() with unsanitized user-supplied input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of eval() with unsanitized user input",
       "Unsafe directory handling situations",
       "Unsafe filename handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the eDeploy server and clients (in mitm type attacks).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "upload.py and upload-health.py: Exploitable by sending a crafted file via HTTP POST request.",
      "matcher.py: Requires tracing the code flow for the _list variable, likely vulnerable"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.",
     "required_positioning": "Remote, network access to the eDeploy server is required."
