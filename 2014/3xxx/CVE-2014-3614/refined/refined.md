{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A specific sequence of malformed packets can crash PowerDNS Recursor 3.6.0 remotely.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed packet with a label length greater than 63 octets, causing an unhandled exception that leads to a crash.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote denial of service (DoS) by crashing the PowerDNS Recursor service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a specific sequence of malformed DNS packets to the PowerDNS Recursor server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable PowerDNS Recursor instance. The 'allow-from' setting limits the source of the attack to the configured network ranges."
