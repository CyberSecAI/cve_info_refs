Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3773:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the presence of multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in `sources/main.queries.php` and within the files located in `sources/datatable/*` and the `datatable.logs.php` file located in the root directory. These injections occur due to improper sanitization and handling of user-supplied input within SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection in `sources/main.queries.php`:**
    *   The `login` POST variable in the "send\_pw\_by\_email" request is directly embedded into an SQL query without proper escaping, allowing SQL injection.
    *   Similarly, the `login` POST variable in the "generate\_new\_password" request is also vulnerable to SQL injection when constructing the SQL query to retrieve a password reset request key.

2.  **SQL Injection in `sources/datatable/*` and `datatable.logs.php`:**
    *   The `iDisplayStart` and `iDisplayLength` GET variables, which are used to construct the SQL query's `LIMIT` clause, are directly included in the SQL queries without proper sanitization, resulting in SQL injection.
    *   The `sSortDir_...` GET variable, intended for ordering the SQL result, is escaped using `mysql_real_escape_string` but not enclosed in apostrophes, allowing for SQL injection using specific characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Database Compromise:** Attackers could leverage these SQL injection vulnerabilities to dump the entire database, potentially exposing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
*   **Data Modification:** Malicious actors could use these vulnerabilities to modify database records or insert malicious data.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can potentially achieve remote code execution at the database and potentially operating system level through specific SQL injection techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Unauthenticated Access:** By exploiting the file execution bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-3771 and CVE-2014-3772), remote unauthenticated users can access the vulnerable scripts and inject SQL code via HTTP requests.
*  **Direct Access by Authenticated Users:** Authenticated users can directly exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities in  `sources/main.queries.php` by manipulating parameters in their requests.  The datatable related injection may also be accessible by authenticated users as part of the application functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the paths to the vulnerable PHP files or the specific API requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to construct and send HTTP requests with malicious SQL injection payloads.
*   **(For unauthenticated access):** The attacker needs to chain these with the file execution bypass vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-3771 and CVE-2014-3772)

**Additional Information from the Provided Content:**

* The provided content includes multiple code diffs that confirm the use of `mysql_real_escape_string` without enclosing the variables in apostrophes, as well as the lack of sanitization for other SQL parameters. The diffs also include changes to address the session protection bypass issues discussed in the advisory, however these are related to CVE-2014-3771 and CVE-2014-3772.

**In Summary:** CVE-2014-3773 highlights serious SQL injection vulnerabilities in TeamPass, stemming from insufficient input sanitization. This allows attackers to potentially achieve complete database compromise, data modification, or even remote code execution. The advisory and commit diffs provided detail the specific locations of these vulnerabilities and the steps taken to remediate them.
