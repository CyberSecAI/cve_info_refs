KVM: x86: Prevent host from panicking on shared MSR writes.The previous patch blocked invalid writes directly when the MSR
is written. As a precaution, prevent future similar mistakes by
gracefulling handle GPs caused by writes to shared MSRs.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144883#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-09-21 20:12:19 UTC  ``` If the guest writes a noncanonical value to certain MSR registers, KVM will write that value to the MSR in the host context and a #GP will be raised leading to kernel panic.  A privileged guest user can use this flaw to crash the host.  Enabling CONFIG_PARAVIRT when building the kernel mitigates this issue because wrmsrl() ends up invoking safe msr write variant.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1144883#c5)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-15 10:30:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Future kvm package updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 may address this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1144883#c6)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-24 16:07:21 UTC  ``` Upstream patches:  <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=854e8bb1aa06c578c2c9145fa6bfe3680ef63b23> <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=8b3c3104c3f4f706e99365c3e0d2aa61b95f969f>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1144883#c7)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-24 16:09:38 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1156543](show_bug.cgi?id=1156543 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-3610 kernel: kvm: noncanonical MSR writes [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1144883#c8)  Fedora Update System    2014-10-28 06:44:38 UTC  ``` kernel-3.16.6-203.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

KVM: x86: Check non-canonical addresses upon WRMSRUpon WRMSR, the CPU should inject #GP if a non-canonical value (address) is
written to certain MSRs. The behavior is "almost" identical for AMD and Intel
(ignoring MSRs that are not implemented in either architecture since they would
anyhow #GP). However, IA32\_SYSENTER\_ESP and IA32\_SYSENTER\_EIP cause #GP if
non-canonical address is written on Intel but not on AMD (which ignores the top
32-bits).
Accordingly, this patch injects a #GP on the MSRs which behave identically on
Intel and AMD. To eliminate the differences between the architecutres, the
value which is written to IA32\_SYSENTER\_ESP and IA32\_SYSENTER\_EIP is turned to
canonical value before writing instead of injecting a #GP.
Some references from Intel and AMD manuals:
According to Intel SDM description of WRMSR instruction #GP is expected on
WRMSR "If the source register contains a non-canonical address and ECX
specifies one of the following MSRs: IA32\_DS\_AREA, IA32\_FS\_BASE, IA32\_GS\_BASE,
IA32\_KERNEL\_GS\_BASE, IA32\_LSTAR, IA32\_SYSENTER\_EIP, IA32\_SYSENTER\_ESP."
According to AMD manual instruction manual:
LSTAR/CSTAR (SYSCALL): "The WRMSR instruction loads the target RIP into the
LSTAR and CSTAR registers. If an RIP written by WRMSR is not in canonical
form, a general-protection exception (#GP) occurs."
IA32\_GS\_BASE and IA32\_FS\_BASE (WRFSBASE/WRGSBASE): "The address written to the
base field must be in canonical form or a #GP fault will occur."
IA32\_KERNEL\_GS\_BASE (SWAPGS): "The address stored in the KernelGSbase MSR must
be in canonical form."
This patch fixes CVE-2014-3610.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service:

CVE-2014-3610

    Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM
    handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged
    guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (kernel panic) on the host.

CVE-2014-3611

    Lars Bull of Google reported a race condition in in the PIT
    emulation code in KVM. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o
    ports could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash)
    on the host.

CVE-2014-3645 / CVE-2014-3646

    The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security discovered
    that the KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully
    for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) and
    invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On
    hosts with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit
    support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions
    to crash the guest.

CVE-2014-3647

    Nadav Amit reported that KVM mishandles noncanonical addresses when
    emulating instructions that change rip, potentially causing a failed
    VM-entry. A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use this
    flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

CVE-2014-3673

    Liu Wei of Red Hat discovered a flaw in net/core/skbuff.c leading to
    a kernel panic when receiving malformed ASCONF chunks. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2014-3687

    A flaw in the sctp stack was discovered leading to a kernel panic
    when receiving duplicate ASCONF chunks. A remote attacker could use
    this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2014-3688

    It was found that the sctp stack is prone to a remotely triggerable
    memory pressure issue caused by excessive queueing. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to cause denial-of-service conditions
    on the system.

CVE-2014-3690

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that incorrect register handling in KVM
    may lead to denial of service.

CVE-2014-7207

    Several Debian developers reported an issue in the IPv6 networking
    subsystem. A local user with access to tun or macvtap devices, or a
    virtual machine connected to such a device, can cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

This update includes a bug fix related to CVE-2014-7207 that disables
UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload) in the macvtap, tun, and virtio_net
drivers. This will cause migration of a running VM from a host running
an earlier kernel version to a host running this kernel version to fail,
if the VM has been assigned a virtio network device. In order to migrate
such a VM, it must be shut down first.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.63-2+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Details

Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles

noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip

(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

([CVE-2014-3647](/security/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged

guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](/security/CVE-2014-3646))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

A bounds check error was discovered in the driver for the Logitech Unifying

receivers and devices. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this

flaw to to cause a denial of service (invalid kfree) or to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-3182](/security/CVE-2014-3182))

Raphael Geissert reported a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel's

CIFS client. A remote CIFS server could cause a denial of service (system

crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact by deleting IPC$ share

during resolution of DFS referrals. ([CVE-2014-7145](/security/CVE-2014-7145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-39-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-39.66~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-39.66~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-39-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-39.66~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-39.66~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Description

The WRMSR processing functionality in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not properly handle the writing of a non-canonical address to a model-specific register, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) by leveraging guest OS privileges, related to the wrmsr\_interception function in arch/x86/kvm/svm.c and the handle\_wrmsr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144883#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-09-21 20:12:19 UTC  ``` If the guest writes a noncanonical value to certain MSR registers, KVM will write that value to the MSR in the host context and a #GP will be raised leading to kernel panic.  A privileged guest user can use this flaw to crash the host.  Enabling CONFIG_PARAVIRT when building the kernel mitigates this issue because wrmsrl() ends up invoking safe msr write variant.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1144883#c5)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-15 10:30:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue does not affect Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0869)

## Topic

Updated kvm packages that fix two security issues are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for
Linux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. KVM is a Linux kernel module built for
the standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel.

It was found that KVM's Write to Model Specific Register (WRMSR)
instruction emulation would write non-canonical values passed in by the
guest to certain MSRs in the host's context. A privileged guest user could
use this flaw to crash the host. (CVE-2014-3610)

A race condition flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem
handled PIT (Programmable Interval Timer) emulation. A guest user who has
access to the PIT I/O ports could use this flaw to crash the host.
(CVE-2014-3611)

Red Hat would like to thank Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit for
reporting the CVE-2014-3610 issue, and Lars Bull of Google for reporting
the CVE-2014-3611 issue.

All kvm users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. Note: The procedure in
the Solution section must be performed before this update will take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

For details on how to apply this update, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

The following procedure must be performed before this update will take
effect:

1) Stop all KVM guest virtual machines.

2) Either reboot the hypervisor machine or, as the root user, remove (using
"modprobe -r [module]") and reload (using "modprobe [module]") all of the
following modules which are currently running (determined using "lsmod"):
kvm, ksm, kvm-intel or kvm-amd.

3) Restart the KVM guest virtual machines.

\* CVE-2014-3687: The sctp\_assoc\_lookup\_asconf\_ack function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel
through 3.17.2 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(panic) via duplicate ASCONF chunks that trigger an incorrect uncork
within the side-effect interpreter (bnc#902349).
\* CVE-2014-3688: The SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel before
3.17.4 allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
consumption) by triggering a large number of chunks in an
associations output queue, as demonstrated by ASCONF probes, related
to net/sctp/inqueue.c and net/sctp/sm\_statefuns.c (bnc#902351).
\* CVE-2014-3690: arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.2 on Intel processors did not ensure that the
value in the CR4 control register remains the same after a VM entry,
which allowed host OS users to kill arbitrary processes or cause a
denial of service (system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access,
as demonstrated by PR\_SET\_TSC prctl calls within a modified copy of
QEMU (bnc#902232).
\* CVE-2014-4608: Multiple integer overflows in the
lzo1x\_decompress\_safe function in lib/lzo/lzo1x\_decompress\_safe.c in
the LZO decompressor in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 allowed
context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
corruption) via a crafted Literal Run (bnc#883948).
\* CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.15.6 allowed local users to gain privileges
by leveraging data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and
an inet socket (bnc#887082).
\* CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the
parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allowed local users to cause a denial of
service (uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a
crafted iso9660 image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry
that has a CL entry (bnc#892490).
\* CVE-2014-5472: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a
crafted iso9660 image with a self-referential CL entry (bnc#892490).
\* CVE-2014-7826: kernel/trace/trace\_syscalls.c in the Linux kernel
through 3.17.2 did not properly handle private syscall numbers
during use of the ftrace subsystem, which allowed local users to
gain privileges or cause a denial of service (invalid pointer
dereference) via a crafted application (bnc#904013).
\* CVE-2014-7841: The sctp\_process\_param function in
net/sctp/sm\_make\_chunk.c in the SCTP implementation in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.4, when ASCONF is used, allowed remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system
crash) via a malformed INIT chunk (bnc#905100).
\* CVE-2014-7842: Race condition in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux
kernel before 3.17.4 allowed guest OS users to cause a denial of
service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application that performs an
MMIO transaction or a PIO transaction to trigger a guest userspace
emulation error report, a similar issue to CVE-2010-5313
(bnc#905312).
\* CVE-2014-8134: The paravirt\_ops\_setup function in
arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18 uses an
improper paravirt\_enabled setting for KVM guest kernels, which made
it easier for guest OS users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism
via a crafted application that reads a 16-bit value (bnc#909078).
\* CVE-2014-8369: The kvm\_iommu\_map\_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c
in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 miscalculates the number of pages
during the handling of a mapping failure, which allowed guest OS
users to cause a denial of service (host OS page unpinning) or
possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging guest OS
privileges. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect
fix for CVE-2014-3601 (bnc#902675).
\* CVE-2014-8559: The d\_walk function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.17.2 did not properly maintain the semantics of

certain tail pointer, which allowed remote attackers to obtain
sensitive cleartext information by reading packets (bnc#904700).
\* CVE-2014-9584: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 did not validate a
length value in the Extensions Reference (ER) System Use Field,
which allowed local users to obtain sensitive information from
kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image (bnc#912654).
\* CVE-2014-9585: The vdso\_addr function in arch/x86/vdso/vma.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.18.2 did not properly choose memory locations
for the vDSO area, which made it easier for local users to bypass
the ASLR protection mechanism by guessing a location at the end of a
PMD (bnc#912705).

## Details

Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles

noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip

(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

([CVE-2014-3647](/security/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged

guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](/security/CVE-2014-3646))

A flaw was discovered with invept instruction support when using nested EPT

in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine). An unprivileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the guest.

([CVE-2014-3645](/security/CVE-2014-3645))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-3673](/security/CVE-2014-3673))

A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(panic). ([CVE-2014-3687](/security/CVE-2014-3687))

It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory

pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-3688](/security/CVE-2014-3688))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual

Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel

processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of

service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging

/dev/kvm access. ([CVE-2014-3690](/security/CVE-2014-3690))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the

Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](/security/CVE-2014-4608))

It was discovered the Linux kernel's implementation of IPv6 did not

properly validate arguments in the ipv6\_select\_ident function. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by

leveraging tun or macvtap device access. ([CVE-2014-7207](/security/CVE-2014-7207))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel was not checking the

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN when remounting filesystems to read-only. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (loss of writability).

([CVE-2014-7975](/security/CVE-2014-7975))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

KVM: x86: Check non-canonical addresses upon WRMSR

```
Upon WRMSR, the CPU should inject #GP if a non-canonical value (address) is
written to certain MSRs. The behavior is "almost" identical for AMD and Intel
(ignoring MSRs that are not implemented in either architecture since they would
anyhow #GP). However, IA32_SYSENTER_ESP and IA32_SYSENTER_EIP cause #GP if
non-canonical address is written on Intel but not on AMD (which ignores the top
32-bits).

Accordingly, this patch injects a #GP on the MSRs which behave identically on
Intel and AMD.  To eliminate the differences between the architecutres, the
value which is written to IA32_SYSENTER_ESP and IA32_SYSENTER_EIP is turned to
canonical value before writing instead of injecting a #GP.

Some references from Intel and AMD manuals:

According to Intel SDM description of WRMSR instruction #GP is expected on
WRMSR "If the source register contains a non-canonical address and ECX
specifies one of the following MSRs: IA32_DS_AREA, IA32_FS_BASE, IA32_GS_BASE,
IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE, IA32_LSTAR, IA32_SYSENTER_EIP, IA32_SYSENTER_ESP."

According to AMD manual instruction manual:
LSTAR/CSTAR (SYSCALL): "The WRMSR instruction loads the target RIP into the
LSTAR and CSTAR registers.  If an RIP written by WRMSR is not in canonical
form, a general-protection exception (#GP) occurs."
IA32_GS_BASE and IA32_FS_BASE (WRFSBASE/WRGSBASE): "The address written to the
base field must be in canonical form or a #GP fault will occur."
IA32_KERNEL_GS_BASE (SWAPGS): "The address stored in the KernelGSbase MSR must
be in canonical form."

This patch fixes [CVE-2014-3610](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f8g7-wvf8-qh5r "CVE-2014-3610").

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle

faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register in the x86

architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9322](/security/CVE-2014-9322))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread

Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to

obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout

Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-8133](/security/CVE-2014-8133))

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock\_continue function of the Linux

kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). ([CVE-2014-9420](/security/CVE-2014-9420))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-375-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-375.92](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-375.92)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles

noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip

(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

([CVE-2014-3647](/security/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged

guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](/security/CVE-2014-3646))

A flaw was discovered with invept instruction support when using nested EPT

in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine). An unprivileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the guest.

([CVE-2014-3645](/security/CVE-2014-3645))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-3673](/security/CVE-2014-3673))

A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(panic). ([CVE-2014-3687](/security/CVE-2014-3687))

It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory

pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-3688](/security/CVE-2014-3688))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual

Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel

processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of

service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging

/dev/kvm access. ([CVE-2014-3690](/security/CVE-2014-3690))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the

Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](/security/CVE-2014-4608))

It was discovered the Linux kernel's implementation of IPv6 did not

properly validate arguments in the ipv6\_select\_ident function. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by

leveraging tun or macvtap device access. ([CVE-2014-7207](/security/CVE-2014-7207))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel was not checking the

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN when remounting filesystems to read-only. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (loss of writability).

([CVE-2014-7975](/security/CVE-2014-7975))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1456-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1456.76](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1456.76)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
