Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the password provided for executing the `chkauth` command is being logged in the audit log of the IBM Storwize V7000 Unified system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Password Logging:** The primary weakness is the logging of passwords in cleartext within the audit log. This exposes sensitive credentials.
*   **Insufficient Access Control to Audit Logs**: The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker who gains access to the audit log.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** If an attacker gains access to the audit logs, they can obtain the cleartext passwords used for authentication.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The compromised passwords could enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the authentication server or other systems that rely on those credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Access to Audit Logs:** The primary attack vector involves an attacker gaining unauthorized access to the audit logs of the IBM Storwize V7000 Unified system. This could happen through various means, including exploiting other vulnerabilities, compromised credentials, or insider threats.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Audit Logs:** The attacker needs access to the audit logs where the passwords are being recorded in cleartext. This implies some level of access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects IBM Storwize V7000 Unified versions 1.3.0.0 to 1.4.3.3.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability is addressed in version 1.4.3.4 and later of IBM Storwize V7000 Unified.
*   **Workaround:** The workaround suggested is to avoid using authentication servers that are not protected behind a firewall. This helps to limit the attack vector.
