              Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-3125 / XSA-91
                               version 3

    Hardware timer context is not properly context switched on ARM

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

This issue has been assigned CVE-2014-3125.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When running on an ARM platform Xen was not context switching the
CNTKCTL_EL1 register, which is used by the guest kernel to control
access by userspace processes to the hardware timers. This meant that
any guest can reconfigure these settings for the entire system.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest kernel can reconfigure CNTKCTL_EL1 to block
userspace access to the timer hardware for all domains, including
control domains. Depending on the other guest kernels in use this may
cause an unexpected exception in those guests which may lead to a
kernel crash and therefore a denial of service.

64-bit ARM Linux is known to be susceptible to crashing in this way.

A malicious guest kernel can also enable userspace access to the timer
control registers, which may not be expected by kernels running in
other domains. This can allow user processes to reprogram timer
interrupts and therefore lead to unexpected behaviour, potentially up
to and including crashing the guest. Userspace processes will also be
able to read the current timestamp value for the domain perhaps
leaking information to those processes.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onwards.

x86 systems are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

None.

CREDITS
=======

Chen Baozi discovered this issue as a bug which was then diagnosed by
Julien Grall.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

                               version 2

    Hardware timer context is not properly context switched on ARM

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When running on an ARM platform Xen was not context switching the
CNTKCTL_EL1 register, which is used by the guest kernel to control
access by userspace processes to the hardware timers. This meant that
any guest can reconfigure these settings for the entire system.

IMPACT
======

A malicious guest kernel can reconfigure CNTKCTL_EL1 to block
userspace access to the timer hardware for all domains, including
control domains. Depending on the other guest kernels in use this may
cause an unexpected exception in those guests which may lead to a
kernel crash and therefore a denial of service.

64-bit ARM Linux is known to be susceptible to crashing in this way.

A malicious guest kernel can also enable userspace access to the timer
control registers, which may not be expected by kernels running in
other domains. This can allow user processes to reprogram timer
interrupts and therefore lead to unexpected behaviour, potentially up
to and including crashing the guest. Userspace processes will also be
able to read the current timestamp value for the domain perhaps
leaking information to those processes.
