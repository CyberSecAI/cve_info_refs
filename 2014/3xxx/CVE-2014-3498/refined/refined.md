Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the improper handling of data from untrusted sources within Ansible. Specifically, when Ansible receives the results of remote commands in variables, the content of these variables is not properly filtered before being processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is triggered by the usage of Jinja2 templating engine. Ansible passes the unfiltered data through the Jinja2 template engine. This allows an attacker to inject template tags into the untrusted data which can be interpreted as code, leading to command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary command execution on the managing host under the UID of the running Ansible process. An unprivileged user on a system managed by Ansible can potentially execute code on the managing host with elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through injecting malicious Jinja2 template tags into data received from a remote host, which Ansible then processes without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control data that is returned by a remote system being managed by Ansible. This could involve a compromised remote system, or exploiting a vulnerability in a service that Ansible interacts with. The attacker can be an unprivileged user on the system being managed.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this issue involves sanitizing the untrusted data by removing template tags before processing.
- The vulnerability is present in Ansible versions prior to 1.6.6.
- The patch for the vulnerability can be found at: [https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/8ed6350e65c82292a631f08845dfaacffe7f07f5](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/8ed6350e65c82292a631f08845dfaacffe7f07f5)
