Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-3717:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Xen tools, when loading a 64-bit ARM guest kernel, did not properly validate the requested load addresses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Insufficient input validation. The tools failed to verify if the provided load addresses for the 64-bit ARM guest kernel were within acceptable bounds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:** By exploiting the lack of validation, an attacker could potentially cause an out-of-bounds read, copying data from the toolstack's address space (following the guest kernel in memory) into the guest's memory.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be used to crash the toolstack process, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker needs to control the kernel used to boot a guest.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to specify or control the kernel image used to boot a guest. This often implies control over the guest configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability, along with three others (CVE-2014-3714, CVE-2014-3715, and CVE-2014-3716), was addressed in Xen Security Advisory XSA-95.
*   The issue affects ARM systems running Xen versions 4.4 and later.
*   A patch was released to fix the issue.
