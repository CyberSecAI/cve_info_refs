The provided content relates to CVE-2014-3428.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user input within the web interface of Yealink VoIP phones.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The `model` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to XSS injection, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the user's browser. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking.
  - Cookie theft.
  - Defacement of the web interface.
  - Redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/servlet` endpoint of the Yealink phone's web interface. The vulnerable parameter is `model`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable Yealink VoIP phone. This might require the attacker to be on the same network as the phone or have the ability to reach it through other network paths.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and the appropriate XSS injection syntax.

**Technical details:**
The advisory provides a specific example of an XSS payload injected in the `model` parameter.
`GET /servlet?jumpto=dsskey&model=%22%20onmouseover%3dprompt%28 1337 %29%20badpuppy%3d%22&p=login&q=loginForm HTTP/1.1`
This payload includes the following:
- `%22` URL encoded double quote.
- `%20` URL encoded space.
- `onmouseover%3dprompt%28 1337 %29` -  an onmouseover event that triggers a javascript prompt.
- `badpuppy%3d%22` - junk used to attempt to close the quote.
This payload demonstrates a basic XSS injection, where hovering over the input could trigger the JavaScript `prompt` function.
