Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-3486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `MiqSshUtilV1.rb` and `MiqSshUtilV2.rb` utilities in Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME) create temporary files in the `/var/tmp` directory with predictable names based on the current time.
*   The utilities then execute commands by writing them to the temporary file, changing the file's permissions to 700 and executing it.
*   The time between file creation and permission change is vulnerable to a race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The temporary file names are predictable using `Time.now.to_i`.
*   **Time-of-check to Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:** There's a gap between creating the temporary file and setting its permissions during which a malicious actor can replace the file.
*   **Execution as Root:**  The temporary file is executed with root privileges through the `MiqSshUtil` utilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution as Root:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the system where CFME is installed. This is done by replacing the temporary file between the creation and chmod with a malicious script, which will then be executed as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where CFME is running.
*   **Race Condition Exploitation:** The attacker exploits the race condition between file creation and permission setting by quickly creating symbolic links to the temporary file, which can be used to then substitute the file for a malicious one

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account on the Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine server.
*   The attacker must be able to create symbolic links.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create files in the /var/tmp directory.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `shell_exec` method of `MiqSshUtilV1.rb` and the `temp_cmd_file` method of `MiqSshUtilV2.rb`.
*   The suggested fix is to use Ruby's `Tempfile` library to create temporary files more securely.
*   This vulnerability was discovered by Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was released in RHSA-2014:0816.
