Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of temporary files by the Lynis security auditing tool on non-AIX platforms. Specifically, the script uses `mktemp` to create a temporary file, but then appends `.unsorted` to the filename and redirects the output of find command to this file using `>> ${TMPFILE}.unsorted`. This introduces a race condition, allowing an attacker to create a symlink with name ${TMPFILE}.unsorted before the output redirection occurs, leading to the write operation being redirected to an arbitrary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symlink Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the vulnerability to a symlink attack. By creating a symbolic link to a target file, an attacker can redirect the output of the `find` command to an arbitrary file, causing potential data corruption or other malicious impacts.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability relies on a race condition, where an attacker needs to create the symlink before Lynis writes to the file. The small time window between the `mktemp` call and the output redirection makes this a possible vector.
- **Insecure Temporary File Handling:**  While `mktemp` is used for the initial temporary file, appending `.unsorted` to the filename and using `>>` for output redirection after creating a separate file with that name opens up the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker could overwrite arbitrary files on the system with content generated by the `find` command.
- **Data Corruption:** The output being appended to an arbitrary file could lead to data corruption, especially if the overwritten file is a configuration or executable file.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation (Indirect):** If an attacker can overwrite critical system files, this could potentially lead to privilege escalation or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where Lynis is being executed.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attack involves creating a symbolic link within the `/tmp/` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system, with the ability to create files and symbolic links in `/tmp/`.
- **Timing:** The attacker must win a race condition by creating the symlink before the Lynis script writes to the file.

**Additional Details:**

- The CVE specifically addresses the vulnerability on non-AIX platforms. The AIX case is covered under CVE-2014-3982 where it uses /tmp/lynis.$$ which is also vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on the Full Disclosure mailing list and later addressed by assigning CVE IDs.
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
   ```
   TMPFILE=`mktemp /tmp/lynis.XXXXXX`
    ...
    find ${I} -name "*.conf" -print >> ${TMPFILE}.unsorted
   ```
- The fix involves changing the way the output file is created or using a more secure method for temp file creation and writing to ensure atomicity.
