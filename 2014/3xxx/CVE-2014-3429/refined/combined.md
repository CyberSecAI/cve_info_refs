| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1119890#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-07-15 18:34:49 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that IPython's Notebook server suffered from a flaw where it did not verify the origin of websocket requests.  An attacker with knowledge of the IPython kernel ID could run arbitrary code on a user's machine with the privileges of the user running the IPython Notebook server, if the client visited a crafted malicious page.  This was corrected upstream [3] in the 2.0.0 release [4].  Further details on the flaw were also published [5].  The report that indicates versions 0.12 through to the fixed 2.0.0 release are vulnerable to this flaw.  As a result, the version of IPython shipped with EPEL5 (0.8.4) is not vulnerable to this issue as the vulnerable websocket code is not present.

# One Weird Kernel Trick

June 16, 2014![Kyle Kelley](https://github.com/rgbkrk.png)Kyle Kelley![Cover Image for One Weird Kernel Trick](/_next/image?url=%2Fassets%2Fblog%2Fwebsocket-hijacking-ipython%2Fcover.png&w=3840&q=75)![Kyle Kelley](https://github.com/rgbkrk.png)Kyle KelleyJune 16, 2014
# [Hijacking the IPython Notebook's WebSockets](#hijacking-the-ipython-notebooks-websockets)

**TL; DR** *On IPython ≤ 1.1, the Notebook server suffered from a flaw where it did not verify the origin of websocket requests. An attacker with knowledge of an active IPython kernel ID could run arbitrary code on a user's machine with the privileges of the user running the IPython kernel if the client visited a crafted malicious page. This was corrected upstream in the 1.2.0 and 2.0.0 releases.*

## [The IPython Notebook](#the-ipython-notebook)

For those that don't know, the IPython Notebook is an in-browser application for interactive computing where you can combine code, prose, mathematics, plots, and other rich media into a single document as well as [share with peers](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/):

![](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/rxluj5w6w1li9q_small.png)

The overall setup makes interactively working with code and data a breeze. Behind the scenes, the browser is communicating with IPython kernels (execution environments) over websockets.

![](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/huzp0asjwourg_small.png)

These websockets make communication with the kernels very quick, but they have additional security concerns.

## [Websockets and Cross Origin Restrictions](#websockets-and-cross-origin-restrictions)

Modern browsers prevent JavaScript on one site from accessing content on another site. This prevents, for example, `twitter.com` from accessing your bank accounts on `mint.com`.

The story is different for websockets. Unlike builtin cross origin handling by modern browsers, the websocket specification has no such concept. The protection has to be done by the server. Some methods include:

* Authenticating requests
* Verifying Origin and Host
* Validating a `Sec-WebSocket-Key`

If these aren't setup for a given server, any remote site that you visit can access the websockets on that server. `example.com` can, with client side javascript, open a websocket to `yourbank.com`, from the comfort of JavaScript in *your* browser.

## [Cross Origin Websockets and IPython](#cross-origin-websockets-and-ipython)

Prior to [pull request #4845](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/4845), the IPython Notebook did not perform origin verification. For notebook servers using authentication, this wasn't a problem (cookies are needed as part of authentication).

However, most users typically run the notebook locally with a default port (e.g. `127.0.0.1:8888`) and no authentication. It's only running on localhost not exposed to the web, what could go wrong? Well, an attacker could open `ws://127.0.0.1:8888/api/kernels/{some kernel id}` from their separate domain. Stated again, *any website could attempt to open up a websocket on your local machine with a little bit of JavaScript and knowledge of a kernel id*.

Simple example:

```
// Create a basic Kernel object
var kernel = new IPython.Kernel();

// Use the default URL
kernel.ws_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:8888";
// Prior to this, acquire a kernel_id
kernel.kernel_url = "/kernels/" + kernel_id;
kernel.kernel_id = kernel_id;

kernel.start_channels();

// ...
// Trigger execution once you know the kernel is connected
// (there's an event for that):
kernel.execute('import os; os.mkdir("touchdown")');
```

If a site can use a kernel without your knowledge, they can run *anything* they want *as you on your local, trusty machine*. [Remove all your files](/posts/rm-rf-remains), plop down some special purpose code, steal your data, and generally wreak havoc. Yikes.

### [Demo](#demo)

![](https://i.imgur.com/UscjI81.gif)

### [Verifying Origin and Host](#verifying-origin-and-host)

The vulnerability was fixed in time for the IPython 2.0 release (April 2014) and backported for the 1.x series (1.2 and above), as part of [#4845](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/4845). We simply verify that the origin of the request matches the host. To make sure this light amount of protection happened by default I also submitted a [pull request to the tornado web framework](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/pull/980).

This vulnerability is registered with
CVE ID [CVE-2014-3429](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3429).

## [Mitigations](#mitigations)

This entire attack relies on knowledge of the id of the kernel. Considering this is a [UUID generated using uuid4](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/rel-1.1.0/IPython/kernel/multikernelmanager.py#L105), this can't be brute forced in any reasonable amount of time. The more practical way is to use some amount of social engineering (see SciPy Gift Card demo below).

The only proactive mitigation you have if using an old version of the notebook is to set a password hash in your IPython Notebook configuration:

```
c.NotebookApp.password = u'sha1:c43e9fe995cb73d73aca557de521d48...'
```

To create a password hash, use `IPython.lib.passwd()`:

```
In [1]: from IPython.lib import passwd
In [2]: passwd()
Enter password:
Verify password:
Out[2]: 'sha1:67c9e60bb8b6:9ffede0825894254b2e042ea597d771089e11aed'
```

If you're stuck on an old version and haven't upgraded, please do! You'll also get access to IPython widgets if you upgrade to 2.x.

## [Lightning Talk at SciPy 2014](#lightning-talk-at-scipy-2014)

![](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/vg8f9kjehosdcq_small.png)

The inimitable [Paul Ivanov](https://twitter.com/ivanov) let me use him on stage as part of the exploit's demonstration. Paul loves Philz Coffee (it is, in fact, incredible coffee), so I set up a phishing site just for him:

![](https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/wsy2vdai9lbbxg_small.png)

While I was able to show Paul his kernel IDs in an iframe, normal CORS protections prevented my javascript from grabbing the IDs directly. Paul had to enter the "gift card code" (a kernel id for a running kernel) manually.

Doing so ran some deviously playful AppleScript that [Min](https://github.com/minrk) wrote to open Photobooth and take Paul's picture on stage:

```
var code = '%%bash\n' +
           'osascript -e \'tell application "Photo Booth" to activate\n' +
           'delay 6\n' +
           'tell application "Photo Booth"\n' +
           'activate\n' +
           'tell application "System Events" to keystroke return using {command down}\n' +
           'end tell\n\'';
```

There is an exploitation demo, but I've decided to tear that down and not link it because someone with a fortuitous network position (e.g. your router, your ISP, the person winking at you in the local coffee shop) could modify HTTP packets and run arbitrary code on your system. I'm willing to open source the demo though with enough pestering.

Today's post has been posted to [/r/python](http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2am4le/vulnerability_in_ipython_notebook_11_cross_origin/) as well as [/r/netsec](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/2ao18a/cross_site_websocket_hijacking_of_localhost_via/). Feel free to cross-post it and [PM me](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=lambdaops) so I can link it here.*

# IPython: Productive Interactive Computing

## Overview

Welcome to IPython. Our full documentation is available on [our website](http://ipython.org/documentation.html); if you downloaded a built source
distribution the `docs/source` directory contains the plaintext version of
these manuals. If you have Sphinx installed, you can build them by typing
`cd docs; make html` for local browsing.

## Dependencies and supported Python versions

For full details, see the installation section of the manual. The basic parts
of IPython only need the Python standard library, but much of its more advanced
functionality requires extra packages.

Officially, IPython requires Python version 2.6, 2.7, or 3.1 and above.

## Instant running

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide
by typing at the terminal:

```
$ python -m IPython

```

## Development installation

If you want to hack on certain parts, e.g. the IPython notebook, in a clean
environment (such as a virtualenv) you can use `pip` to grab the necessary
dependencies quickly:

```
$ pip install -e .[notebook]

```

This installs the necessary packages and symlinks IPython into your current
environment so that you can work on your local repo copy and run it from anywhere:

```
$ ipython notebook

```

The same process applies for other parts, such as the qtconsole (the
`extras_require` attribute in the setup.py file lists all the possibilities).

### Git Hooks and Submodules

IPython now uses git submodules to ship its javascript dependencies.
If you run IPython from git master, you may need to update submodules once in a while with:

```
$ git submodule update

```

or:

```
$ python setup.py submodule

```

We have some git hooks for helping keep your submodules always in sync,
see our `git-hooks` directory for more info.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=13744#c0)  David Walser    2014-07-15 17:47:27 CEST  ``` Details on a CVE issued for IPython in May were announced today (July 15): <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/07/15/2>  Cauldron is not affected as the issue was fixed in 1.2.  Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 3 and Mageia 4.  Advisory: ========================  Updated ipython package fixes security vulnerability:  In IPython before 1.2, The origin of websocket requests was not verified within the IPython notebook server. If an attacker has knowledge of an IPython kernel id they can run arbitrary code on a user's machine when the client visits a crafted malicious page (CVE-2014-3429).

Installed ipython-1.1.0-3.mga4, which pulled in about 50 other things. To play with it, in a terminal  $ ipython then copy/paste lines from:  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Cell%20Magics.ipynb>  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/IPython%20Kernel/Script%20Magics.ipynb> These all worked as described except re matplotlib, not found.  Updated to ipython-1.1.0-3.1.mga4 and re-ran the same tests, same results therefore deemed OK. Despite the fact that these tests have nothing to do with the fault described. The ipython site:  <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/> has many Python test scripts, under: - core - kernel - qt - testing I could not find how to launch iPython Qt. I think there is a way of directly running these Python scripts from ipython citing the URL (rather than downloading & saving them). That would be excellent for Python update testing. ```  ---   CC: (none) => lewyssmithWhiteboard: MGA3TOO => MGA3TOO MGA4-64-OK  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=13744#c2)  Philippe Makowski    2014-07-16 19:31:13 CEST  ``` python-matplotlib and python-qt4 are only suggests, so you certainly need to install them (or python3-matplotlib and python"-qt4 if you test python3-ipython in mga5) ```  ---   CC: (none) => makowski.mageia  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=13744#c3)  David Remy    2014-07-19 04:51:13 CEST  ``` Testing mga4-32 and ran same tests as Lewis had in #1 on ipython-1.1.0-3.mga4.

Since CORS headers don't exist in WebSockets land, we need to check origin and host. This adds origin and host checking within the WebSocketHandler.

The opinionated piece of this PR is that cross origin is disabled by default.

If a user wants different behavior, they'll need to override `check_origin`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Since `websocket_connect` doesn't set origin or host and is used in conjunction with `WebSocketHandler`s, this is definitely going to fail tests for the moment. I'll have to look deeper in the tests, but would love some feedback on this PR. |

| We should definitely make it easy for applications to check the origin header, and it should probably be turned on by default (I'm not 100% convinced here, but I was surprised when I learned that cross-origin websockets were allowed by default so it's probably better to be conservative). A request with no origin header should probably be allowed rather than rejected - browsers always send the origin, so a request without one is coming from a source where the origin header would provide no meaningful authentication anyway.  Because of proxies like nginx and haproxy, a tornado server doesn't necessarily know its correct origin (it may be listening on another port than the one the client connects to). We need some way to tell Tornado of its true origin. This could either be another option at the WebSocketHandler level, or perhaps we could put it on HTTPServer to make it a part of the incoming request (by analogy with the existing `protocol` option there).  You added the `allow_cross_origin` argument to `_execute`, but it's not really feasible for applications to pass in arguments here. This should probably be managed via a new overridable method, similar to `allow_draft76`. Maybe structure it as `check_origin(self, origin)` so applications can choose to allow selected non-same origins.  When comparing origins the default ports `:80` and `:443` are optional and should probably be either added or removed from both sides of the comparison for consistency. |

| [@bdarnell](https://github.com/bdarnell) - Thank you so much for the excellent feedback! I'm never sure how PRs out of nowhere will be received on a project.  A request with no origin header should probably be allowed rather than rejected - browsers always send the origin, so a request without one is coming from a source where the origin header would provide no meaningful authentication anyway.  It is a protection for endusers on a browser, so that's completely sane. I'll change to match that.  Because of proxies like nginx and haproxy, a tornado server doesn't necessarily know its correct origin (it may be listening on another port than the one the client connects to).  The `Host` header is actually passed by the browser as well. I did some testing with nginx where the host name is different (tornado server running only on localhost, nginx forwarding to another interface). [@minrk](https://github.com/minrk) tested it with SSH tunnels and node-http-proxy, but again only with browsers.  This should probably be managed via a new overridable method, similar to allow\_draft76. Maybe structure it as check\_origin(self, origin) so applications can choose to allow selected non-same origins.  Just the feedback I needed. Wasn't quite sure how to structure this. That's a really good idea. Disable by default but let users override how the checking is done, to include checking for particular origins?  When comparing origins the default ports :80 and :443 are optional and should probably be either added or removed from both sides of the comparison for consistency.  In the server I'm using, which is a client side application, the ports are actually high ports and do appear both on the origin and the header. I can provide samples of this directly to you if necessary.   ---   I submitted this on the road but I'll be back to it soon, including getting tests to pass (and adding some). |

| While adding tests, I noticed how terrible of an interface I made by putting this in \_execute. If they override it, they'd have to provide a default argument for it to do anything different.  ``` class SomeWebSocketHandler(WebSocketHandler):    def check_origin(self, allowed_origins=["localhost"]):       super(SomeWebSocketHandler, self).check_origin(allowed_origins)  ```  That's so ugly.  This is my first time hacking on Tornado, so I'm a bit lost on how to get to certain data and responses within the tests. In particular, I would want to verify the status code that was returned to the WebSocketClientConnection. Can you point me in the right direction so I can make better, more robust tests?  On a side note, I noticed that some of the tests aren't enabled (by way of the `gen_test` decorator). In particular, `test_websocket_callbacks` within websocket\_test. If enabled, it's a failing test (and completely unrelated to this PR). Is this by design? |

| Good catch on the test\_websocket\_callbacks bug - that wasn't intentional. I'll fix that and I think I've got a trick to detect and prevent these in the future.  For testing the error codes, you should be able to catch the HTTPError raised by websocket\_connect - see test\_websocket\_http\_fail.  It's not always possible for an application to pass in all its allowed origins (unless perhaps we introduce some sort of wildcard matching, but that just invites complexity), so I'd turn the interface around a bit: `_execute` calls `self.check_origin(origin)` with the value extracted from the headers (and perhaps normalized? lowercase it, add a port if it's missing, etc), and then it's up to check\_origin to decide whether to allow it. The default implementation would compute an expected origin from the request and compare to that, but applications are free to augment or replace that default. |

| For testing the error codes, you should be able to catch the HTTPError raised by websocket\_connect - see test\_websocket\_http\_fail.  Cool. That helped. Also made me realize I had the origin check in the wrong spot. Yay for tests.  ...with the value extracted from the headers (and perhaps normalized? lowercase it, add a port if it's missing, etc)  We won't actually know the port since origin is in the context of the browser. I can try to reach a websocket hosted on localhost using my javascript console while on `github.com` - the origin will show `http://github.com`.   ---   This is in a happy state now I think. Ready for comments or merging! |
