{
  "CVE-2014-3429": {
    "description": "The IPython Notebook server, in versions before 1.2, did not verify the origin of websocket requests. An attacker with knowledge of an IPython kernel ID could run arbitrary code on a user's machine with the privileges of the user running the IPython Notebook server, if the client visited a crafted malicious page.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The IPython Notebook server did not validate the origin of incoming WebSocket requests.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Origin WebSocket Hijacking",
        "Lack of origin verification for WebSocket connections."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with knowledge of a target user's IPython kernel ID could execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by making the victim visit a malicious web page. This code execution would occur with the privileges of the user running the IPython Notebook server.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious web page containing client-side JavaScript.",
         "WebSockets"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know an active IPython kernel ID. This may be obtained via social engineering or other means. The attacker must also be able to create a malicious web page."
    },
    "affected_versions": "IPython versions before 1.2, specifically 0.12 <= version < 1.2",
    "fixed_versions": [
      "IPython 1.2",
      "IPython 2.0.0"
    ],
     "fix_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by implementing origin verification for websocket requests. The server now checks if the origin of the request matches the host. This was achieved by adding a check_origin method in the WebSocketHandler which is enabled by default and can be overridden."
