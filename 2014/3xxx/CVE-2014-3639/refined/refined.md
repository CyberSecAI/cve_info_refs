Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-3639:

**Root Cause:**

The `dbus-daemon` allowed a limited number of incomplete connections (64 by default) before authentication. When this limit was reached, subsequent connections were dropped. A malicious process could exploit this by repeatedly attempting connections without completing authentication, causing legitimate connection attempts to fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient connection limiting:** The daemon did not properly handle a large number of incomplete connections, leading to denial of service.
*   **Authentication timeout too long:** The default authentication timeout was 30 seconds, allowing malicious connections to hold slots for an extended period.
*   **Lack of blocking for new connections:** When the limit of incomplete connections was reached, new connection attempts were dropped instead of being blocked, making it easier to cause denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact was denial of service. By exhausting the limited number of unauthenticated connection slots, an attacker could prevent legitimate processes from connecting to the D-Bus system message bus, disrupting system functionality.
*   **Slow connection at startup:** Even after applying fixes, a large number of malicious connections could still cause legitimate connections to be delayed, though not completely blocked.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector was local, requiring the attacker to run a malicious process on the same system as the vulnerable `dbus-daemon`.
*   **Repeated Connection Attempts:** The attacker would repeatedly initiate new connections to `dbus-daemon` but not complete the authentication handshake.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needed to be a local user on the system.
*   **Ability to create connections:** The attacker must be able to create new socket connections to the `dbus-daemon`.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability was mitigated by:

*   **Reducing the authentication timeout:** The default authentication timeout for the system bus was reduced from 30 seconds to 5 seconds.
*   **Blocking new connections:** When all unauthenticated connection slots are used up, new connection attempts are blocked instead of being disconnected.
*   **Pausing accept() calls:** `dbus-daemon` now stops accepting new connections when the maximum number of incomplete connections is reached and instead queues them in the kernel.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Alban Crequy.
*   The fix involves modifying `bus/bus.c` to stop listening for new connections when the `max_incomplete_connections` limit is reached, and starts listening again when the incomplete connections count falls below that limit.
*   The fix also requires a new internal API, `_dbus_server_toggle_all_watches`, to enable and disable all watches in a DBusServer.
