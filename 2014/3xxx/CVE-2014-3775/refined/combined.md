# USN-2215-1: libgadu vulnerability

21 May 2014

libgadu could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially
crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [libgadu](/security/cves?package=libgadu) - Gadu-Gadu protocol library

## Details

It was discovered that libgadu incorrectly handled certain messages from

file relay servers. A malicious remote server or a machine-in-the-middle could

use this issue to cause applications using libgadu to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Use CVE-2014-3775 for the issue as described in the 001180.html
message. It is possible that the 001171.html and 001180.html messages
are referring to exactly the same issue: in that case, there will be
only one CVE ID in total. (The messages are somewhat different -- for
example, 001180.html doesn't directly mention that exploitability is
unproven -- but this may be a wording difference and not anything
inherent about the code in 1.11.x versus 1.12 prereleases.)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libgadu: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201508-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in libgadu, the worst of
which may result in execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/libgadu** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.12.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.12.0** |

### Background

libgadu is a library that implements the client side of the Gadu-Gadu
protocol.

### Description

libgadu contains multiple vulnerabilities:

* X.509 certificates are not properly validated (CVE-2013-4488)
* A integer overflow error could lead to a buffer overflow
  (CVE-2013-6487)
* Malformed responses from a Gadu-Gadu file relay server are not
  properly handled (CVE-2014-3775)

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or spoof
servers.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libgadu users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/libgadu-1.12.0"

```

# USN-2216-1: Pidgin vulnerability

21 May 2014

Pidgin could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially
crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pidgin](/security/cves?package=pidgin) - graphical multi-protocol instant messaging client for X

## Details

It was discovered that Pidgin incorrectly handled certain messages from

Gadu-Gadu file relay servers. A malicious remote server or a

machine-in-the-middle could use this issue to cause Pidgin to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

| [Description](#c0)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:45:54 UTC  ``` Hi!  Please find attached an updated graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a configure in the tarball, so the ebuild might look a little funny because it uses autogen.sh instead of configure.  Besides the version update, the following was added:  1. Dependencies 2. conditional tcltk dependency (Not sure if this works for portage tcl-tk-8.3.3, as the portage version is broken.  It doesn't install private headers.  I submitted fixed tcl and tk ebuilds to this list previously, and it works with those)  3. Documentation  I have also attached a diff between the original and the new ebuild.  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:46:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 2](attachment.cgi?id=2 "graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=2&action=edit "graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild")] graphviz-1.7.15.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Tod M. Neidt    2002-01-04 02:47:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 3](attachment.cgi?id=3 "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=3&action=edit "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff"), [diff](attachment.cgi?id=3&action=diff "graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff")] graphviz-1.7.7-1.7.15.ebuild.diff ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Mikael Hallendal (hallski) (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-01-04 22:13:33 UTC  ``` commited, added depends on 25 too, so that I get notified when 25 is fixed. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
