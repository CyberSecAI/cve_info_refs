Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The ovirt-engine did not properly verify key attributes of X.509 certificates used by vdsm (Virtual Desktop Server Manager). Specifically, it failed to validate the attributes of the certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of certificate attributes. This allowed the system to trust certificates that should have been rejected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker could exploit this by presenting a spoofed SSL certificate. This forged certificate, with invalid attributes, could be accepted by the ovirt-engine, thus allowing the attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate communications.
*  **Spoofing:** The MitM attack allows the attacker to spoof a valid server to the client.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based MitM Attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the ovirt-engine and the vdsm, allowing them to intercept and modify network traffic.
*   **Spoofed Certificate:** The attacker has to generate or obtain a certificate that, while having invalid attributes, is still accepted by the ovirt-engine due to the insufficient validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to intercept network traffic, making them a man-in-the-middle.
*   **Certificate Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or acquire a certificate that has the required invalid attributes.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was rated as having "Moderate" security impact by Red Hat Product Security.
*   The bug report mentions that a future update might address the issue.
*   The bug was closed as "WONTFIX", indicating a decision not to address it in the reported versions.
