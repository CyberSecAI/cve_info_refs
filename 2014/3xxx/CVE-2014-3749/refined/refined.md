Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the Construtiva CIS Manager CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `email` parameter in the `/autenticar/lembrarlogin.asp` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The injection is error-based, meaning the attacker can infer information based on SQL error messages returned by the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database.
- This could lead to various impacts, including:
    - Data Breaches: Access to sensitive information stored in the database.
    - Data Modification: Modification or deletion of data.
    - Service Disruption: Potential denial of service by manipulating the database.
    - Privilege Escalation: In some cases, attackers might be able to escalate privileges through SQL injection if the underlying database user has the appropriate permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `/autenticar/lembrarlogin.asp` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `email` parameter within the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable URL, `/autenticar/lembrarlogin.asp`.
- No special privileges or access to the target system appear to be needed prior to exploitation.
- The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques.
