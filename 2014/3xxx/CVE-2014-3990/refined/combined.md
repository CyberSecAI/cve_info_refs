# [KIS-2014-08] OpenCart <= 1.5.6.4 (cart.php) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability

-----------------------------------------------------------------
OpenCart <= 1.5.6.4 (cart.php) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<http://www.opencart.com/>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 1.5.6.4 and prior versions.

[-] Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the "Cart::getProducts()" method defined in /system/library/cart.php:

23.             foreach ($this->session->data['cart'] as $key => $quantity) {
24.                     $product = explode(':', $key);
25.                     $product_id = $product[0];
26.                     $stock = true;
27.
28.                     // Options
29.                     if (!empty($product[1])) {
30.                             $options = unserialize(base64_decode($product[1]));
31.                     } else {
32.                             $options = array();
33.                     }

The vulnerability exists because this method uses the "unserialize()" function with the key values of the
array stored into the "data['cart']" session variable without a proper validation.  Such values might be
manipulated by an unauthenticated attacker via the $_POST['quantity'] parameter during an "update" request.
This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, and could allow an attacker
to conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by abusing the destructor method of the "DBMySQLi"
class and possibly other attacks leveraging magic methods of classes defined in third-party extensions.

NOTE: if OpenCart is running on PHP before version 5.3.23 or 5.4.13 this vulnerability
could also be exploited to carry out XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which in turn
might allow arbitrary command execution if the PHP "expect" extension is installed.

[-] Solution:

Update to version 1.5.6.5 when will be released or apply this patch: <http://git.io/F3dGoA>

[-] Disclosure Timeline:

[02/06/2014] - First attempt to contact the vendor
[04/06/2014] - Issue reported to <http://git.io/uOsKfA>
[06/06/2014] - CVE number requested
[06/06/2014] - CVE number assigned
[25/06/2014] - Vendor contacted again asking when will be released a fixed version
[25/06/2014] - Vendor replied there's no need to alert its users because the vulnerability is very weak
[14/07/2014] - Public disclosure

[-] CVE Reference:

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
has assigned the name CVE-2014-3990 to this vulnerability.

[-] Credits:

Vulnerability discovered by Egidio Romano.

Please create new release to include this patch, thank you. This is serious security vulnerability.

Object injection is a serious security vulnerability, but OSVDB description provides more information:

```
OpenCart contains a flaw in the Cart::getProducts() method in the cart.php that is triggered as input is not sanitized when passed via the 'quantity' parameter when handling update requests. This may allow a remote attacker to conduct a server side request forgery (SSRF) attack.

```

We've been getting responses from customers about strange emails containing viruses sent from the webshop email addresses. According to the description of SSRF attacks, this vulnerability would allow an attack to do exactly that.

I applied the patch and hope that this stops the sending of malware with a seemingly valid sender email. In any case I would also urge the OpenCart Team to create a new release containing this patch.

[@tyronx](https://github.com/tyronx) did the patch solved the problem with the strange emails containing viruses?

As I have same problem with strange emails I investigate the possibility that this vulnerability causes the problem.

In all OpenCart 1.5.6.5\_rc Versions, only the second mentioned FIX would be required in

the:

**public function update($key, $qty) {**

Section.

The other routine shown above does not exist anymore in 1.5.6.5\_rc OC Source.

This is a VqMod Section, to make it work at once:

```
<operation error="log">
<search position="replace" index="2"><![CDATA[if ((int)$qty && ((int)$qty > 0)) {]]></search>
<add><![CDATA[
if ((int)$qty && ((int)$qty > 0) && isset($this->session->data['cart'][$key])) {
]]></add>
</operation>

```

# OpenCart <= 1.5.6.4 (cart.php) PHP Object Injection Vulnerability

#### â¢ Software Link:

<http://www.opencart.com>

#### â¢ Affected Versions:

Version 1.5.6.4 and prior versions.

#### â¢ Vulnerability Description:

The vulnerable code is located in the `Cart::getProducts()` method defined in **/system/library/cart.php**:

```
23foreach ($this->session->data['cart'] as $key => $quantity) {
24    $product = explode(':', $key);
25    $product_id = $product[0];
26    $stock = true;
27
28    // Options
29    if (!empty($product[1])) {
30        $options = unserialize(base64_decode($product[1]));
31    } else {
32        $options = array();
33    }
```

The vulnerability exists because this method uses the `unserialize()` PHP function with the key values of the array stored into the **“data[cart]"** session variable without a proper validation. Such values might be manipulated by an unauthenticated attacker via the **$\_POST[‘quantity’]** parameter during an âupdateâ request. This can be exploited to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope, and could allow an attacker to conduct Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by abusing the destructor method of the `DBMySQLi` class and possibly other attacks leveraging magic methods of classes defined in third-party extensions.

NOTE: if OpenCart is running on PHP before version 5.3.23 or 5.4.13 this vulnerability could also be exploited to carry out XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which in turn might allow arbitrary command execution if the PHP âexpectâ extension is installed.
