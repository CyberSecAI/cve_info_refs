Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `unserialize()` function in the `Cart::getProducts()` method within `/system/library/cart.php` in OpenCart. This function is used on data taken directly from the `$_POST['quantity']` parameter without proper validation. The data is part of the `data['cart']` session variable, specifically the array keys which contain base64 encoded serialized data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The lack of validation before unserializing user-controlled input allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects into the application scope.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By injecting a crafted object, particularly one with a destructor method, like `DBMySQLi`, an attacker could force the server to make requests to arbitrary locations.
- **XML External Entity (XXE) attacks:** On PHP versions prior to 5.3.23 or 5.4.13, this vulnerability can be leveraged to perform XXE attacks which can lead to arbitrary command execution when the PHP "expect" extension is installed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Through SSRF or XXE, the attacker can gain arbitrary command execution on the server, especially when the PHP 'expect' extension is enabled along with older PHP versions.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery:** The attacker can use the server to perform requests to internal services or external systems, which can lead to further attacks or information disclosure.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can send malware through emails appearing to originate from the webshop.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive information or modify data within the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can manipulate the `$_POST['quantity']` parameter during an "update" request. This parameter controls the array keys of the session data, where serialized data is stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable OpenCart instance.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized PHP object, base64 encode it and include it in the  `$_POST['quantity']` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes details about the disclosure timeline, the patch and a discussion about the severity of the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in OpenCart versions 1.5.6.4 and prior.
- A patch for the vulnerability was provided, which adds a validation check when updating cart quantities.
- The vendor initially downplayed the severity of this vulnerability.
- The `unserialize` vulnerability allows for SSRF attacks by using the `DBMySQLi` class destructor.
