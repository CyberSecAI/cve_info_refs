Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the NextCellent Gallery 1.9.13 WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the presence of a persistent XSS vulnerability. This means that malicious scripts can be stored within the application's database or file system, and they will be executed whenever a user interacts with the affected functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser.
    *   Steal session cookies, allowing for account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
    * The vulnerability is in a WordPress plugin, making it a web-based attack vector.
    * The injection point is within the NextCellent Gallery plugin itself, likely in how it handles user inputs or data within the gallery features.
    * The XSS is persistent, meaning the malicious payload is stored somewhere (database or files) and executed each time a user accesses the affected content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript into the vulnerable plugin. This typically means the attacker can manipulate user-provided inputs.
    *   The attacker needs to target users who will access the stored malicious payload in the vulnerable part of the gallery plugin.
    *   An attacker could also leverage this as part of a broader attack if they can manipulate vulnerable admin-level fields.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The plugin has been closed due to security issues, and is no longer available for download. This suggests that the vulnerability was severe enough to warrant its removal from the WordPress plugin directory.
*   The provided text explicitly states the vulnerability is a "Persistent XSS," which provides more information than the generic CVE description.
*   The vulnerable version is specified as 1.9.13. This is useful for identification and remediation purposes.
