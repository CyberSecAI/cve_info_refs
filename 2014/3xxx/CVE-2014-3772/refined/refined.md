Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3772:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation of session variable checks meant to protect certain PHP files from direct execution. The application uses a session variable `CPM` to verify if a request is initiated through the main `index.php` file. However, the check is insufficient.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Session Variable Check:** The files that are intended to be protected check if the `$_SESSION['CPM']` variable is set and equals 1. However, these files do not check if a valid user session with a user ID and a key has also been created.
*   **Vulnerable Files:** Files that call `session_start()` before checking for the `CPM` variable are vulnerable.
*   **Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the intended protection by first accessing `index.php` (which sets `$_SESSION['CPM'] = 1`). Subsequently, they can directly access any of the vulnerable execution-protected files because `$_SESSION['CPM']` is set, even if they do not have a valid session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Direct File Access:** Attackers can directly access and execute files that are intended to be accessed only through the application's workflow.
*   **Sensitive Functionality Exposure:** This bypass exposes sensitive functionalities, such as the file upload facility in the described example.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Depending on the accessed file, this could lead to remote code execution.
*   **Login Bypass:** An attacker can potentially bypass login protections.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers can directly send HTTP requests to vulnerable files after accessing the `index.php` to set the `CPM` variable.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by remote unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required Initially:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
