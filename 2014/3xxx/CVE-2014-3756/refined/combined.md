-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Hi oss-security,

The Mumble team has just released Mumble 1.2.6, which contains fixes
for the two following vulnerabilities:

  Mumble-SA-2014-005  [<http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-005.txt>]
    - SVG images with local file references could trigger client DoS

  Mumble-SA-2014-006  [<http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-006.txt>]
    - The Mumble client did not properly HTML-escape some external strings
       before using them in a rich-text (HTML) context.

Prepend '.sig' to the advisory URLs for detached PGP signatures
(signed with my key).

We would also kindly request that CVEs be assigned for the above issues.

Thanks,
Mikkel Krautz on behalf of the Mumble Team

Mumble Security Advisory 2014-006
ID: Mumble-SA-2014-006
Date: May 2014
CVE Reference: Not assigned
Product: Mumble
Mumble Website: http://mumble.info
Permalink: http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-006.txt
Last Updated: 2014-05-14
1. Vulnerability
The Mumble client did not properly HTML-escape some external
strings before using them in a rich-text (HTML) context.
In some situations, this could be abused to perform a Denial of
Service attack (hang and/or resource exhaustion) on a Mumble
client by causing it to load external files via the HTML.
2. Affected versions and configurations
All 1.2.x versions of Mumble are affected.
3. Mitigation
No known mitigation strategies exist for this issue.
4. Details
By default, many Qt widgets sniff their text content to
determine whether or not to use to render the text as HTML.
However, in some places, the Mumble client neglected to
properly escape external strings when used rich-text enabled
Qt widgets.
One case where this was an issue was when including user
and channel names in Qt dialogs. However, this vector is
automatically mitigated if using the default channel- and
username regular expressions, since angle brackets are
disallowed by it.
Another case where this issue could be triggered was in the
Certificate Wizard, where the subject common name and emai
addresses were not properly escaped.
A similar problem exists with the tooltip for servers in
the Mumble server list, where the server name was not
properly escaped.
While finding and fixing the above issues, any other
instances where an explicit HTML-escape was deemed
appropriate had one inserted.
In some cases, instead of performing explicit HTML
escapes, Qt widgets that were determined not to ever
contain HTML content were changed to only be able to
render plain text.
5. Credits
This issue was originally fixed in the Mumble git repo
by various commits from Tim Cooper and Mikkel Krautz.
6. Fix
A fix for this issue has been released in Mumble 1.2.6.
A patch that applies on top of Mumble 1.2.5 can be found at
http://mumble.info/security/Mumble-SA-2014-006.patch
(for a detached PGP signature, append '.sig').
The fix is also available in the Mumble git repo as
e30d7acda6c04b667618ac86f49786cf966a08fb (on the v1.2.6 branch).
