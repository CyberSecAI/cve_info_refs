# Security Bulletin: Brute-force attack in ClearQuest Web (CVE-2014-3101)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Rational ClearQuest Web is vulnerable to brute-force attack.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2014-3101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3101)

## Affected Products and Versions

| **ClearQuest version** | **Status** |
| --- | --- |
| 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.4 | Affected |
| 8.0 through 8.0.0.11 | Affected |
| 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.14 | Affected |
| 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x (all versions and fix packs) | Affected |

## Remediation/Fixes

Customers have been able to choose to use LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) with a password policy (lock out the account after several login failures) to prevent brute-force attacks specifically for LDAP authenticated CQ accounts. Customers can implement this on any version of ClearQuest with LDAP authenticated user accounts. However, not all accounts are typically LDAP-enabled.

As of [ClearQuest Fix Pack 6 (8.0.1.6) for 8.0.1](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038912), a built-in mechanism for brute-force protection is available that includes account lock outs. It must be configured and enabled against a Feature Level 9 upgraded database for it to take effect. For more information about this new protection feature, see [How to protect your ClearQuest deployment from brute-force password attacks](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27044431).

**\***For ClearQuest 8.0.1.5, 8.0.0.12, 7.1.2.15 and newer, a one second delay is added after the login failure. This is intended to assist in delaying an attacker while giving the ClearQuest administrator more time to detect the attack and take action. This delay cannot completely prevent a brute-force attack, and **customers are strongly recommended to upgrade to ClearQuest 8.0.1.6 with database Feature Level 9, or newer so they can configure and use the built-in brute-force protection**. Customers must make their own determination as to the risk any security vulnerability applies to their business organization's environment and tolerance levels.

Note: ClearQuest database Feature Level upgrades have the benefit of permanently blocking earlier product versions that do not support that Feature Level. To obtain a list of supported Feature Levels in your client, run the installutil showfeaturelevels command.

Additional enhancements have been provided, by upgrading to one of the following releases or higher:

| **Affected Versions** | **Applying the fix** | **Enhacement provided:** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8.0.1.x | Install [Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 6 (8.0.1.6) for 8.0.1](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038912) | * 1 second delay as deterrent.\* * [Built-in brute-force prevention when configured](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27044431) (requires database Feature Level 9). |
| 8.0.0.x | Install [Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 12 (8.0.0.12) for 8.0](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038191) | * 1 second delay as deterrent.\* |
| 7.1.2.x | Install [Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 15 (7.1.2.15) for 7.1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038192) | * 1 second delay as deterrent.\* |
| 7.1.1.x | Install [Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 15 (7.1.2.15) for 7.1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038192)**Note:** 7.1.2.15 inter-operates with all 7.1.1.x systems and can be installed in the same way as 7.1.1.x fix packs. | * 1 second delay as deterrent.\* |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

See above regarding usage of LDAP with a lockout password policy for LDAP-enabled CQ user accounts. This will not protect CQ user accounts that are not LDAP-enabled.

## Internal Use Only

PSIRT # 1858 RECORD # 39773
 The current solution was agreed by Security team as an improvement for all our streams. The total solution is too complex to be delivered to all the streams. The total solution will only be delivered to 8.0.1.x stream in 2014D.

 Note: Originally we told customers to upgrade to [Rational ClearQuest Fix Pack 5 (8.0.1.5) for 8.0.1](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038190) which had the same delay added to it. Now we tell customers to upgrade to 8.0.1.6 which has built-in brute-force protection.
