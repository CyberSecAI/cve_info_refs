*   **Web Browser:** The attack targets the web browser of users accessing the vulnerable ServerView Operations Manager.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation does not require prior authentication to the application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to inject the malicious script in a vulnerable parameter, potentially through manipulating input fields or URLs that the application fails to sanitize or escape correctly.
    *   The specific injection point is not provided in the documents, but the general vulnerability type is.
*   **Network Access**: The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable service via a network.
