Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-3025

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the webclient/utility/*.jsp files of several IBM products. This indicates a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input before including it in dynamically generated web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
- This allows attackers to potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- It can also be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as modifying data or performing unauthorized transactions.
- Attackers could potentially redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through web requests to the affected JSP pages.
- Attackers inject malicious scripts through input fields or parameters that are not properly sanitized.
- The malicious script is then executed when the affected page is viewed by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers must be able to craft a malicious request.
- They must be able to send a request to the vulnerable JSP pages with malicious script.
- No special privileges or access is mentioned, but typically XSS attacks can be exploited by any user that is able to send a web request to the vulnerable server.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
The following IBM products are affected:
- Maximo Asset Management 7.5, 7.1, 6.2 (and related products/versions such as Essentials, Government, Nuclear Power, Transportation, Life Sciences, Oil and Gas, and Utilities)
- SmartCloud Control Desk 7.5
- Tivoli Asset Management for IT 7.2, 7.1, 6.2
- Tivoli Service Request Manager 7.2, 7.1, Maximo Service Desk 6.2
- Change and Configuration Management Database 7.2, 7.1

**Remediation:**
- Apply the appropriate interim fix or fix pack from IBM's Fix Central.
- Specific fixes for each affected product version are available via the provided links or by contacting IBM support.

**Workarounds:**
- Until the patches are applied, network protocols could be restricted to potentially reduce the risk of successful attacks.
- User privileges for specific packages could be removed.
- IBM strongly recommends testing changes on non-production systems.
- Workarounds should not be considered a long-term solution.
