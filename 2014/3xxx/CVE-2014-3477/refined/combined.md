# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c0)  Daniel Stone    2014-05-20 17:12:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 99433](attachment.cgi?id=99433 "resolve the error") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=99433&action=edit "resolve the error") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=78979&attachment=99433) resolve the error  How it should work:  When a D-Bus message activates a service, LSMs (SELinux or AppArmor) check whether the message can be delivered after the service has been activated. The service is considered activated when its well-known name is requested with org.freedesktop.DBus.RequestName. When the message delivery is denied, the service stays activated but should not receive the activating message (the message which triggered the activation). dbus-daemon is supposed to drop the activating message and reply to the sender with a D-Bus error message.  However, it does not work as expected:  1. The error message is delivered to the service instead of being delivered to    the sender. As an example, the error message could be something like:       An SELinux policy prevents this sender from sending this      message to this recipient, [...] member="MaliciousMethod"     So the sender could maliciously leak information to the service by inserting    the information in the member name, even though the LSM attempted to block    the communication between the sender and the service.  2. The error message is delivered as a reply to the RequestName call from    service. It means the activated service will believe it cannot request the    name and might exit. The sender could activate the service frequently and    systemd will give up activating it. Thus the denial of service.  The attached patch fixes the bug in my test. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c1)  Daniel Stone    2014-05-20 17:13:39 UTC  ``` (Filed on behalf of Alban as he couldn't restrict it to security-only. I don't know the first thing about it, and didn't even read what I copy and pasted.) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c2)  Alban Crequy    2014-05-23 17:25:48 UTC  ``` This bug is not specific to LSMs (SELinux or AppArmor): I manage to trigger it with a D-Bus security policy alone.  My test is the following:  /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1.conf:  <!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC  "-//freedesktop//DTD D-BUS Bus Configuration 1.0//EN"  "<http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd>"> <busconfig>   <policy user="rtkit">     <allow own="org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1"/>   </policy>   <policy user="root">     <allow own="org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1"/>   </policy>   <policy context="default">     <!-- XXX: I replaced "allow" by "deny" here for my test! -->     <deny send_destination="org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1"/>   </policy>   <policy user="root">     <allow send_destination="org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1"/>     <allow receive_sender="org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1"/>   </policy> </busconfig>  For the purpose of the test, I forbid non-root processes (such as pulseaudio) to deliver a message to rtkit. Then, when starting pulseaudio, it attempts to send a message to rtkit: the message is not delivered (that's ok, that's what I wanted) but rtkit couldn't request its well-known name (that's not ok, that's a denial of service):  rtkit-daemon[1167]: Failed to register name on bus: Rejected send message, 2 matched rules; type="method_call", sender=":1.59" (uid=1000 pid=1093 comm="/usr/bin/pulseaudio --start --log-target=syslog ") interface="org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1" member="MakeThreadRealtime" error name="(unset)" requested_reply="0" destination="org.freedesktop.RealtimeKit1" (uid=0 pid=1167 comm="/usr/lib/rtkit/rtkit-daemon ")  When rtkit-daemon calls RequestName(), it receives the signal "NameAcquired" successfully but RequestName() returns the D-Bus error message above that should have been delivered to Pulseaudio, and it does not receive the real D-Bus reply. So rtkit believes it failed to claim its well-known name and exits.  The patch works by sending the D-Bus error message to pulseaudio immediately in a different context (using local variables "sub_transaction" and "tmp_error") instead of hijacking the context of RequestName (parameters "transaction" and "error"). ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c3)  Simon McVittie    2014-05-26 09:19:37 UTC  ``` Adding de facto D-Bus security contacts to Cc ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c4)  Simon McVittie    2014-05-26 09:25:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c0)) > 1.

I do not consider this sort of compartmentalization to be something that D-Bus should claim to support - it isn't something we test, and isn't necessary for mainstream Linux. In my view, if you have a mixture of "normal" and "top secret" processes and you want it to be impossible for the "top secret" processes to leak information to the "normal" processes, you should be using virtual machines or containers. However, if fans of SELinux do want it, they are welcome to help support it.  So I don't consider (1) to be a vulnerability, as such...  > 2.

Thus the denial of service.  ... but (2) is certainly a denial-of-service vulnerability, so this is worth addressing. I'll try to do a detailed review on this soon. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c5)  Thiago Macieira    2014-05-26 16:33:57 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c4)) > (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c0)) > > 1.

I don't see how this is leaking any information. You get an error message saying the message you sent was rejected, with some of the details of the message you sent. That is, the malicious sender already knew about "MaliciousMethod" in order to send a call to that method.  Once we fix the destination of the error message, the problem is gone. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c6)  Alban Crequy    2014-05-26 17:20:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c5)) > (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c4)) > > (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c0)) > > > 1.

It can only leak information if the sender and the service are malicious confederates and agree on a protocol to leak the information, e.g. base64 the secret information and insert the result in the "member" field of the D-Bus message.  > Once we fix the destination of the error message, the problem is gone.  I agree. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c7)  Simon McVittie    2014-05-30 15:37:13 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 99433](attachment.cgi?id=99433 "resolve the error") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=99433&action=edit "resolve the error") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=78979&attachment=99433) resolve the error  Review of [attachment 99433](attachment.cgi?id=99433 "resolve the error") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=99433&action=edit "resolve the error") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=78979&attachment=99433): -----------------------------------------------------------------  Code review: looks correct, but could be simpler.  ::: bus/activation.c @@ +1203,5 @@ >                                       addressed_recipient, > +                                     entry->activation_message, &tmp_error)) > +            { > +              if (!bus_transaction_send_error_reply (sub_transaction, entry->connection, > +                                                     &tmp_error, entry->activation_message))  (As a side note, that function is confusingly-named: it does not actually send anything.

That's correct if the error is OOM, but not correct if the intention was to send the error back to the process that originally requested activation instead.  So the function at least deserves a comment  /* Any DBusError raised here will make the RequestName call fail with that error,  * so do not return a DBusError unless the whole transaction has failed. */  I'm tempted to say it should not have a DBusError parameter at all, so it's more clearly an example of the "return TRUE, or FALSE on OOM" pattern (and its only caller would have to set the OOM error instead).  In addition to fixing that, you're introducing slightly more complex transactions. Your code essentially reads: if there is not enough memory to send the error message(s) to each client that was not allowed to talk to the service, send OOM to the client(s) that hit OOM instead, and ignore those OOMs for the purposes of deciding whether RequestName() was successful or needs to be rolled back.  Not using the sub-transaction, and just using @transaction, would instead result in: if there is not enough memory to send the error message(s) to each client that was not allowed to talk to the service, RequestName() fails with OOM; the service may retry, or just exit (which is theoretically DoS I suppose, but if you're hitting OOM in dbus-daemon then your system is already being denied service).  This is all pretty theoretical - dbus-daemon shouldn't OOM under any normal circumstance - so I'm tempted to ask for the simpler version. Alban, would you mind implementing and testing that simpler version, and we can decide which is better when we can compare both patches? ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c8)  Simon McVittie    2014-05-30 15:39:57 UTC  ``` Proposed advisory text:  ----8<---- D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other operating systems.  Alban Crequy discovered a denial-of-service flaw in the reference implementation of dbus-daemon, the D-Bus message bus daemon. Additionally, in highly unusual environments the same flaw could lead to a side channel between processes that should not be able to communicate.  Summary:  If a client C1 is prohibited from sending a message to a service S1, and S1 is not currently running, then C1 can attempt to send a message to S1's well-known bus name, causing dbus-daemon to start S1 [1]. When S1 has started and obtained its well-known bus name, the dbus-daemon evaluates its security policy, decides that it will not deliver the message to S1, and constructs an AccessDenied error. However, instead of sending that AccessDenied error reply to C1 as a reply to the denied message, dbus-daemon incorrectly sends it to S1 as a reply to the request to obtain its well-known bus name.  Impact 1: denial of service. S1 will fail to initialize, and exit, denying service to legitimate clients of S1.  Impact 2: in environments where C1 and S1 are untrusted and are administratively prohibited from communicating, S1 could also use these incorrectly-directed error messages as a side channel to receive information from C1.  Mitigations:  Impact 1: if a legitimate client was actively using S1, S1 would already have been started, so C1 can only deny service to a legitimate client that only recently became active.  Impact 2: in practice processes sharing a system bus can typically communicate in other ways (non-D-Bus IPC mechanisms, files in /tmp, etc.), so impact 2 is not relevant on normal systems. It might be relevant on systems when an LSM such as SELinux is used in a highly restrictive configuration.  Footnotes:  [1] This is perhaps unexpected, but the dbus-daemon is behaving as designed: it cannot necessarily evaluate which security policies it should apply to S1 until S1 has actually connected back to dbus-daemon, because S1 might change its uid, SELinux context, etc. during startup. The conceptual model is that activatable services are always running, and that the dbus-daemon delaying their startup until they are actually needed is a form of lazy evaluation. As such, the D-Bus maintainers do not consider this to be a bug or vulnerability. ----8<---- ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=78979#c9)  Alban Crequy    2014-06-02 10:48:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 100282](attachment.cgi?id=100282 "[PATCH v2] security and activation: deliver error messages correctly and fix Denial of Service") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=100282&action=edit "[PATCH v2] security and activation: deliver error messages correctly and fix Denial of Service") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=78979&attachment=100282) [PATCH v2] security and activation: deliver error messages correctly and fix Denial of Service  patch updated after smcv's review: - prototype changed to remove the error parameter and let the caller set the OOM error if it retuns FALSE. - do not use subtransaction but the same transaction. - do not cancel, execute or free the transaction: let the caller do it.

# CVE-2014-3477 (fd.o#78979): local DoS in dbus-daemon

---

*From*: Simon McVittie <simon.mcvittie () collabora co uk>

*Date*: Tue, 10 Jun 2014 18:28:52 +0100

```
D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an
asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used
for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other
operating systems.

Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed a denial-of-service
flaw in dbus-daemon, part of the reference implementation of D-Bus.
Additionally, in highly unusual environments the same flaw could lead to
a side channel between processes that should not be able to communicate.

On the stable branch, this is fixed in version 1.8.4:
<http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.8.4.tar.gz>
<http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.8.4.tar.gz.asc>

On the previous stable branch, this is fixed in version 1.6.20:
<http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.6.20.tar.gz>
<http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/dbus-1.6.20.tar.gz.asc>

Distributions supporting other versions should base their changes on
this commit:
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/commit/?h=dbus-1.8&id=24c590703ca47eb71ddef453de43126b90954567>

Summary:

If a client C1 is prohibited from sending a message to a service S1, and
S1 is not currently running, then C1 can attempt to send a message to
S1's well-known bus name, causing dbus-daemon to start S1 [1]. When S1
has started and obtained its well-known bus name, the dbus-daemon
evaluates its security policy, decides that it will not deliver the
message to S1, and constructs an AccessDenied error. However, instead of
sending that AccessDenied error reply to C1 as a reply to the denied
message, dbus-daemon incorrectly sends it to S1 as a reply to the
request to obtain its well-known bus name.

Impact A: denial of service. S1 will fail to initialize, and exit,
denying service to legitimate clients of S1.

Impact B: side channel. In environments where C1 and S1 are untrusted
and are administratively prohibited from communicating, S1 could also
use these incorrectly-directed error messages as a side channel to
receive information from C1.

Mitigations:

Impact A: if a legitimate client was actively using S1, S1 would already
have been started, so C1 can only deny service to a legitimate client
that only recently became active.

Impact B: in practice processes sharing a system bus can typically
communicate in other ways (non-D-Bus IPC mechanisms, files in /tmp,
etc.), so impact B is not relevant on normal systems. It might be
relevant on systems when an LSM such as SELinux is used in a highly
restrictive configuration.

Footnotes:

[1] This is perhaps unexpected, but the dbus-daemon is behaving as
designed: it cannot necessarily evaluate which security policies it
should apply to S1 until S1 has actually connected back to dbus-daemon,
because S1 might change its uid, SELinux context, etc. during startup.
The conceptual model is that activatable services are always running,
and that the dbus-daemon delaying their startup until they are actually
needed is a form of lazy evaluation. As such, the D-Bus maintainers do
not consider this to be a bug or vulnerability.

```

openSUSE Security Update: dbus-1: update to 1.6.24
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1239-1
Rating: moderate
References: #896453
Cross-References: CVE-2014-3635 CVE-2014-3636 CVE-2014-3637
CVE-2014-3638 CVE-2014-3639
Affected Products:
openSUSE 12.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The DBUS-1 service and libraries were updated to upstream release 1.6.24
fixing security issues and bugs.
Upstream changes since dbus 1.6.8
+ Security fixes
- Do not accept an extra fd in the padding of a cmsg message, which
could lead to a 4-byte heap buffer overrun. (CVE-2014-3635,
fdo#83622; Simon McVittie)
- Reduce default for maximum Unix file descriptors passed per message
from 1024 to 16, preventing a uid with the default maximum number of
connections from exhausting the system bus' file descriptors under
Linux's default rlimit. Distributors or system administrators with a
more restrictive fd limit may wish to reduce these limits further.
Additionally, on Linux this prevents a second denial of service in
which the dbus-daemon can be made to exceed the maximum number of
fds per sendmsg() and disconnect the process that would have
received them. (CVE-2014-3636, fdo#82820; Alban Crequy)
- Disconnect connections that still have a fd pending unmarshalling
after a new configurable limit, pending\_fd\_timeout (defaulting to
150 seconds), removing the possibility of creating an abusive
connection that cannot be disconnected by setting up a circular
reference to a connection's file descriptor. (CVE-2014-3637,
fdo#80559; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for maximum pending replies per connection from 8192
to 128, mitigating an algorithmic complexity denial-of-service
attack (CVE-2014-3638, fdo#81053; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for authentication timeout on the system bus from 30
seconds to 5 seconds, avoiding denial of service by using up all
unauthenticated connection slots; and when all unauthenticated
connection slots are used up, make new connection attempts block
instead of disconnecting them. (CVE-2014-3639, fdo#80919; Alban
Crequy)
- On Linux >= 2.6.37-rc4, if sendmsg() fails with ETOOMANYREFS,
silently drop the message. This prevents an attack in which a
malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a system service,
which is a local denial of service. (fdo#80163, CVE-2014-3532; Alban
Crequy)
- Track remaining Unix file descriptors correctly when more than one
message in quick succession contains fds. This prevents another
attack which a malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a
system service. (fdo#79694, fdo#80469, CVE-2014-3533; Alejandro
Martínez Suárez, Simon McVittie, Alban Crequy)
- Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed a
denial-of-service flaw in dbus-daemon, part of the reference
implementation of D-Bus. Additionally, in highly unusual
environments the same flaw could lead to a side channel between
processes that should not be able to communicate. (CVE-2014-3477,
fdo#78979)
- CVE-2013-2168: Fix misuse of va\_list that could be used as a denial
of service for system services. Vulnerability reported by Alexandru
Cornea. (Simon)
+ Other fixes
- Don't leak memory on out-of-memory while listing activatable or
active services (fdo#71526, Radoslaw Pajak)
- fix undefined behaviour in a regression test (fdo#69924, DreamNik)
- path\_namespace='/' in match rules incorrectly matched nothing; it
now matches everything. (fdo#70799, Simon McVittie)
- Make dbus\_connection\_set\_route\_peer\_messages(x, FALSE) behave as
documented. Previously, it assumed its second parameter was TRUE.
(fdo#69165, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a NULL pointer dereference on an unlikely error path (fdo#69327,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- If accept4() fails with EINVAL, as it can on older Linux kernels
with newer glibc, try accept() instead of going into a busy-loop.
(fdo#69026, Chengwei Yang)
- If socket() or socketpair() fails with EINVAL or EPROTOTYPE, for
instance on Hurd or older Linux with a new glibc, try without
SOCK\_CLOEXEC. (fdo#69073; Pino Toscano, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a file descriptor leak on an error code path. (fdo#69182,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- Fix compilation if writev() is unavailable (fdo#69409, Vasiliy
Balyasnyy)
- Avoid an infinite busy-loop if a signal interrupts waitpid()
(fdo#68945, Simon McVittie)
- Escape addresses containing non-ASCII characters correctly
(fdo#53499, Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in \_dbus\_string\_init() or similar, don't
free an invalid pointer if the string is later freed (fdo#65959,
Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in dbus\_set\_error(), don't va\_end() a
va\_list that was never va\_start()ed (fdo#66300, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a regression test on platforms with strict alignment (fdo#67279,
Colin Walters)
- Avoid calling function parameters "interface" since certain Windows
headers have a namespace-polluting macro of that name (fdo#66493,
Ivan Romanov)
- Make "make -j check" work (fdo#68852, Simon McVittie)
- In dbus-daemon, don't crash if a .service file starts with key=value
(fdo#60853, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix an assertion failure if we try to activate systemd services
before systemd connects to the bus (fdo#50199, Chengwei Yang)
- Avoid compiler warnings for ignoring the return from write()
(Chengwei Yang)
- Following Unicode Corrigendum #9, the noncharacters U+nFFFE,
U+nFFFF, U+FDD0..U+FDEF are allowed in UTF-8 strings again.
(fdo#63072, Simon McVittie)
- Diagnose incorrect use of dbus\_connection\_get\_data() with negative
slot (i.e. before allocating the slot) rather than returning junk
(fdo#63127, Dan Williams)
- In the activation helper, when compiled for tests, do not reset the
system bus address, fixing the regression tests. (fdo#52202, Simon)
- Fix building with Valgrind 3.8, at the cost of causing harmless
warnings with Valgrind 3.6 on some compilers (fdo#55932, Arun
Raghavan)
- Don't leak temporary fds pointing to /dev/null (fdo#56927, Michel
HERMIER)
- Create session.d, system.d directories under CMake (fdo#41319, Ralf
Habacker)
- Include alloca.h for alloca() if available, fixing compilation on
Solaris 10 (fdo#63071, Dagobert Michelsen)

When a D-Bus message activates a service, LSMs (SELinux or AppArmor) check
whether the message can be delivered after the service has been activated. The
service is considered activated when its well-known name is requested with
org.freedesktop.DBus.RequestName. When the message delivery is denied, the
service stays activated but should not receive the activating message (the
message which triggered the activation). dbus-daemon is supposed to drop the
activating message and reply to the sender with a D-Bus error message.
However, it does not work as expected:
1. The error message is delivered to the service instead of being delivered to
the sender. As an example, the error message could be something like:
An SELinux policy prevents this sender from sending this
message to this recipient, [...] member="MaliciousMethod"
If the sender and the service are malicious confederates and agree on a
protocol to insert information in the member name, the sender can leak
information to the service, even though the LSM attempted to block the
communication between the sender and the service.
2. The error message is delivered as a reply to the RequestName call from
service. It means the activated service will believe it cannot request the
name and might exit. The sender could activate the service frequently and
systemd will give up activating it. Thus the denial of service.
The following changes fix the bug:
- bus\_activation\_send\_pending\_auto\_activation\_messages() only returns an error
in case of OOM. The prototype is changed to return TRUE, or FALSE on OOM
(and its only caller sets the OOM error).
- When a client is not allowed to talk to the service, a D-Bus error message
is pre-allocated to be delivered to the client as part of the transaction.
The error is not propagated to the caller so RequestName will not fail
(except on OOM).

Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3477 CVE-2014-3532 CVE-2014-3533

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in dbus, an asynchronous
inter-process communication system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-3477

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered that dbus-daemon sends an
    AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the
    client is prohibited from accessing the service. A local attacker
    could use this flaw to cause a bus-activated service that is not
    currently running to attempt to start, and fail, denying other users
    access to this service.

CVE-2014-3532

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's
    support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force
    system services or user applications to be disconnected from the
    D-Bus system by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,
    leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2014-3533

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. and Alejandro Martinez Suarez
    discovered that a malicious process could force services to be
    disconnected from the D-Bus system by causing dbus-daemon to attempt
    to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process, leading to
    a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
