Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2014-3995:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `gravatar` template tag in Djblets did not properly escape the display name of a user when generating the HTML for a gravatar image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page by crafting a malicious display name. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Stealing user credentials

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker changes their display name to include malicious JavaScript code, such as `"></script><script>alert(1);</script><"`.
- When a page renders the gravatar image of the user, the unescaped display name is included in the HTML `alt` attribute, which closes the `<img>` tag and executes the injected JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user of the affected system where they can change their display name.
- The attacker's gravatar must be displayed on a page.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Christian Hammond of Bean Bag, Inc.
- The fix involves using Django's `format_html()` function to ensure safe escaping of the user's display name.
- The issue affects python-djblets versions 0.8.2-1.fc21 and 0.7.29-1.fc20.
- Patches were released for both Djblets 0.7.x and 0.8.x branches to address the vulnerability.
