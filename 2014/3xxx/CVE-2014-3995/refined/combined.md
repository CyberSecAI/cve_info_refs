How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
The generated gravatar HTML wasn't handling escaping of the display name
of the user, allowing an attacker to choose a name that would close out
the <img> tag and inject a <script> tag.

By switching to Django's format_html(), we can guarantee safe escaping
of content.
```

(There are two CVE IDs because of the two discoverers.)

# Requesting CVEs issued for two XSS vulnerabilities in Djblets (a set of Django helpers)

Hash: SHA1

== XSS Vulnerability in Djblets json_dumps() ==
Description of problem:

Django's JSON serialization does not handle escaping of any characters
to make them safe for injecting into HTML. This allows an attacker who
can provide part of a JSON-serializable object to craft a string that
can break out of a <script> tag and create its own, injecting a custom
script.

To fix this, we escape '<', '>', and '&' characters in the resulting
string, preventing a </script> from executing.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
python-djblets-0.8.2-1.fc21
python-djblets-0.7.29-1.fc20

How reproducible:
Every time

Steps to Reproduce:
1. User can change their display name to "</script><script>
alert(1)</script>"
2. Browse a page where this user was the submitter

Actual results:
Script is executed

Expected results:
User's name should be sanitized

Additional info:
Issue is public, due to it having been reported on upstream's public
bug tracker.

Upstream bug report:
<https://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/issues/detail?id=3406>

Upstream patch:
Djblets 0.7.x: <https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/5944/diff>
Djblets 0.8.x: <https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/5945/diff>

I do not yet have the real name of the reporter to credit.

== XSS Vulnerability in Djblets gravatar templates ==
Description of problem:
The generated gravatar HTML wasn't handling escaping of the display name
of the user, allowing an attacker to choose a name that would close out
the <img> tag and inject a <script> tag.

By switching to Django's format_html(), we can guarantee safe escaping
of content.

Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):
python-djblets-0.8.2-1.fc21
python-djblets-0.7.29-1.fc20

How reproducible:
Every time

Steps to Reproduce:
1. User can change their display name to "</script><script>
alert(1)</script>"
2. Configure this user for a Gravatar image
3. Browse to any page displaying the gravatar image

Actual results:
The script executes

Expected results:
The username should be properly sanitized and prevent XSS execution.

Additional info:
Issue is public now as the fix has now been committed to upstream git.

Credit for the discovery of this vulnerability should be given to
Christian Hammond of Bean Bag, Inc. (author of Review Board).

This issue is present in the python-djblets package on Fedora 19, 20,
Rawhide and EPEL 6 (EPEL 7 has not yet had a successful build).

Upstream patch:
Djblets 0.7.x: <https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/5947/diff/>
Djblets 0.8.x: <https://reviews.reviewboard.org/r/5946/diff/>
