## Topic

Updated java-1.6.0-ibm packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Satellite 5.6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

This update corrects several security vulnerabilities in the IBM Java
Runtime Environment shipped as part of Red Hat Satellite 5.6. In a typical
operating environment, these are of low security risk as the runtime is not
used on untrusted applets.

Several flaws were fixed in the IBM Java 2 Runtime Environment.
