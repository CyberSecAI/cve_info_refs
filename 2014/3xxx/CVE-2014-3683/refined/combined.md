Subject: sysklogd vulnerability (CVE-2014-3634)

Vendors et al.

Many thanks to Rainer Gerhards, rsyslog project lead, for identifying a
problem with how rsyslog's rsyslogd and sysklogd's syslogd check for
invalid priority values (CVE-2014-3634). For details please refer to
Rainer's well-written issue description. [1]

In sysklogd's syslogd, invalid priority values between 192 and 1023
(directly or arrived at via overflow wraparound) can propagate through
code causing out-of-bounds access to the f_pmask array within the
'filed' structure by up to 104 bytes past its end. Though most likely
insufficient to reach unallocated memory because there are around 544
bytes past f_pmask in 'filed' (mod packing and other differences),
incorrect access of fields at higher positions of the 'filed' structure
definition can cause unexpected behavior including message
mis-classification, forwarding issues, message loss, or other.

I've been unable to contact sysklogd's maintainer (the project is no
longer active) but, given some vendors ship sysklogd as their system
logging daemon, it was important to share a fix.

Fix for sysklogd 1.5 is available at:
<http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5_CVE-2014-3634.diff>

Note: publication of this patch was intentionally delayed to afford the
rsyslog project time to correct their initial fix set which was
vulnerable to integer overflows (CVE-2014-3683). [2]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# rsyslog

## [Encasing of control structures](https://www.rsyslog.com/encasing-of-control-structures/)

  By [friedl](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/friedl/)Posted on [October 28, 2019](https://www.rsyslog.com/encasing-of-control-structures/)Posted in [FAQ](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/faq/)Tagged [faq](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/faq/), [filter](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/filter/), [if filter](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/if-filter/), [if then](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/if-then/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/)

When using control structures to create some case filtering, there are some things to consider when formatting this.

In general, a control structure can be as simple as this:

```
if $msg contains "word" then
    action()
else
    action()
```

While this is correct and will work as expected, it is generally better style to encase expressions and actions. That way, they are more clearly separated from the control structure itself for better overview and can be more easily expanded without error. When using multiple actions or expressions, encasing is needed anyway, so we think it’s good practice to always use it.

Example:

```
if ($msg contains "word") then {
    action()
} else {
    action()
}
```

And a more complex example:

```
if ($msg contains "word" and $source == "123.123.123.123") then {
    action()
    action()
} else {
    action()
    action()
}
```

All three sample snippets above are correct in their own way. Added complexity makes encasing necessary though. So, you may as well use it for all your filters to have a consistent and all-case proof configuration.

## [rsyslog 8.34.0 (v8-stable) released](https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-8-34-0-v8-stable-released/)

  By [friedl](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/friedl/)Posted on [April 3, 2018](https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-8-34-0-v8-stable-released/)Posted in [News](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/news/), [Release Announcement](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/news/release-announcement/), [Uncategorized](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/uncategorized/)Tagged [8.34.0](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/8-34-0/), [bugfix](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/bugfix/), [imfile](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/imfile/), [mmkubernetes](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/mmkubernetes/), [release](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/release/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/)

**Today, we release rsyslog 8.34.0.** Most notably is the large refactoring of the imfile module as well as the new module mmkubernetes (contributed). Additionaly, a lot of improvements and fixes have been added to the current release, too many to list them all. So please take a look at the changelog for all the details.

## [rsyslog 8.33.1 (v8-stable) released](https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-8-33-1-v8-stable-released/)

**Today, we release rsyslog 8.33.1.** The 8.33.0 tarball release was actually pre-8.33.0. Thus it did not contain all features. This alone made a re-release
 necessary.

**Today, we release rsyslog 8.33.0.** This release has a number of changes, but most of these are under the hood. Some of the more obivous changes are the new include() script object and template json container. Also, rsyslog now has better support for running in a container environment. The full list of changes to rsyslog can be reviewed in the Changelog.

## [rsyslog 8.32.0 (v8-stable) released](https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-8-32-0-v8-stable-released/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [January 9, 2018](https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-8-32-0-v8-stable-released/)Posted in [News](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/news/), [Release Announcement](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/news/release-announcement/)Tagged [8.32.0](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/8-32-0/), [bugfix](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/bugfix/), [release](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/release/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [stable](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/stable/), [v8](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/v8/)

**Today, we release rsyslog 8.32.0.** This realease, again, sports a vast number of changes. E.g. there are a number of new or updated build requirements, namely: libfastjson 0.99.8, libczmq >= 3.0.2 and libcurl. Otherwise most notably is the major update that ompgsql has received through contribution. Other changes include modules like pmrfc3164, omhiredis, mmexternal, omprog, imfile, omfile, mmpstrucdata. The full list of changes to rsyslog can be reviewed in the Changelog.

We have also made some major changes to the RHEL/CentOS packages for rsyslog. We are now using a modified spec file from the CentOS base repository for building the EL7 release RPM. We decided to go this way out of several reasons. The major reason was a huge issue with the startup scripts that we used, which did not really work well on EL7 systems. More details are available here: <http://www.rsyslog.com/major-centos7-rpm-changes/> and here: <https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/2134#issuecomment-355483536>

Another reason is, that we wanted to make our own RPMs more similar to those in the base repository to avoid major conflicts in the future. That also means, that some additional module packages are not available anymore, because they are now included in the base rsyslog package (mmanon, mmutf8fix, ommail and pmaixforwardedfrom). All other additional sub-packages are still available.

Because the Launchpad build environment [1] is currently unavailable, we cannot produce packages for Ubuntu at the moment. They will be published once the systems are available again.

<http://blog.gerhards.net/2017/11/rsyslog-831-important-release.html>

The packages have received some notable changes as well. First off, we were able to implement the Redis output module as a separate package on Ubuntu 14.04 and newer. Also there was a dependency change for the ommongo module, thus it is now only available on Ubuntu 16.04 or newer, but not on CentOS/RHEL anymore. Platform restrictions are unavoidable right now due to dependency availability.

## [rsyslog 8.29.0 (v8-stable) released](https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-8-29-0-v8-stable-released/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [August 8, 2017](https://www.rsyslog.com/rsyslog-8-29-0-v8-stable-released/)Posted in [News](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/news/), [Release Announcement](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/news/release-announcement/)Tagged [8.29.0](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/8-29-0/), [bugfix](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/bugfix/), [error reporting](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/error-reporting/), [imptcp](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/imptcp/), [imtcp](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/imtcp/), [multi-line](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/multi-line/), [omfwd](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/omfwd/), [release](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/release/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [stable](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/stable/), [v8](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/v8/)

We have released rsyslog 8.29.0.

This release features a number of changes. E.g. imptcp now has an experimental parameter for multiline messages, and new statistics counters.

Most notably though, is the improved error reporting in the rsyslog core and in several modules like imtcp, imptcp, omfwd and the core modules. There is also an article available about the improved/enhanced error reporting:

# remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3683

  By [adisconteam](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/adisconteam/)Posted on [October 2, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [CVE-2014-3683](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve-2014-3683/), [PRI](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/pri/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [security](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/security/)

remote syslog PRI vulnerability
 ===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3683

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL
 Updated 2014-10-06: effect on sysklogd milder than in initial assesment

**Reporter**
 ——-
 mancha , intial detection and analysis
 Rainer Gerhards , rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)

**Short Description**
 —————–
 While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and
 privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did
 not cover cases where PRI values > MAX\_INT caused integer overflows
 resulting in negative values.

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can
 happen (for PRI > MAX\_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The
 solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~

This causes no extra problems as CVE-2014-3634 because negative
 PRI values are masked off, so the overflow region is still at a
 maximum of 104 bytes. For more detailsm see CVE-2014-3634.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some
 tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634.
 Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v5 is also likely to segfault, if
 and only if the patch for CVE-2014-3634 is applied.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with a PRI > MAX\_INT needs to be sent and the resulting
 overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<3500000000>”

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations
 and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

**Patches**
 ——-

sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A patch for version 1.5 is available at:
 http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5\_CVE-2014-3634.diff

rsyslog
 ~~~~~~~
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project
 supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative
 PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution. All
 older v7 and v8 versions are vulnerable.

The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is
 purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions.
 Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features
 of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most
 importantly, the “invld” facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also,
 the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages
 with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general,
 it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

All patches and downloads can be found on [http://www.rsyslog.com](http://www.rsyslog.com/files/download/rsyslog/CVE-2014-3683-pri-vuln.tar.gz)

Special thanks to mancha for his suggestions on how to fix the problem. The
 core idea went into the rsyslog patches.

# RSyslog Windows Agent license document – EULA

**RSyslog Windows Agent**

**Version 7.4 Final Release**

**End User License Agreement**

**2023-06-15**

This binary code license (“License”) contains rights and restrictions associated with use of the accompanying software and documentation (“Software”). Read the License carefully before installing the Software. By installing the Software you agree to the terms and conditions of this License.

**1. Limited License Grant.**

Adiscon grants you a non-exclusive License to use the software free of charge for 30 days for the purpose of evaluating whether to purchase a commercial license of RSyslog Windows Agent. After this period, users are required to purchase proper licenses if you continue to use it. If Customer has purchased RSyslog Windows Agent licenses, Customer is permitted to use the purchased product edition under the terms of this license agreement.

**2. Copyright**

The software is confidential copyrighted information of Adiscon GmbH, Germany. You shall not modify, decompile, disassemble, decrypt, extract, or otherwise reverse engineer the software. The software may not be leased, assigned, or sublicensed, in whole or in part. A separate license is required for each computer being monitored by the RSyslog Windows Agent.

**3. Trademarks and logos**

RSyslog Windows Agent is a trademark of Adiscon. Windows is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation. All other trademarks and service marks are the property of their respective owners.

**4. Licensed syslog**

A RSyslog Windows Agent license covers the installation of one system. RSyslog Windows Agent comes in several editions, only the Enterprise Version is permitting the Syslog Listener Service. The RSyslog Windows Agent Enterprise Edition permits you to receive messages from an unlimited number of devices. Please note that instances of Adiscon’s EventReporter and/or RSyslog Windows Agent do NOT count against the remote device count. So you may use a RSyslog Windows Agent Server Professional edition to receive data from 500 servers with Adiscon EventReporter installed on them.

**5. Licensed remote file monitor Clients**

RSyslog Windows Agent can be used to monitor text files on remote systems. This remote monitoring requires a proper license. RSyslog Windows Agent comes in several editions, each of them permitting remote file monitoring for a different number of remote systems, You must purchase the edition of RSyslog Windows Agent that reflects the number of different remote systems being monitored by RSyslog Windows Agent. The RSyslog Windows Agent Basic Edition does **not** permit you to monitor files locally or on remote systems. The RSyslog Windows Agent Professional Edition permits you to monitor files locally and on up to 10 remote systems. The RSyslog Windows Agent Enterprise Edition permits you to monitor files on an unlimited number of remote systems.

Please note that only the number of remote systems counts toward the license. So if you monitor 50 files on a single remote system, this counts as a single license. If you monitor a single file on each one of 50 remote systems, than this counts as 50 licenses.

**6. Licensed remote event log monitor clients**

RSyslog Windows Agent can be used to monitor Windows event logs on remote computers. A full RSyslog Windows Agent license is required for each remote computer on which Windows event logs are being monitored. Technically, the product might count licenses based on the number of remote event log monitors configured. In such cases, a license is required for each remote event log monitor configured.

**7. Product Editions**

A specific edition of the RSyslog Windows Agent product is licensed. Only the specifically licensed version may be used. For example, if a RSyslog Windows Agent Basic Edition is licensed, features of the Professional edition may not be used. The license keys are also technically different, that is a Basic edition license key is technically different from a Professional Edition license key. Thus, a Basic edition license key can not be used to unlock Professional features.

**8. Evaluation period**

The product comes with a free 30 day evaluation period. We strongly encourage all customers to evaluate the product’s fitness for their systems and environment during the evaluation period. Customer agrees to install the product on production systems only after it has proven to be acceptable on similar test systems.

**9. Redistribution**

Everybody is granted permission to redistribute the install set if the following criteria are meet:

– the install set, product and all documentation (including this license) are supplied unaltered

– there is no registration key distributed along with the install set. REGISTRATION KEYS ARE SOLE INTENDED FOR THE ORIGINAL CUSTOMER. IT IS COPYRIGHT FRAUD TO DISTRIBUTE REGISTRATIONS KEYS.

– the redistributor is only allowed to charge a nominal fee if the product is included into a commercial distribution set (e.g. shareware CD collection). For a CD collection, we deem a fee of up to US$ 30 to be reasonable.

– redistribution as part of a book companion CD is OK, as long as the books purpose is not only to cover a CD software collection in which case we deem a cost of US$ 50 for the book to be OK.

**10. Disclaimer of warranty**

The Software is provided “AS IS,” without a warranty of any kind. ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE HEREBY EXCLUDED.

**11. Limitation of liability**

ADISCON SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF USING OR DISTRIBUTING SOFTWARE. IN NO EVENT WILL ADISCON BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADISCON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IT IS THE CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBILITY, TO USE THE EVALUATION PERIOD TO MAKE SURE THE PRODUCT CAN RUN WITHOUT PROBLEMS IN CUSTOMERS ENVIRONMENT.

**12. Severability**

The user must assume the entire risk of using the program. IN NO EVENT WILL ADISCON BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ADISCON RECEIVED FROM YOU FOR A LICENSE TO THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADISCON SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY OTHER PARTY.

**13. Termination**

The License will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with the limitations described herein. On termination, you must destroy all copies of the Software.

**14. Product Parts Not Covered by this License**

RSyslog Windows Agent may include optional parts which are not covered by this license. For example, a free web-based interface for log access (phpLogCon) may be part of the RSyslog Windows Agent package. Any package not licensed under the term of this license will have prominent note as well as its own license document. If in doubt, the RSyslog Windows Agent service, the RSyslog Windows Agent configuration Program and the Interactive Syslog Server as well as accompanying documentation are licensed under this agreement.

**14. High risk activities**

The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Software could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage (“High Risk Activities”). Adiscon specifically disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities.

**15. General Provisions**

This license agreement shall be governed and interpreted in accordance with the substantive law of Germany applicable to contracts made and performed there. The place of performance of the agreement is Germany, Grossrinderfeld notwithstanding where the Customer is situated or any servers are located.

If any provision of this license agreement shall be held void or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it shall be severed from this agreement and shall not affect the remaining provisions. Void clauses are to be construed in such a way that the business purpose of said clauses as envisaged by both parties can be realized in a lawful manner. Except as expressly set forth in this agreement, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this agreement will be without prejudice to its other remedies under this agreement or otherwise.

## [Changelog for 7.6.7 (v7-stable)](https://www.rsyslog.com/changelog-for-7-6-7-v7-stable/)

  By [adisconteam](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/adisconteam/)Posted on [October 2, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/changelog-for-7-6-7-v7-stable/)Posted in [Changelog](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/changelog/)Tagged [7.6.7](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/7-6-7/), [bugfix](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/bugfix/), [Changelog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/changelog/), [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [stable](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/stable/), [v7](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/v7/)

Version 7.6.7 [v7.6-stable] 2014-10-02

* bugfix: the fix for CVE-2014-3634 did not handle all cases
   This is corrected now. See also: [CVE-2014-3683](http://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/)
* fixed a build problem on some platforms
   Thanks to Olaf for the patch
* behaviour change: “msg” of messages with invalid PRI set to “rawmsg”
   When the PRI is invalid, the rest of the header cannot be valid. So
   we move all of it to MSG and do not try to parse it out. Note that
   this is not directly related to the security issue but rather done
   because it makes most sense.

remote syslog PRI vulnerability
 ===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3683

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL
 Updated 2014-10-06: effect on sysklogd milder than in initial assesment

**Reporter**
 ——-
 mancha , intial detection and analysis
 Rainer Gerhards , rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)

**Short Description**
 —————–
 While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and
 privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did
 not cover cases where PRI values > MAX\_INT caused integer overflows
 resulting in negative values.

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can
 happen (for PRI > MAX\_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The
 solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~

This causes no extra problems as CVE-2014-3634 because negative
 PRI values are masked off, so the overflow region is still at a
 maximum of 104 bytes. For more detailsm see CVE-2014-3634.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some
 tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634.
 Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v5 is also likely to segfault, if
 and only if the patch for CVE-2014-3634 is applied.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with a PRI > MAX\_INT needs to be sent and the resulting
 overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<3500000000>”

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations
 and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

**Patches**
 ——-

sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A patch for version 1.5 is available at:
 http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5\_CVE-2014-3634.diff

rsyslog
 ~~~~~~~
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project
 supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative
 PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution. All
 older v7 and v8 versions are vulnerable.

The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is
 purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions.
 Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features
 of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most
 importantly, the “invld” facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also,
 the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages
 with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general,
 it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

All patches and downloads can be found on [http://www.rsyslog.com](http://www.rsyslog.com/files/download/rsyslog/CVE-2014-3683-pri-vuln.tar.gz)

Special thanks to mancha for his suggestions on how to fix the problem. The
 core idea went into the rsyslog patches.

## [remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3634](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [September 30, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [PRI](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/pri/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [security](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/security/)

===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3634

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL

**Reporter**
 ——-
 Rainer Gerhards, rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked 5.8.6+)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)
 – potentially others (see root cause)

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 Note: rsyslogd was forked from sysklogd, and the root cause applies to
 both. For simplicity, here I use sysklogd as this is the base code.

The system header file /usr/include/\*/syslog.h contains the following definitions

#define    LOG\_NFACILITIES    24    /\* current number of facilities \*/
 #define    LOG\_FACMASK    0x03f8    /\* mask to extract facility part \*/
 /\* facility of pri \*/
 #define    LOG\_FAC(p)    (((p) & LOG\_FACMASK) >> 3)

[This is from Ubuntu 12.04LTS, but can be found similarly in most, if
 not all, distributions].

The define LOG\_NFACILITIES is used by sysklogd to size arrays for facility
 processing. In sysklogd, an array for selector matching is using this. Rsyslog
 has additional array. The macro LOG\_FAC() is used to extract the facility from
 a syslog PRI [RFC3164, RFC 5424]. Its result is used to address the arrays.
 Unfortunately, the LOG\_FACMASK permits PRI values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec). This
 translates to 128 facilities. Consequently, for PRI values above 191 the
 LOG\_NFACILITIES arrays are overrun.

Other applications may have similar problems, as LOG\_NFACILITES “sounds” like
 the max value that LOG\_FAC() can return. It would probably make sense to
 check why there is a difference between LOG\_NFACILITES and LOG\_FACMASK, and
 if this really needs to stay. A proper fix would probably be to make LOG\_FAC
 return a valid (maybe special) facility if an invalid one is provided. This
 is the route taken in rsyslog patches.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Sysklogd is mildly affected. Having a quick look at the current git master
 branch, the wrong action may be applied to messages with invalid facility.

A segfault seems unlikely, as the maximum misadressing is 104 bytes of the
 f\_pmask table, which is always within properly allocated memory (albeit to
 wrong data items). This can lead to triggering invalid selector lines and
 thus wrongly writing to files or wrongly forwarding to other hosts.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

However, more severe effects can occur, BUT NOT WITH THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION.
 The most likely and thus important attack is a remote DoS. Some
 of the additional tables are writable and can cause considerable misadressing.
 This is especially true for versions 7 and 8. In those versions, remote code
 injection may also be possible by a carefully crafted package. It sounds hard
 to do, but it cannot be totally outruled [we did not check this in depth].

A segfault (and thus Dos) has the following preconditions:
 – the rsyslog property “pri-text” must be used, either in
 \* templates
 \* conditional statements (RainerScript and property-based filters)
 – the property must actually be accessed
 With traditional selector lines, this depends on the facility causing
 a misadressing that leads to reading a 1 from the misaccessed location.

When the preconditions are met, misadressing happens. The code uses a string
 table and a table of string lengths. Depending on memory layout at time of
 misadressing and depending on the actual invalid PRI value, the lookup to
 the string table can lead to a much to long length, which is the used in
 buffer copy calculations. High PRI values close to the max of 1016 potentially
 cause most problems, but we have also seen segfaults with very low invalid
 PRI values.

Note that, as usual in such situations, a segfault may not happen immediately.
 Instad some data structures may be damaged (e.g. from the memory allocator)
 which will later on result in a segfault.

In v5 and below, a segfault is very unlikely, as snprintf() is used to generate
 the pri-text property. As such, no write overrun can happen (but still garbagge
 be contained inside the property). A segfault could theoretically happen if the
 name lookup table indices cause out-of-process misadressing. We could not manage
 to produce a segfault with v5.

Versions 7.6.3 and 7.6.4 already have partial fixes for the issue and will not
 be vulnerable to a segfault (but the mild other issues described).

All other versions 7 and 8 are vulnerable. Version 6 was not checked as it seems
 no longer be used in practice (it was an interim version). No patch for version 6
 will be provided.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with an invalid PRI value needs to be sent. It is sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<201>”

Any message starting with “<PRI>” where PRI is an integer greater than 191
 can trigger the problem. The maximum offset that can be generated is with
 PRI equal to 1016, as this is the modulus used due to LOG\_FACMASK.

Note that messages with
 – PRI > 191  and
 – PRI modulus 1016 <= 191
 will not lead to misadressing but go into the wrong bin.

Messsages with
 – PRI > 191
 – PRI modulus 1016 > 191
 will go into the wrong bin and lead to misadressing.

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the triggering scenarios, the fact that multiple changes must be made to
 default system configurations and potential problems we classify the severity
 of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is at least not publicly know. Based on (no) bug reports, it
 seems unlikely that it is being exploited, but that’s obviously hard to know for
 sure.

**Patches**
 ——-
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.1 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.6, while no longer being project
 supported received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Please do not yet publish. Feedback is appreciated, especially on the impact severity rating. Patches will be available soon.  Looking forward to your reply.  Rainer remote syslog PRI vulnerability ===============================  CVE: CVE-2014-3634  Status of this report --------------------- PRELIMENARY, work in progress  Reporter ------- Rainer Gerhards <rgerhards@adiscon.com>, rsyslog project lead  Affected -------- - rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked 5.8.6+) - sysklogd (checked most recent versions) - potentially others (see root cause)   Timeline -------- 2014-09-11 issue detected during rsyslog routine maintenance 2014-09-12 confirmed for sysklogd, root cause analysis completed 2014-09-12 contacted Red Hat (Fedora), Debian, SuSe package maintainers,            tried to contact sysklogd team 2014-09-15 tried to find sysklogd security contact via their mailing list 2014-09-17 notified debian security 2014-09-18 tried reaching the sysklogd team a third time  Root Cause ---------- Note: rsyslogd was forked from sysklogd, and the root cause applies to both. For simplicity, here I use sysklogd as this is the base code.  The system header file /usr/include/*/syslog.h contains the following definitions     #define      LOG_NFACILITIES 24      /* current number of facilities */    #define      LOG_FACMASK     0x03f8  /* mask to extract facility part */                                 /* facility of pri */    #define      LOG_FAC(p)      (((p) & LOG_FACMASK) >> 3)  [This is from Ubuntu 12.04LTS, but can be found similarly in most, if not all, distributions].  The define LOG_NFACILITIES is used by sysklogd to size arrays for facility processing. In sysklogd, an array for selector matching is using this. Rsyslog has additional array. The macro LOG_FAC() is used to extract the facility from a syslog PRI [RFC3164, RFC 5424]. Its result is used to address the arrays. Unfortunately, the LOG_FACMASK permits PRI values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec). This translates to 128 facilities. Consequently, for PRI values above 191 the LOG_NFACILITIES arrays are overrun.  Other applications may have similar problems, as LOG_NFACILITES "sounds" like the max value that LOG_FAC() can return. It would probably make sense to check why there is a difference between LOG_NFACILITES and LOG_FACMASK, and if this really needs to stay. A proper fix would probably be to make LOG_FAC return a valid (maybe special) facility if an invalid one is provided. This is the route taken in rsyslog patches.   Effect in Practice ------------------  General ~~~~~~~ Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.  Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server), it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in  such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.  If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.  sysklogd ~~~~~~~~ Sysklogd is mildly affected. Having a quick look at the current git master branch, the wrong action may be applied to messages with invalid facility.  A segfault seems unlikely, as the maximum misadressing is 104 bytes of the f_pmask table, which is always within properly allocated memory (albeit to wrong data items). This can lead to triggering invalid selector lines and thus wrongly writing to files or wrongly forwarding to other hosts.  rsyslogd ~~~~~~~~ Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.  However, more severe effects can occur, BUT NOT WITH THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION. The most likely and thus important attack is a remote DoS. Some of the additional tables are writable and can cause considerable misadressing. This is especially true for versions 7 and 8. In those versions, remote code injection may also be possible by a carefully crafted package. It sounds hard to do, but it cannot be totally outruled [we did not check this in depth].  A segfault (and thus Dos) has the following preconditions: - the rsyslog property "pri-text" must be used, either in   * templates   * conditional statements (RainerScript and property-based filters) - the property must actually be accessed   With traditional selector lines, this depends on the facility causing   a misadressing that leads to reading a 1 from the misaccessed location.  When the preconditions are met, misadressing happens. The code uses a string table and a table of string lengths. Depending on memory layout at time of misadressing and depending on the actual invalid PRI value, the lookup to the string table can lead to a much to long length, which is the used in buffer copy calculations. High PRI values close to the max of 1016 potentially cause most problems, but we have also seen segfaults with very low invalid PRI values.  Note that, as usual in such situations, a segfault may not happen immediately. Instad some data structures may be damaged (e.g. from the memory allocator) which will later on result in a segfault.  In v5 and below, a segfault is very unlikely, as snprintf() is used to generate the pri-text property. As such, no write overrun can happen (but still garbagge be contained inside the property). A segfault could theoretically happen if the name lookup table indices cause out-of-process misadressing. We could not manage to produce a segfault with v5.  Versions 7.6.3 and 7.6.4 already have partial fixes for the issue and will not be vulnerable to a segfault (but the mild other issues described).  All other versions 7 and 8 are vulnerable. Version 6 was not checked as it seems no longer be used in practice (it was an interim version). No patch for version 6 will be provided.  How to Exploit -------------- A syslog message with an invalid PRI value needs to be sent. It is sufficient to send just the PRI as in this example  "<201>"  Any message starting with "<PRI>" where PRI is an integer greater than 191 can trigger the problem. The maximum offset that can be generated is with PRI equal to 1016, as this is the modulus used due to LOG_FACMASK.  Note that messages with - PRI > 191  and - PRI modulus 1016 <= 191 will not lead to misadressing but go into the wrong bin.

For simplicity, here I use sysklogd as this is the base code.  The system header file /usr/include/*/syslog.h contains the following definitions     #define      LOG_NFACILITIES 24      /* current number of facilities */    #define      LOG_FACMASK     0x03f8  /* mask to extract facility part */                                 /* facility of pri */    #define      LOG_FAC(p)      (((p) & LOG_FACMASK) >> 3)  [This is from Ubuntu 12.04LTS, but can be found similarly in most, if not all, distributions].  The define LOG_NFACILITIES is used by sysklogd to size arrays for facility processing. In sysklogd, an array for selector matching is using this. Rsyslog has additional array. The macro LOG_FAC() is used to extract the facility from a syslog PRI [RFC3164, RFC 5424]. Its result is used to address the arrays. Unfortunately, the LOG_FACMASK permits PRI values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec). This translates to 128 facilities. Consequently, for PRI values above 191 the LOG_NFACILITIES arrays are overrun.  Other applications may have similar problems, as LOG_NFACILITES "sounds" like the max value that LOG_FAC() can return. It would probably make sense to check why there is a difference between LOG_NFACILITES and LOG_FACMASK, and if this really needs to stay. A proper fix would probably be to make LOG_FAC return a valid (maybe special) facility if an invalid one is provided. This is the route taken in rsyslog patches.   Effect in Practice ------------------  General ~~~~~~~ Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.  Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server), it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in  such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.  If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.  sysklogd ~~~~~~~~ Sysklogd is mildly affected. Having a quick look at the current git master branch, the wrong action may be applied to messages with invalid facility.  A segfault seems unlikely, as the maximum misadressing is 104 bytes of the f_pmask table, which is always within properly allocated memory (albeit to wrong data items). This can lead to triggering invalid selector lines and thus wrongly writing to files or wrongly forwarding to other hosts.  rsyslogd ~~~~~~~~ Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.  However, more severe effects can occur, BUT NOT WITH THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION. The most likely and thus important attack is a remote DoS. Some of the additional tables are writable and can cause considerable misadressing. This is especially true for versions 7 and 8. In those versions, remote code injection may also be possible by a carefully crafted package. It sounds hard to do, but it cannot be totally outruled [we did not check this in depth].  A segfault (and thus Dos) has the following preconditions: - the rsyslog property "pri-text" must be used, either in   * templates   * conditional statements (RainerScript and property-based filters) - the property must actually be accessed   With traditional selector lines, this depends on the facility causing   a misadressing that leads to reading a 1 from the misaccessed location.  When the preconditions are met, misadressing happens. The code uses a string table and a table of string lengths. Depending on memory layout at time of misadressing and depending on the actual invalid PRI value, the lookup to the string table can lead to a much to long length, which is the used in buffer copy calculations. High PRI values close to the max of 1016 potentially cause most problems, but we have also seen segfaults with very low invalid PRI values.  Note that, as usual in such situations, a segfault may not happen immediately. Instad some data structures may be damaged (e.g. from the memory allocator) which will later on result in a segfault.  In v5 and below, a segfault is very unlikely, as snprintf() is used to generate the pri-text property. As such, no write overrun can happen (but still garbagge be contained inside the property). A segfault could theoretically happen if the name lookup table indices cause out-of-process misadressing. We could not manage to produce a segfault with v5.  Versions 7.6.3 and 7.6.4 already have partial fixes for the issue and will not be vulnerable to a segfault (but the mild other issues described).  All other versions 7 and 8 are vulnerable. Version 6 was not checked as it seems no longer be used in practice (it was an interim version). No patch for version 6 will be provided.  Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple  scenarios for this, but likely ones are:  - reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost - corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk   queue contents (manual recovery is possible).  This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi) is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message files cannot be processed.   How to Exploit -------------- A syslog message with an invalid PRI value needs to be sent. It is sufficient to send just the PRI as in this example  "<201>"  Any message starting with "<PRI>" where PRI is an integer greater than 191 can trigger the problem. The maximum offset that can be generated is with PRI equal to 1016, as this is the modulus used due to LOG_FACMASK.  Note that messages with - PRI > 191  and - PRI modulus 1016 <= 191 will not lead to misadressing but go into the wrong bin.  Messsages with - PRI > 191 - PRI modulus 1016 > 191 will go into the wrong bin and lead to misadressing.   Severity -------- Given the triggering scenarios, the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as  MEDIUM  Note that the probability of a successful attack is LOW. However, the risk of message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is possible using this vulnerability.  This vulnerability is at least not publicly know. Based on (no) bug reports, it seems unlikely that it is being exploited, but that's obviously hard to know for sure.   Patches ------- Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.  Version 8.4.1 is not vulnerable. Version 7.4.6, while no longer being project supported received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

remote syslog PRI vulnerability
 ===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3683

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL
 Updated 2014-10-06: effect on sysklogd milder than in initial assesment

**Reporter**
 ——-
 mancha , intial detection and analysis
 Rainer Gerhards , rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)

**Short Description**
 —————–
 While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and
 privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did
 not cover cases where PRI values > MAX\_INT caused integer overflows
 resulting in negative values.

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can
 happen (for PRI > MAX\_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The
 solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~

This causes no extra problems as CVE-2014-3634 because negative
 PRI values are masked off, so the overflow region is still at a
 maximum of 104 bytes. For more detailsm see CVE-2014-3634.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some
 tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634.
 Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v5 is also likely to segfault, if
 and only if the patch for CVE-2014-3634 is applied.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with a PRI > MAX\_INT needs to be sent and the resulting
 overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<3500000000>”

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations
 and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

**Patches**
 ——-

sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A patch for version 1.5 is available at:
 http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5\_CVE-2014-3634.diff

rsyslog
 ~~~~~~~
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project
 supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative
 PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution. All
 older v7 and v8 versions are vulnerable.

The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is
 purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions.
 Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features
 of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most
 importantly, the “invld” facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also,
 the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages
 with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general,
 it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

All patches and downloads can be found on [http://www.rsyslog.com](http://www.rsyslog.com/files/download/rsyslog/CVE-2014-3683-pri-vuln.tar.gz)

Special thanks to mancha for his suggestions on how to fix the problem. The
 core idea went into the rsyslog patches.

## [remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3634](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [September 30, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [PRI](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/pri/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [security](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/security/)

===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3634

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL

**Reporter**
 ——-
 Rainer Gerhards, rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked 5.8.6+)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)
 – potentially others (see root cause)

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 Note: rsyslogd was forked from sysklogd, and the root cause applies to
 both. For simplicity, here I use sysklogd as this is the base code.

The system header file /usr/include/\*/syslog.h contains the following definitions

#define    LOG\_NFACILITIES    24    /\* current number of facilities \*/
 #define    LOG\_FACMASK    0x03f8    /\* mask to extract facility part \*/
 /\* facility of pri \*/
 #define    LOG\_FAC(p)    (((p) & LOG\_FACMASK) >> 3)

[This is from Ubuntu 12.04LTS, but can be found similarly in most, if
 not all, distributions].

The define LOG\_NFACILITIES is used by sysklogd to size arrays for facility
 processing. In sysklogd, an array for selector matching is using this. Rsyslog
 has additional array. The macro LOG\_FAC() is used to extract the facility from
 a syslog PRI [RFC3164, RFC 5424]. Its result is used to address the arrays.
 Unfortunately, the LOG\_FACMASK permits PRI values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec). This
 translates to 128 facilities. Consequently, for PRI values above 191 the
 LOG\_NFACILITIES arrays are overrun.

Other applications may have similar problems, as LOG\_NFACILITES “sounds” like
 the max value that LOG\_FAC() can return. It would probably make sense to
 check why there is a difference between LOG\_NFACILITES and LOG\_FACMASK, and
 if this really needs to stay. A proper fix would probably be to make LOG\_FAC
 return a valid (maybe special) facility if an invalid one is provided. This
 is the route taken in rsyslog patches.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Sysklogd is mildly affected. Having a quick look at the current git master
 branch, the wrong action may be applied to messages with invalid facility.

A segfault seems unlikely, as the maximum misadressing is 104 bytes of the
 f\_pmask table, which is always within properly allocated memory (albeit to
 wrong data items). This can lead to triggering invalid selector lines and
 thus wrongly writing to files or wrongly forwarding to other hosts.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

However, more severe effects can occur, BUT NOT WITH THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION.
 The most likely and thus important attack is a remote DoS. Some
 of the additional tables are writable and can cause considerable misadressing.
 This is especially true for versions 7 and 8. In those versions, remote code
 injection may also be possible by a carefully crafted package. It sounds hard
 to do, but it cannot be totally outruled [we did not check this in depth].

A segfault (and thus Dos) has the following preconditions:
 – the rsyslog property “pri-text” must be used, either in
 \* templates
 \* conditional statements (RainerScript and property-based filters)
 – the property must actually be accessed
 With traditional selector lines, this depends on the facility causing
 a misadressing that leads to reading a 1 from the misaccessed location.

When the preconditions are met, misadressing happens. The code uses a string
 table and a table of string lengths. Depending on memory layout at time of
 misadressing and depending on the actual invalid PRI value, the lookup to
 the string table can lead to a much to long length, which is the used in
 buffer copy calculations. High PRI values close to the max of 1016 potentially
 cause most problems, but we have also seen segfaults with very low invalid
 PRI values.

Note that, as usual in such situations, a segfault may not happen immediately.
 Instad some data structures may be damaged (e.g. from the memory allocator)
 which will later on result in a segfault.

In v5 and below, a segfault is very unlikely, as snprintf() is used to generate
 the pri-text property. As such, no write overrun can happen (but still garbagge
 be contained inside the property). A segfault could theoretically happen if the
 name lookup table indices cause out-of-process misadressing. We could not manage
 to produce a segfault with v5.

Versions 7.6.3 and 7.6.4 already have partial fixes for the issue and will not
 be vulnerable to a segfault (but the mild other issues described).

All other versions 7 and 8 are vulnerable. Version 6 was not checked as it seems
 no longer be used in practice (it was an interim version). No patch for version 6
 will be provided.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with an invalid PRI value needs to be sent. It is sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<201>”

Any message starting with “<PRI>” where PRI is an integer greater than 191
 can trigger the problem. The maximum offset that can be generated is with
 PRI equal to 1016, as this is the modulus used due to LOG\_FACMASK.

Note that messages with
 – PRI > 191  and
 – PRI modulus 1016 <= 191
 will not lead to misadressing but go into the wrong bin.

Messsages with
 – PRI > 191
 – PRI modulus 1016 > 191
 will go into the wrong bin and lead to misadressing.

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the triggering scenarios, the fact that multiple changes must be made to
 default system configurations and potential problems we classify the severity
 of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is at least not publicly know. Based on (no) bug reports, it
 seems unlikely that it is being exploited, but that’s obviously hard to know for
 sure.

**Patches**
 ——-
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.1 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.6, while no longer being project
 supported received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

## [remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3683](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/)

remote syslog PRI vulnerability
 ===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3683

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL
 Updated 2014-10-06: effect on sysklogd milder than in initial assesment

**Reporter**
 ——-
 mancha , intial detection and analysis
 Rainer Gerhards , rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)

**Short Description**
 —————–
 While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and
 privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did
 not cover cases where PRI values > MAX\_INT caused integer overflows
 resulting in negative values.

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can
 happen (for PRI > MAX\_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The
 solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~

This causes no extra problems as CVE-2014-3634 because negative
 PRI values are masked off, so the overflow region is still at a
 maximum of 104 bytes. For more detailsm see CVE-2014-3634.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some
 tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634.
 Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v5 is also likely to segfault, if
 and only if the patch for CVE-2014-3634 is applied.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with a PRI > MAX\_INT needs to be sent and the resulting
 overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<3500000000>”

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations
 and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

**Patches**
 ——-

sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A patch for version 1.5 is available at:
 http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5\_CVE-2014-3634.diff

rsyslog
 ~~~~~~~
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project
 supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative
 PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution. All
 older v7 and v8 versions are vulnerable.

The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is
 purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions.
 Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features
 of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most
 importantly, the “invld” facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also,
 the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages
 with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general,
 it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

All patches and downloads can be found on [http://www.rsyslog.com](http://www.rsyslog.com/files/download/rsyslog/CVE-2014-3683-pri-vuln.tar.gz)

Special thanks to mancha for his suggestions on how to fix the problem. The
 core idea went into the rsyslog patches.

## [remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3683](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/)

remote syslog PRI vulnerability
 ===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3683

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL
 Updated 2014-10-06: effect on sysklogd milder than in initial assesment

**Reporter**
 ——-
 mancha , intial detection and analysis
 Rainer Gerhards , rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)

**Short Description**
 —————–
 While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and
 privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did
 not cover cases where PRI values > MAX\_INT caused integer overflows
 resulting in negative values.

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can
 happen (for PRI > MAX\_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The
 solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~

This causes no extra problems as CVE-2014-3634 because negative
 PRI values are masked off, so the overflow region is still at a
 maximum of 104 bytes. For more detailsm see CVE-2014-3634.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some
 tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634.
 Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v5 is also likely to segfault, if
 and only if the patch for CVE-2014-3634 is applied.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with a PRI > MAX\_INT needs to be sent and the resulting
 overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<3500000000>”

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations
 and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

**Patches**
 ——-

sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A patch for version 1.5 is available at:
 http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5\_CVE-2014-3634.diff

rsyslog
 ~~~~~~~
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project
 supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative
 PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution. All
 older v7 and v8 versions are vulnerable.

The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is
 purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions.
 Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features
 of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most
 importantly, the “invld” facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also,
 the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages
 with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general,
 it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

All patches and downloads can be found on [http://www.rsyslog.com](http://www.rsyslog.com/files/download/rsyslog/CVE-2014-3683-pri-vuln.tar.gz)

Special thanks to mancha for his suggestions on how to fix the problem. The
 core idea went into the rsyslog patches.

## [remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3634](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [September 30, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [PRI](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/pri/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [security](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/security/)

===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3634

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL

**Reporter**
 ——-
 Rainer Gerhards, rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked 5.8.6+)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)
 – potentially others (see root cause)

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 Note: rsyslogd was forked from sysklogd, and the root cause applies to
 both. For simplicity, here I use sysklogd as this is the base code.

The system header file /usr/include/\*/syslog.h contains the following definitions

#define    LOG\_NFACILITIES    24    /\* current number of facilities \*/
 #define    LOG\_FACMASK    0x03f8    /\* mask to extract facility part \*/
 /\* facility of pri \*/
 #define    LOG\_FAC(p)    (((p) & LOG\_FACMASK) >> 3)

[This is from Ubuntu 12.04LTS, but can be found similarly in most, if
 not all, distributions].

The define LOG\_NFACILITIES is used by sysklogd to size arrays for facility
 processing. In sysklogd, an array for selector matching is using this. Rsyslog
 has additional array. The macro LOG\_FAC() is used to extract the facility from
 a syslog PRI [RFC3164, RFC 5424]. Its result is used to address the arrays.
 Unfortunately, the LOG\_FACMASK permits PRI values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec). This
 translates to 128 facilities. Consequently, for PRI values above 191 the
 LOG\_NFACILITIES arrays are overrun.

Other applications may have similar problems, as LOG\_NFACILITES “sounds” like
 the max value that LOG\_FAC() can return. It would probably make sense to
 check why there is a difference between LOG\_NFACILITES and LOG\_FACMASK, and
 if this really needs to stay. A proper fix would probably be to make LOG\_FAC
 return a valid (maybe special) facility if an invalid one is provided. This
 is the route taken in rsyslog patches.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Sysklogd is mildly affected. Having a quick look at the current git master
 branch, the wrong action may be applied to messages with invalid facility.

A segfault seems unlikely, as the maximum misadressing is 104 bytes of the
 f\_pmask table, which is always within properly allocated memory (albeit to
 wrong data items). This can lead to triggering invalid selector lines and
 thus wrongly writing to files or wrongly forwarding to other hosts.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

However, more severe effects can occur, BUT NOT WITH THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION.
 The most likely and thus important attack is a remote DoS. Some
 of the additional tables are writable and can cause considerable misadressing.
 This is especially true for versions 7 and 8. In those versions, remote code
 injection may also be possible by a carefully crafted package. It sounds hard
 to do, but it cannot be totally outruled [we did not check this in depth].

A segfault (and thus Dos) has the following preconditions:
 – the rsyslog property “pri-text” must be used, either in
 \* templates
 \* conditional statements (RainerScript and property-based filters)
 – the property must actually be accessed
 With traditional selector lines, this depends on the facility causing
 a misadressing that leads to reading a 1 from the misaccessed location.

When the preconditions are met, misadressing happens. The code uses a string
 table and a table of string lengths. Depending on memory layout at time of
 misadressing and depending on the actual invalid PRI value, the lookup to
 the string table can lead to a much to long length, which is the used in
 buffer copy calculations. High PRI values close to the max of 1016 potentially
 cause most problems, but we have also seen segfaults with very low invalid
 PRI values.

Note that, as usual in such situations, a segfault may not happen immediately.
 Instad some data structures may be damaged (e.g. from the memory allocator)
 which will later on result in a segfault.

In v5 and below, a segfault is very unlikely, as snprintf() is used to generate
 the pri-text property. As such, no write overrun can happen (but still garbagge
 be contained inside the property). A segfault could theoretically happen if the
 name lookup table indices cause out-of-process misadressing. We could not manage
 to produce a segfault with v5.

Versions 7.6.3 and 7.6.4 already have partial fixes for the issue and will not
 be vulnerable to a segfault (but the mild other issues described).

All other versions 7 and 8 are vulnerable. Version 6 was not checked as it seems
 no longer be used in practice (it was an interim version). No patch for version 6
 will be provided.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with an invalid PRI value needs to be sent. It is sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<201>”

Any message starting with “<PRI>” where PRI is an integer greater than 191
 can trigger the problem. The maximum offset that can be generated is with
 PRI equal to 1016, as this is the modulus used due to LOG\_FACMASK.

Note that messages with
 – PRI > 191  and
 – PRI modulus 1016 <= 191
 will not lead to misadressing but go into the wrong bin.

Messsages with
 – PRI > 191
 – PRI modulus 1016 > 191
 will go into the wrong bin and lead to misadressing.

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the triggering scenarios, the fact that multiple changes must be made to
 default system configurations and potential problems we classify the severity
 of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is at least not publicly know. Based on (no) bug reports, it
 seems unlikely that it is being exploited, but that’s obviously hard to know for
 sure.

**Patches**
 ——-
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.1 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.6, while no longer being project
 supported received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

# Security Advisories

## [librelp stack buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2018-1000140)](https://www.rsyslog.com/cve-2018-1000140/)

  By [Rainer Gerhards](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/rgerhards/)Posted on [March 26, 2018](https://www.rsyslog.com/cve-2018-1000140/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [librelp](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/librelp/)

On Monday March 19th, 2018, the librelp development team was informed by the security team at [lgtm.com](https://lgtm.com/) (Semmle) about a critical security vulnerability in [librelp](http://www.librelp.com). The vulnerability is a long-standing bug that exists since version 1.1.1 (2013-06-11). It affects the client certificate validation in TLS mode which can lead to a stack buffer overrun and thus remote code execution.

Users of librelp are strongly advised to upgrade their packages as a matter of urgency.

### Affected packages and versions

* librelp 1.2.14 down to 1.1.1

## Disclosure process

The security team followed best practices when they notified the librelp development team, who subsequently validated their claim. As agreed, one of the researchers applied for a CVE but unfortunately made a mistake in the afternoon of March 20th, which lead to high-level information about the vulnerability becoming public via the Distributed Weakness Filing Project [1].

 We have to assume that the vulnerability became publicly known at that point. The librelp team finalized a patch [2] on March 20th, and a new release of librelp was released on March, 21st. It is available in both source and binary form from the project’s package repository. Note that the patch commit message is intentionally vague so as not to attract additional attention while details of the vulnerability were being disclosed.

## The vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused by a call to snprintf on line 1205 of tcp.c [3].

This coding pattern is dangerous, because snprintf returns the number of bytes that it *would have written if the buffer had been big enough*. Most notably, that number is not necessarily equal to the number of bytes that it actually wrote. It is a common mistake to assume that snprintf returns the number of bytes written. In certain situations and if the data provided to snprintf is controlled by an attacker, this can lead to a stack overflow and the potential to remotely execute code. The code analysis provided by lgtm.com detects potentially dangerous uses of snprintf in open source projects: <https://lgtm.com/rules/1505913226124/>

Unfortunately, librelp is indeed vulnerable. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to connect to a TLS-enabled RELP logging interface provided by librelp (for example, as can be provided by rsyslog). The attacker then needs to supply an X.509 certificate containing more than 32KB of “subject alt names”. One of these strings needs to overlap the 32KB boundary. For example, if one of the strings starts 10 bytes before the end of the 32KB buffer but is 100 bytes long, then the loop in librelp’s tcp.c will write the first 10 bytes of the string to the buffer but still increment iAllNames by 100. On the next iteration of the loop, the next string will be written at a starting offset of 32KB + 90. An attacker can control the size of this “gap” by varying the length of the overlapping string and utilize it to control exactly which part of the stack they want to overwrite. In particular, this means that they can avoid overwriting the stack canary, which makes the vulnerability significantly easier to exploit.

The teams at librelp and lgtm.com have not yet released a proof-of-concept exploit for this vulnerability.

## Severity and mitigation

In the opinion of the librelp/rsyslog development team:

1. the vulnerability is unquestionably critical as it could lead to RCE
2. depending on GnuTLS, it may be hard to actually exploit the vulnerability
3. the severity is mitigated if security recommendations are followed

### The use of GnuTLS

librelp uses GnuTLS for handling TLS connections. GnuTLS’s behaviour and handling of overly large fields therefore influences this vulnerability in librelp.

The maximum size of the name fields in question is specified in RFC5280 as follows:

Section 4.1:

> SubjectAltName ::= GeneralNames
>  GeneralNames ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF GeneralName

Appendix B imposes the following “restriction”:

> The construct “SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF” appears in several ASN.1 constructs.  A valid ASN.1 sequence will have zero or more entries. The SIZE (1..MAX) construct constrains the sequence to have at least one entry.  MAX indicates that the upper bound is unspecified.
>  Implementations are free to choose an upper bound that suits their environment.

As such, much depends on the actual GnuTLS binary that is linked to librelp. If it imposes a limit of 32KB (or less), the vulnerability cannot be exploited. We are currently trying to understand the default behavior of GnuTLS in this regard and will update this advisory when we receive new information.

RFC5280 Sect. 4.2.1.6 imposes restrictions on which characters can be used inside the “subject alternative name”. Brief review indicates that some byte sequences are not permitted. If so, and if GnuTLS implements these validations, the ability of an attacker to inject arbitrary code is reduced, making it harder to craft a workable exploit.

Nevertheless, it should be assumed that GnuTLS does not provide any safeguards. Even if there are, and if those safeguards are enabled  by default, we have to consider the possibility of any checks being disabled in a specific binary.

### Trusted networks

Regarding the mitigation of the severity of this vulnerability: users are strongly advised not to expose logging port like syslog TCP and RELP to a public network; these ports are best firewalled to make them available only on a dedicated network. If that advice is followed, the risk is significantly reduced to already-compromised systems on a trusted network.

However, some logs-as-a-service providers do expose RELP on the public Internet. The rsyslog team has been in touch with and/or reviewed documentation for leading providers. Those we checked either do not expose RELP at all or do not support TLS with RELP, and are therefore not at risk.

## [remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3683](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/)

  By [adisconteam](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/adisconteam/)Posted on [October 2, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [CVE-2014-3683](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve-2014-3683/), [PRI](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/pri/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [security](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/security/)

remote syslog PRI vulnerability
 ===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3683

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL
 Updated 2014-10-06: effect on sysklogd milder than in initial assesment

**Reporter**
 ——-
 mancha , intial detection and analysis
 Rainer Gerhards , rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)

**Short Description**
 —————–
 While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and
 privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did
 not cover cases where PRI values > MAX\_INT caused integer overflows
 resulting in negative values.

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can
 happen (for PRI > MAX\_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The
 solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~

This causes no extra problems as CVE-2014-3634 because negative
 PRI values are masked off, so the overflow region is still at a
 maximum of 104 bytes. For more detailsm see CVE-2014-3634.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some
 tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634.
 Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v5 is also likely to segfault, if
 and only if the patch for CVE-2014-3634 is applied.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with a PRI > MAX\_INT needs to be sent and the resulting
 overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<3500000000>”

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations
 and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

**Patches**
 ——-

sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A patch for version 1.5 is available at:
 http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5\_CVE-2014-3634.diff

rsyslog
 ~~~~~~~
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project
 supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative
 PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution. All
 older v7 and v8 versions are vulnerable.

The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is
 purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions.
 Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features
 of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most
 importantly, the “invld” facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also,
 the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages
 with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general,
 it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

All patches and downloads can be found on [http://www.rsyslog.com](http://www.rsyslog.com/files/download/rsyslog/CVE-2014-3683-pri-vuln.tar.gz)

Special thanks to mancha for his suggestions on how to fix the problem. The
 core idea went into the rsyslog patches.

## [remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3634](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [September 30, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [PRI](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/pri/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [security](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/security/)

===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3634

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL

**Reporter**
 ——-
 Rainer Gerhards, rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked 5.8.6+)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)
 – potentially others (see root cause)

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 Note: rsyslogd was forked from sysklogd, and the root cause applies to
 both. For simplicity, here I use sysklogd as this is the base code.

The system header file /usr/include/\*/syslog.h contains the following definitions

#define    LOG\_NFACILITIES    24    /\* current number of facilities \*/
 #define    LOG\_FACMASK    0x03f8    /\* mask to extract facility part \*/
 /\* facility of pri \*/
 #define    LOG\_FAC(p)    (((p) & LOG\_FACMASK) >> 3)

[This is from Ubuntu 12.04LTS, but can be found similarly in most, if
 not all, distributions].

The define LOG\_NFACILITIES is used by sysklogd to size arrays for facility
 processing. In sysklogd, an array for selector matching is using this. Rsyslog
 has additional array. The macro LOG\_FAC() is used to extract the facility from
 a syslog PRI [RFC3164, RFC 5424]. Its result is used to address the arrays.
 Unfortunately, the LOG\_FACMASK permits PRI values up to 0x3f8 (1016 dec). This
 translates to 128 facilities. Consequently, for PRI values above 191 the
 LOG\_NFACILITIES arrays are overrun.

Other applications may have similar problems, as LOG\_NFACILITES “sounds” like
 the max value that LOG\_FAC() can return. It would probably make sense to
 check why there is a difference between LOG\_NFACILITES and LOG\_FACMASK, and
 if this really needs to stay. A proper fix would probably be to make LOG\_FAC
 return a valid (maybe special) facility if an invalid one is provided. This
 is the route taken in rsyslog patches.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Sysklogd is mildly affected. Having a quick look at the current git master
 branch, the wrong action may be applied to messages with invalid facility.

A segfault seems unlikely, as the maximum misadressing is 104 bytes of the
 f\_pmask table, which is always within properly allocated memory (albeit to
 wrong data items). This can lead to triggering invalid selector lines and
 thus wrongly writing to files or wrongly forwarding to other hosts.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

However, more severe effects can occur, BUT NOT WITH THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION.
 The most likely and thus important attack is a remote DoS. Some
 of the additional tables are writable and can cause considerable misadressing.
 This is especially true for versions 7 and 8. In those versions, remote code
 injection may also be possible by a carefully crafted package. It sounds hard
 to do, but it cannot be totally outruled [we did not check this in depth].

A segfault (and thus Dos) has the following preconditions:
 – the rsyslog property “pri-text” must be used, either in
 \* templates
 \* conditional statements (RainerScript and property-based filters)
 – the property must actually be accessed
 With traditional selector lines, this depends on the facility causing
 a misadressing that leads to reading a 1 from the misaccessed location.

When the preconditions are met, misadressing happens. The code uses a string
 table and a table of string lengths. Depending on memory layout at time of
 misadressing and depending on the actual invalid PRI value, the lookup to
 the string table can lead to a much to long length, which is the used in
 buffer copy calculations. High PRI values close to the max of 1016 potentially
 cause most problems, but we have also seen segfaults with very low invalid
 PRI values.

Note that, as usual in such situations, a segfault may not happen immediately.
 Instad some data structures may be damaged (e.g. from the memory allocator)
 which will later on result in a segfault.

In v5 and below, a segfault is very unlikely, as snprintf() is used to generate
 the pri-text property. As such, no write overrun can happen (but still garbagge
 be contained inside the property). A segfault could theoretically happen if the
 name lookup table indices cause out-of-process misadressing. We could not manage
 to produce a segfault with v5.

Versions 7.6.3 and 7.6.4 already have partial fixes for the issue and will not
 be vulnerable to a segfault (but the mild other issues described).

All other versions 7 and 8 are vulnerable. Version 6 was not checked as it seems
 no longer be used in practice (it was an interim version). No patch for version 6
 will be provided.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with an invalid PRI value needs to be sent. It is sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<201>”

Any message starting with “<PRI>” where PRI is an integer greater than 191
 can trigger the problem. The maximum offset that can be generated is with
 PRI equal to 1016, as this is the modulus used due to LOG\_FACMASK.

Note that messages with
 – PRI > 191  and
 – PRI modulus 1016 <= 191
 will not lead to misadressing but go into the wrong bin.

Messsages with
 – PRI > 191
 – PRI modulus 1016 > 191
 will go into the wrong bin and lead to misadressing.

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the triggering scenarios, the fact that multiple changes must be made to
 default system configurations and potential problems we classify the severity
 of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is at least not publicly know. Based on (no) bug reports, it
 seems unlikely that it is being exploited, but that’s obviously hard to know for
 sure.

**Patches**
 ——-
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.1 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.6, while no longer being project
 supported received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

## [Potential DoS with malformed TAG](https://www.rsyslog.com/potential-dos-with-malformed-tag/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [September 1, 2011](https://www.rsyslog.com/potential-dos-with-malformed-tag/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)

***If a malformed, severely too long TAG is used in legacy (RFC3164) syslog messages, rsyslog can abort based on the conditions described in this security advisory.***

**CVE:** CVE-2011-3200

**Affected Stable Versions:**
 v4.6.0 to 4.6.7 (inclusive)
 v5.2.0 to 5.8.4 (inclusive)

Devel and Beta versions are probably also affected, but are not suitable for production and thus not analyzed in detail. Version 3 is not affeceted. Versions prior to 3 have not been analyzed.

**Fix:**
 Update to 4.6.8 or 5.8.5.  The fix is also included in the following non-beta versions: 4.7.5, 5.9.3, 6.1.12, 6.3.5.
 For non current affected versions, the following patches can most probably be applied: v4, v5. Note that due to the myriad of different versions we can not provide individual patches for all outdated versions (and in general it is less secure to run outdated versions).

**Short Description:**
 An excessively long TAG inside a legacy syslog message can lead to a two-byte stack buffer overflow. If rsyslog has been compiled with stack guard, this can lead to an abort. This has been seen on 32bit platforms, but not on 64 bit ones (though not outruled there). If not compiled with stack guard, no fatal problem occurs and the tag character is usually just truncated. Exact behaviour depends on the platform and may be slightly different on compilers different from gcc and/or non-Intel architecture machines.

## [$AllowedSender not honored](https://www.rsyslog.com/article322/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [December 4, 2008](https://www.rsyslog.com/article322/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [$AllowedSender](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/allowedsender/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/)

A primitive way of access control is offered in rsyslog via the $AllowedSender configuration directive. It permits the operator to specify hosts from which messages are being accepted. If the directive is not specified, messages from all hosts are accepted. If it is, the set is limited to those senders that match the configured criteria (this can be network addresses or host name). Access control can be configured for UDP- based and TCP-based protocols independently.

Note that this directive may be used to simplify firewall setup, where the firewall permits incoming traffic from all remote machines on the port in question. Then rsyslog ACLs are used to control who is actually permitted. The down-side of this approach is that the packets reach rsyslog and any vulnerability in it can be exploited. Please note that UDP addresses can easily be spoofed (though thankfully not as easy any longer on the public Internet thanks to more careful configuration on most ISP’s side). So an IP-based access control does not work very well for UDP (neither at the firewall nor at the rsyslog level – but the firewall may have more options at hand, given its comparatively broad knowledge of the perimeter).

## [SQL Injection Vulnerability in rsyslogd](https://www.rsyslog.com/article35/)

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [September 23, 2005](https://www.rsyslog.com/article35/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [SQL Injection](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/sql-injection/)

**An SQL injection vulnerability was found in all rsyslog releases prior to the ones announced on 2005-09-23.** An attacker can send a specifically-crafted syslog message to rsyslogd and potentially take ownership of the machine.

This can be locally exploited if rsyslogd is listening on the local socket. Wes assume it is doing this in almost all cases. It can also be exploited remotely if rsyslogd is listening on network sockets and the attacker is not blocked from sending messages to rsyslogd (e.g. if not blocked by firewalling).

The vulnerability can potentially be used to take full ownership of the computer a compromised rsyslog is running on. The extend of the compromise is depending on the permissions of the user used to connect to MySQL.

We do not know of any case where this was exploited in practice. The bug was discovered during security-testing rsyslogd.

As of this writing, fixed versions exist both for the stable and the development branch. They are named 1.0.1 and 1.10.1. They can be obtained via the following links:

For 1.0.1 stable:
 <http://www.rsyslog.com/Downloads-index-req-getit-lid-17.phtml>

For 1.10.1 development:
 <http://www.rsyslog.com/Downloads-index-req-getit-lid-18.phtml>

**As this is a serious vulnerability, we urge all users to update to the fixed version as soon as possible.**

**If you have turned on NO\_BACKSLASH\_ESCAPES in MySQL, you MUST make changes to your configuration file. Read DETAILS below to learn more.** [Continue reading “SQL Injection Vulnerability in rsyslogd”](https://www.rsyslog.com/article35/#more-130)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=899756#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2014-10-04 19:36:46 UTC  ``` <http://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/>  emote syslog PRI vulnerability ===============================  CVE: CVE-2014-3683  See also CVE: CVE-2014-3634  Status of this report ——————— FINAL  Reporter ——- mancha <mancha1@zoho.com>, intial detection and analysis Rainer Gerhards <rgerhards@adiscon.com>, rsyslog project lead  Affected ——– - rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above) - sysklogd (checked most recent versions)  Short Description —————– While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did not cover cases where PRI values > MAX_INT caused integer overflows resulting in negative values.  Root Cause ———- A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can happen (for PRI > MAX_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.  Effect in Practice ——————  General ~~~~~~~ Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.  Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server), it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.  If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.  sysklogd ~~~~~~~~ A segfault seems possible in sysklogd if a negative facility value (due to integer overrun in facility parsing) is used. This could be used to carry out a remote DoS.  rsyslogd ~~~~~~~~ Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.  As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634. Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog prior to v6 is also likely to segfault.  Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple scenarios for this, but likely ones are:  - reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost - corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk queue contents (manual recovery is possible).  This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi) is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message files cannot be processed.  How to Exploit ————– A syslog message with a PRI > MAX_INT needs to be sent and the resulting overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient to send just the PRI as in this example  ""  Severity ——– Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as  MEDIUM  Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is possible using this vulnerability.  Patches ——-  sysklogd ~~~~~~~~ A patch for version 1.5 is available at: from mancha  rsyslog ~~~~~~~ Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.  Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.  Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution.  The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions. Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most importantly, the "invld" facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also, the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general, it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

# remote syslog PRI vulnerability – CVE: CVE-2014-3683

  By [adisconteam](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/adisconteam/)Posted on [October 2, 2014](https://www.rsyslog.com/remote-syslog-pri-vulnerability-cve-2014-3683/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)Tagged [CVE](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve/), [CVE-2014-3683](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/cve-2014-3683/), [PRI](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/pri/), [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/rsyslog/), [security](https://www.rsyslog.com/tag/security/)

remote syslog PRI vulnerability
 ===============================

CVE: CVE-2014-3683

**Status of this report**
 ———————
 FINAL
 Updated 2014-10-06: effect on sysklogd milder than in initial assesment

**Reporter**
 ——-
 mancha , intial detection and analysis
 Rainer Gerhards , rsyslog project lead

**Affected**
 ——–
 – rsyslog, most probably all versions (checked v3-stable and above)
 – sysklogd (checked most recent versions)

**Short Description**
 —————–
 While preparing a fix for CVE-2014-3634 for sysklogd, mancha discovered and
 privately reported that the initial rsyslog fix set was incomplete. It did
 not cover cases where PRI values > MAX\_INT caused integer overflows
 resulting in negative values.

**Root Cause**
 ———-
 A while parsing the syslog message’s PRI value, an integer overlow can
 happen (for PRI > MAX\_INT), which may cause negative PRI values. The
 solutions provided in CVE-2014-3634 do not handle that case.

**Effect in Practice**
 ——————

**General**
 ~~~~~~~
 Almost all distributions do ship rsyslog without remote reception by
 default and almost all distros also put firewall rules into place that
 prevent reception of syslog messages from remote hosts (even if rsyslog
 would be listening). With these defaults, it is impossible to trigger
 the vulnerability in v7 and v8. Older versions may still be vulnerable
 if a malicious user writes to the local log socket.

Even when configured to receive remote message (on a central server),
 it is good practice to protect such syslog servers to accept only
 messages from trusted peers, e.g. within the relay chain. If setup in
 such a way, a trusted peer must be compromised to send malfromed
 messages. This further limits the magnitude of the vulnerability.

If, however, any system is permitted to send data unconditionally to
 the syslogd, a remote attack is possible.

**sysklogd**
 ~~~~~~~~

This causes no extra problems as CVE-2014-3634 because negative
 PRI values are masked off, so the overflow region is still at a
 maximum of 104 bytes. For more detailsm see CVE-2014-3634.

**rsyslogd**
 ~~~~~~~~
 Rsyslogd experiences the same problem as sysklogd.

As in CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v7 and v8 have an elevated risk due to some
 tables lookups used during writing. For details see CVE2014-3634.
 Contrary to CVE-2014-3634, rsyslog v5 is also likely to segfault, if
 and only if the patch for CVE-2014-3634 is applied.

Note that a segfault of rsyslog can cause message loss. There are multiple
 scenarios for this, but likely ones are:

– reception via UDP, where all messages arriving during downtime are lost
 – corruption of disk queue structures, which can lead to loss of all disk
 queue contents (manual recovery is possible).

This list does not try to be complete. Note that disk queue corruption is likely
 to occur in default settings, because the important queue information file (.qi)
 is only written on successful shutdown. Without a valid .qi file, queue message
 files cannot be processed.

**How to Exploit**
 ————–
 A syslog message with a PRI > MAX\_INT needs to be sent and the resulting
 overflow must lead to a negative value. It is usually sufficient
 to send just the PRI as in this example

“<3500000000>”

**Severity**
 ——–
 Given the fact that multiple changes must be made to default system configurations
 and potential problems we classify the severity of this vulnerability as

MEDIUM

Note that the probability of a successful attack is on LOW. However, the risk of
 message loss is HIGH in those rare instances where an attack is successful. As
 mentioned above, it cannot totally be outruled that remote code injection is
 possible using this vulnerability.

**Patches**
 ——-

sysklogd
 ~~~~~~~~
 A patch for version 1.5 is available at:
 http://sf.net/projects/mancha/files/sec/sysklogd-1.5\_CVE-2014-3634.diff

rsyslog
 ~~~~~~~
 Patches are available for versions known to be in wide-spread use.

Version 8.4.2 is not vulnerable. Version 7.6.7, while no longer being project
 supported, received a patch and is also not vulnerable.

Versions 8.4.1 and 7.6.6 do NOT handle integer overflows and resulting negative
 PRI values correctly. So upgrading to them is NOT a sufficient solution. All
 older v7 and v8 versions are vulnerable.

The rsyslog project also provides patches for older versions 5 and 3. This is
 purely a convenience to those that still run these very outdated versions.
 Note that these patches address the segfault issue. They do NOT offer all features
 of the v7/8 series, as this would require considerate code changes. Most
 importantly, the “invld” facility is not available in the v3 patch. Also,
 the dead-version patches do not try to assing a specific severity to messages
 with invalid PRI values nor do they prevent parsing those messages. In general,
 it is suggested to upgrade to the currently supported version 8.4.2.

Special thanks to mancha for his suggestions on how to fix the problem. The
 core idea went into the rsyslog patches.
