Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3690:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content explicitly mentions `CVE-2014-3690` and describes a vulnerability related to the handling of the CR4 control register in the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem. This aligns with the official CVE description that describes a vulnerability related to the Linux kernel's KVM subsystem and the CR4 register. Thus, the content is relevant to CVE-2014-3690.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw exists in the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem regarding how it handles the CR4 control register during VM entry on Intel processors. Specifically, the value of the host CR4 register is not properly preserved or validated across VM entries, allowing modifications to occur unexpectedly.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper handling of the CR4 control register during VM entries.  The host's CR4 register value is not ensured to remain constant across VM entries, leading to an inconsistent state.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local host OS user can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service, which might manifest as killing arbitrary processes or other system disruptions.  Some sources indicate this can cause a system crash or kernel panic.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Some sources mention this vulnerability might, in some circumstances, allow for privilege escalation in the host OS or other targeted user processes, although such exploitation would be complex and possibly unreliable due to potential races and system instability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by a local host OS user.
    *   **/dev/kvm Access:** Exploitation requires leveraging access to the `/dev/kvm` device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs local access to the host operating system.
    *   The attacker must have the ability to access and interact with the `/dev/kvm` device, which typically requires specific permissions or being a privileged user or having compromised a privileged user context (e.g. in the host operating system).

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects kernels that support VMX (Intel's Virtualization Technology).
*   The vulnerability is not directly triggered by guest users but rather by a malicious host OS user or through a guest that compromised its host QEMU to take down other guest running on the same host.
*   Several sources indicate that a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit has been developed which causes a spectacular system failure.
*   Patches involve ensuring the host CR4 control register value remains unchanged or properly validating/restoring it across VM entries.

**4. Content Details Beyond the CVE:**

*   The provided text details several conditions and scenarios under which this vulnerability can be triggered, such as specific Intel processor features or exploitation via QEMU.
*   Some of the provided sources link to other CVEs or bug reports, showing that this vulnerability was often found alongside other related issues in KVM and the Linux kernel.
*   Red Hat specifically mentions that the fix includes the introduction of the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` functionality, along with related SELinux execution transitions support, as part of the larger fix. This is more granular than the official CVE.

**5. Summary of key technical details:**
* Malicious local user access to /dev/kvm can cause a denial of service on the host operating system, because of improper handling of the CR4 control register during VM entry on Intel Processors.
* The exploit could lead to a crash of the entire operating system or kernel panic.
* An attacker needs access to `/dev/kvm` device.

In summary, the provided content contains significant details about the root cause, impact, and attack vectors associated with CVE-2014-3690, expanding beyond the basic description in the CVE to give more context.
