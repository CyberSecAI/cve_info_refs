Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure processing mode within the ajax pseudo-URL handler of the Cogent DataHub web server. This insecure mode can be activated by sending a specific request to any Gamma script file that utilizes a particular class.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection (CWE-94):** The core issue is that the application does not properly control the generation of code, allowing for the injection of malicious code.
- **Insecure Processing Mode:** The web server has a processing mode that, when activated, allows the execution of arbitrary script commands.
- **Command Injection:** The `GetPermissions.asp` component is vulnerable to command injection which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the DataHub process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Denial of Service:** The server could be made unavailable.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information stored on the server could be accessed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.
- **Web Server Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered through requests to the web server component of Cogent DataHub.
- **Specific Gamma Script Files:** Attackers target requests to gamma script files using a specific vulnerable class.
- **`GetPermissions.asp` Component:** The `GetPermissions.asp` component of the web server is vulnerable to command injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Cogent DataHub web server.
- **Low Skill Level:** The exploitability is considered easy, meaning an attacker with low skill can exploit the vulnerability.
- **No Authentication Required:** Exploitation can occur without needing to authenticate with the web server.

**Additional details not in the CVE description:**
- Specific component: The `GetPermissions.asp` component of the web server.
- Exploitation does not require authentication.
- Specific file `AJAXSupport.g` is also involved.
- Mitigation steps include deleting the file `C:\Program files (x86)\Cogent\Cogent DataHub\require\AJAXSupport.g`
- Cogent has released a patch in version 7.3.9.
- The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned `ZDI-14-136` and `ZDI-CAN-2160` to the issue.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides protection with filter ID ['13815'].
