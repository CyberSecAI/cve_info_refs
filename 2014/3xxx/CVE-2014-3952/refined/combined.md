How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : kfreebsd-9
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3711 CVE-2014-3952 CVE-2014-3953 CVE-2014-8476

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or information disclosure.

CVE-2014-3711

    Denial of service through memory leak in sandboxed namei lookups.

CVE-2014-3952

    Kernel memory disclosure in sockbuf control messages.

CVE-2014-3953

    Kernel memory disclosure in SCTP. This update disables SCTP, since the
    userspace tools shipped in Wheezy didn't support SCTP anyway.

CVE-2014-8476

    Kernel stack disclosure in setlogin() and getlogin().

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.8.

We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.

FreeBSD-SA-14:17.kmem Security Advisory

Topic: Kernel memory disclosure in control messages and SCTP
notifications
Category: core
Module: kern, sctp
Announced: 2014-07-08

CVE Name: CVE-2014-3952, CVE-2014-3953
For general information regarding FreeBSD Security Advisories,
including descriptions of the fields above, security branches, and the
following sections, please visit .
I. Background
The control message API is used to construct ancillary data objects for
use in control messages sent and received across sockets and passed via
the recvmsg(2) and sendmsg(2) system calls.
II. Problem Description
Buffer between control message header and data may not be completely
initialized before being copied to userland. [CVE-2014-3952]
Three SCTP cmsgs, SCTP\_SNDRCV, SCTP\_EXTRCV and SCTP\_RCVINFO, have implicit
padding that may not be completely initialized before being copied to
userland. In addition, three SCTP notifications, SCTP\_PEER\_ADDR\_CHANGE,
SCTP\_REMOTE\_ERROR and SCTP\_AUTHENTICATION\_EVENT, have padding in the
returning data structure that may not be completely initialized before
being copied to userland. [CVE-2014-3953]
III. Impact
An unprivileged local process may be able to retrieve portion of kernel
memory.
For the generic control message, the process may be able to retrieve a
maximum of 4 bytes of kernel memory.
For SCTP, the process may be able to retrieve 2 bytes of kernel memory
for all three control messages, plus 92 bytes for SCTP\_SNDRCV and 76
bytes for SCTP\_EXTRCV. If the local process is permitted to receive
SCTP notification, a maximum of 112 bytes of kernel memory may be
returned to userland.
This information might be directly useful, or it might be leveraged to
obtain elevated privileges in some way. For example, a terminal buffer
might include a user-entered password.
IV. Workaround
No workaround is available.
V. Solution
Perform one of the following:
1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or
release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date.
