Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-3487:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content, specifically from `rhn.redhat.com_07a5948a_20250125_201858.html` (Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2014:1766), `lists.opensuse.org_5af65054_20250125_201855.html`, `support.apple.com_0c2c64c8_20250125_201903.html`, `marc.info_6335f969_20250125_201857.html`, `www.oracle.com_b3f3b03e_20250125_201906.html` and `bugzilla.redhat.com_13d68f66_20250126_114046.html` all mention **CVE-2014-3487** within the context of a security vulnerability related to the `file` extension or `php5-php` packages. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **boundary check flaw** found in the `cdf_read_property_info` function within the File Information (fileinfo) extension of PHP. This function is responsible for parsing metadata within Composite Document Format (CDF) files.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Boundary Check:** The `cdf_read_property_info` function does not properly validate the boundaries of data it is processing when parsing CDF files. This leads to out-of-bounds reads that may result in a crash.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a PHP application to crash. This can be triggered remotely, leading to a DoS. 
*   **Possible Arbitrary Code Execution:**  While not explicitly stated in all sources, the Red Hat advisory (RHSA-2014:1766) indicates that these types of flaws in the exif extension could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   The openSUSE security update also specifies that this vulnerability may lead to application crashes.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted CDF file, which can be delivered remotely.
*   The Red Hat security advisory also states that these flaws can be exploited remotely.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious CDF File:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious CDF file.
*   **PHP Application Using Fileinfo:** The targeted system must be running a PHP application that utilizes the fileinfo extension to process the malicious CDF file.
*   **No authentication required:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication, making it easier to exploit.

**Additional Details Beyond CVE Description:**

*   The Red Hat advisory (RHSA-2014:1766) provides additional context by listing other related CVEs that were fixed in the same update, indicating that this vulnerability is part of a broader set of security issues in PHP.
*   The openSUSE update (openSUSE-SU-2014:1236-1) also bundles a fix for CVE-2014-3487 with several other PHP related vulnerabilities, suggesting a larger security flaw.
*   The Oracle bulletin explicitly lists this as a vulnerability for "Solaris"
*   The Apple security update details that this vulnerability affects "apache\_mod\_php"
*   The information from `secunia.com` indicates that this vulnerability is part of their vulnerability intelligence.
*   The `marc.info` link contains an HP security bulletin about this specific vulnerability, stating that it could be exploited to execute arbitrary code, create a Denial of Service (DoS), or other vulnerabilities in PHP.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry confirms that the vulnerability is a "cdf\_read\_property\_info insufficient boundary check" in the "file" component of php.

In summary, the extracted content provides detailed information about a boundary check vulnerability (CVE-2014-3487) within the PHP fileinfo extension that could lead to denial of service, and potentially code execution, when processing specially crafted CDF files. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and doesn't require authentication, making it a significant security concern for systems using affected PHP versions. Several vendors provide patches and mitigations against this vulnerability.
