  "CVE-2014-3538": {
    "description": "The provided documents discuss a vulnerability in the `file` command and PHP's `fileinfo` extension, where the incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345, which was about excessive backtracking in awk regular expression processing, allows for unrestricted regular expression matching leading to excessive CPU consumption and application crashes. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from how the `file` command and `fileinfo` extension handles specially crafted input that triggers backtracking during the processing of a regular expression rule. This affects applications that use the fileinfo extension, like PHP applications.",
    "affected_components": [
      "file command",
      "php fileinfo extension"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause is an insufficient input validation flaw in the regex matching, leading to excessive backtracking and potentially a denial-of-service.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345",
       "Unrestricted regular expression matching"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) via resource consumption or application crashes by sending crafted inputs that trigger the vulnerable regular expressions. On 32 bit systems, this can lead to a pointer overflow due to an insufficient input validation flaw.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network access",
      "Specially crafted files (CDF files)",
      "Specially crafted input to applications using the `file` command or the `fileinfo` extension"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Remote unauthenticated attacker capable of submitting crafted files",
      "Ability to influence data processed by vulnerable software"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is exploitable by triggering backtracking during regular expression processing. This can also lead to a pointer overflow if proper size limits are not implemented.  The vulnerability was initially addressed by implementing a search limit but this was found insufficient. A later fix introduced the `<length>` modifier to limit regex search, with an implicit byte limit of 8 KiB if no length is specified. A line count specifier was also introduced with an assumed 80 characters per line for calculating byte size. The commit `4a284c89d6ef11aca34da65da7d673050a5ea320` enforces this limit on regex searches without explicit limits. Additionally a vulnerability was found in the way file uses the cdf_read_property_info function, leading to a pointer overflow on 32bit systems."
