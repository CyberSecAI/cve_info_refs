Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-3589:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing input sanitization in the icns decoder of the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and Pillow. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in `PIL/IcnsImagePlugin.py` when processing crafted block sizes within an ICNS image file.
*   **Weakness:** The code doesn't properly validate the block size in the ICNS image header.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted ICNS image file to an application using the affected PIL/Pillow library.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious ICNS file to a system or application that uses the vulnerable PIL/Pillow library to process images. No authentication is required.

**Impact:**

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). A remote attacker can cause the application to crash or become unresponsive by triggering excessive resource consumption (e.g., memory allocation) due to the invalid block size.

**Affected Software:**

*   Python Imaging Library (PIL)
*   Pillow versions before 2.3.2
*   Pillow versions 2.5.x before 2.5.2

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Pillow 2.3.2 or 2.5.2, or later versions, where the vulnerability is fixed.
*   Apply relevant security patches provided by SUSE and Debian.

**Technical Details (from the Git commit):**

*   The fix involves checking if the `blocksize` from the header is less than or equal to 0, and raising a `SyntaxError` if it is invalid.

```python
if blocksize <= 0:
    raise SyntaxError('invalid block header')
```

A test case (`Tests/check_icns_dos.py`) was also added to verify the fix and prevent regressions:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

if bytes is str:
    Image.open(BytesIO(bytes('icns\x00\x00\x00\x10hang\x00\x00\x00\x00')))
else:
    Image.open(BytesIO(bytes('icns\x00\x00\x00\x10hang\x00\x00\x00\x00', 'latin-1')))
```
