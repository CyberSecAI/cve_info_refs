- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Motorola SBG901 Wireless Modem's web application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of CSRF protection in the web application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate user data, specifically changing the username, password, DNS service, and hostname of the victim's modem without the victim's knowledge.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a victim a malicious crafted URL containing a form that makes POST requests to the modem's configuration interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the malicious crafted URL in their browser while the victim is logged into the modem's web interface. The attacker also needs to know the IP address of the modem (which is usually on the local network).
