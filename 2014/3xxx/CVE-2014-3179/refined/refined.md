Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3179:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is described as "Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives" suggesting a broad range of underlying issues rather than a single specific flaw. This is further supported by the Debian Security Advisory stating, "The Google Chrome development team addressed multiple issues with potential security impact for chromium 37.0.2062.120."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The content indicates the presence of multiple unspecified vulnerabilities found through internal security audits, fuzzing and other security initiatives. These are not detailed individually but are collectively addressed in the update.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The Gentoo Security Advisory states that a remote attacker could cause a "Denial of Service condition or possibly have other unspecified impact" by exploiting these vulnerabilities. The Debian Security Advisory broadly notes "several vulnerabilities were discovered in the chromium web browser" which can have a potential security impact. The Google blog indicates that the fixes are related to internal audits and fuzzing.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is "remote," meaning the attacker does not require local access to the victim's machine to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to deliver malicious content to a vulnerable Chromium browser. This could be achieved through a variety of methods such as:
- Hosting a malicious website.
- Injecting malicious content into a legitimate website.
- Sending an email or message with malicious links.

In summary, CVE-2014-3179 is an umbrella CVE that covers a collection of security fixes. These were found through internal audits and fuzzing. The impact could be Denial of Service or other unspecified impacts, with a remote attack vector.
