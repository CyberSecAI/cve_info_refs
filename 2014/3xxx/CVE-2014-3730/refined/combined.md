## Security releases issued

Posted by **Florian Apolloner** on May 14, 2014

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.4.13, Django 1.5.8, Django 1.6.5 and Django 1.7 beta 4 -- as part of our security process. These releases are now available on PyPI and our download page.

These releases address a caching issue which might lead to cache poisoning and an incorrect validation of safe redirect targets. Since these issues will affect the majority of users we strongly encourage everyone to upgrade.

For more details, read on.

#### Issue: Caches may be allowed to store and serve private data (CVE-2014-1418)

In certain situations, Django may allow caches to store private data
related to a particular session and then serve that data to requests
with a different session, or no session at all. This can both lead to
information disclosure, and can be a vector for cache poisoning.

When using Django sessions, Django will set a Vary: Cookie header
to ensure caches do not serve cached data to requests from other
sessions. However, older versions of Internet Explorer (most likely
only Internet Explorer 6, and Internet Explorer 7 if run on Windows XP
or Windows Server 2003) are unable to handle the Vary header in
combination with many content types. Therefore, Django would remove
the header if the request was made by Internet Explorer.

To remedy this, the special behavior for these older Internet
Explorer versions has been removed, and the Vary header is no
longer stripped from the response. In addition, modifications to the
Cache-Control header for all Internet Explorer requests with a
Content-Disposition header, have also been removed as they were
found to have similar issues.

Thanks to Seth Arnold at Canonical for reporting this issue to us, and to Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart, James Westby for discovering the issue and reporting it to Canonical.

#### Issue: Malformed URLs from user input incorrectly validated (CVE-2014-3730)

The validation for redirects did not correctly validate some malformed
URLs, which are accepted by some browsers. This allows a user to be
redirected to an unsafe URL unexpectedly.

Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
django.contrib.auth.views.login, django.contrib.comments,
and i18n) to redirect the user to an "on
success" URL. The security checks for these redirects (namely
django.util.http.is\_safe\_url()) did not correctly validate some
malformed URLs, such as http:\\\djangoproject.com, which are
accepted by some browsers with more liberal URL parsing.

To remedy this, the validation in is\_safe\_url() has been tightened
to be able to handle and correctly validate these malformed URLs.

Thanks to Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl for reporting this issue to us.

#### Affected versions

>> Issue: Malformed URLs from user input incorrectly validated

>>
>> Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.

>> http:\\\djangoproject.com, which are accepted by some browsers with
>> more liberal URL parsing.
>>
>> To remedy this, the validation in is_safe_url() has been tightened to
>> be able to handle and correctly validate these malformed URLs.

# USN-2212-1: Django vulnerabilities

15 May 2014

Django applications could be made to expose sensitive information over
the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [python-django](/security/cves?package=python-django) - High-level Python web development framework

## Details

Stephen Stewart, Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby

discovered that Django improperly removed Vary and Cache-Control headers

from HTTP responses when replying to a request from an Internet Explorer

or Chrome Frame client. An attacker may use this to retrieve private data

or poison caches. This update removes workarounds for bugs in Internet

Explorer 6 and 7. ([CVE-2014-1418](/security/CVE-2014-1418))

Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django did not correctly

validate some malformed URLs, which are accepted by some browsers. An

attacker may use this to cause unexpected redirects. An update has been

provided for 12.04 LTS, 12.10, 13.10, and 14.04 LTS; this issue remains

unfixed for 10.04 LTS as no "is\_safe\_url()" functionality existed in

this version.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE Reuest: Django: Malformed URLs from user input incorrectly
 validated

Hi

The Django project announced a new security release today:

<https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2014/may/14/security-releases-issued/>

It fixes two issues, for which one has already a CVE (CVE-2014-1418).
It also fixes a second issue, for which a CVE is missing, quoting from
the announcement:

> Issue: Malformed URLs from user input incorrectly validated
> The validation for redirects did not correctly validate some malformed
> URLs, which are accepted by some browsers. This allows a user to be
> redirected to an unsafe URL unexpectedly.
>
> Django relies on user input in some cases (e.g.
> django.contrib.auth.views.login, django.contrib.comments, and i18n) to
> redirect the user to an "on success" URL. The security checks for
> these redirects (namely django.util.http.is_safe_url()) did not
> correctly validate some malformed URLs, such as
> http:\\\djangoproject.com, which are accepted by some browsers with
> more liberal URL parsing.
>
> To remedy this, the validation in is_safe_url() has been tightened to
> be able to handle and correctly validate these malformed URLs.
>
> Thanks to Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl for reporting this issue to us.

Fixes for the various branches are also referenced. Could a CVE also
be assigned for this second issue?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Salvatore

Package        : python-django
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0472 CVE-2014-0473 CVE-2014-0474 CVE-2014-1418
                 CVE-2014-3730

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-0472

    Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted
    Python paths when using the reverse() URL resolver function. An
    attacker able to request a specially crafted view from a Django
    application could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary
    modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution.

CVE-2014-0473

    Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain
    pages that contained CSRF cookies. A remote attacker could use this
    flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass
    intended CSRF protections in a Django application.

CVE-2014-0474

    Michael Koziarski discovered that certain Django model field classes
    did not properly perform type conversion on their arguments, which
    allows remote attackers to obtain unexpected results.

CVE-2014-1418

    Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby discovered that
    cached data in Django could be served to a different session, or to
    a user with no session at all. An attacker may use this to retrieve
    private data or poison caches.

CVE-2014-3730

    Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly
    validated certain malformed URLs from user input. An attacker may
    use this to cause unexpected redirects.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze10.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u7.

For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.
