Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of malformed URLs within Django's `is_safe_url()` function. This function is used to check if a given URL is safe for redirection. The function did not properly handle URLs that, while technically malformed, are still accepted by some browsers due to their lenient parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate URL Validation:** The core weakness is the failure of `is_safe_url()` to correctly identify and reject malformed URLs, specifically those containing backslashes instead of forward slashes (e.g., `http:\\\djangoproject.com`).
*   **Bypass of Security Checks:** The inadequate validation allows malicious URLs to bypass the intended security checks designed to prevent users from being redirected to unsafe external sites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unsafe Redirects:** An attacker can craft malformed URLs that, despite the intended security checks, redirect users to arbitrary and potentially malicious external websites. This could lead to phishing attacks or other forms of user compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by user-provided URLs. This input is typically used in scenarios where Django redirects the user to a provided URL, such as:
    *   Login pages (`django.contrib.auth.views.login`)
    *   Comment sections (`django.contrib.comments`)
    *   Internationalization (`i18n`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Supply User Input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply user-controlled data that is used by Django to create a redirect URL. This might be achieved through a crafted URL or a form.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Django Applications:** The attacker needs to target a Django application that uses the vulnerable redirect functionality and has not been patched.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The issue was reported by Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl.
*   The fix involves tightening the validation in `is_safe_url()` to correctly handle malformed URLs. Specifically, the fix replaces backslashes with forward slashes and rejects URLs starting with `///`.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Django including master, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, and 1.4. Patches were released for all affected versions.
*   The vulnerability is described as a "Malformed URLs from user input incorrectly validated" issue in the Django security release notes.
*   Ubuntu security notice (USN-2212-1) also mentions this vulnerability.
*   OpenSUSE also released a security update to fix this (among others).
