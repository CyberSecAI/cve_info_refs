        "rootCause": "Three SCTP cmsgs (SCTP_SNDRCV, SCTP_EXTRCV, SCTP_RCVINFO) and three SCTP notifications (SCTP_PEER_ADDR_CHANGE, SCTP_REMOTE_ERROR, SCTP_AUTHENTICATION_EVENT) have padding in the returning data structure that may not be completely initialized before being copied to userland.",

Specifically, 2 bytes of kernel memory for all three control messages, plus 92 bytes for SCTP_SNDRCV and 76 bytes for SCTP_EXTRCV. If the local process is permitted to receive SCTP notifications, a maximum of 112 bytes of kernel memory may be returned to userland.",
