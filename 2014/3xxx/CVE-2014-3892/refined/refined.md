Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Meridian software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    *   Defacing web pages.
    *   Performing actions on the user's behalf.
    *   Potentially gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network-based, meaning it can be exploited remotely.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a crafted URL or interacting with a maliciously crafted web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker:**  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required**: Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability

**Affected Products:**
*   Meridian versions prior to 2014

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Kazuyuki Matsuda.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a stored or persistent XSS vulnerability. This is inferred based on the description that an arbitrary script could be executed in the user's web browser, without being specific about the method of attack.
*   The CVSS base score is 2.6, with a high Access Complexity, partial Integrity impact and no Confidentiality or Availability impact.

This information aligns with the nature of a typical XSS vulnerability and provides more detail than a simple CVE description.
