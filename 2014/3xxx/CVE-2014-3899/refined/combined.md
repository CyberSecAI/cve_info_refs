Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the confidentiality of the system. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the integrity of the system. |
