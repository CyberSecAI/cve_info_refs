Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-3475:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper output encoding of user email addresses on the `/admin/users/` page within the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. The application utilizes the `urlize` filter which expects pre-escaped data, but the email addresses are not properly sanitized before being passed to the filter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. User email addresses are not validated during the creation process, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script tags into the email field. This injected script is then stored and executed when the `/admin/users/` page is viewed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
*   Session hijacking of other Horizon users/administrators
*   Malware implantation
*   Potential asset stealing like  credentials, VMs/Network configuration/management and tenantsâ€™ confidential information

**Attack vectors:**
*   A malicious Horizon administrator creates a user with a crafted email address containing malicious JavaScript.
*   An administrative user views the `/admin/users/` page and the JavaScript within the email is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must have administrative privileges to create or modify users.
* The attacker needs to be able to create a user account with a malicious email address.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was found in OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon).
*   The affected versions are up to 2013.2.3 and 2014.1.
*   The fix involves ensuring user emails are properly escaped before being used in the `urlize` filter.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Michael Xin (Rackspace).
*   The vulnerability is related to other XSS vulnerabilities and is part of a common advisory (OSSA-2014-023) that addresses multiple XSS issues within the Horizon project.
* Patches were provided for master, Icehouse and Havana branches.
