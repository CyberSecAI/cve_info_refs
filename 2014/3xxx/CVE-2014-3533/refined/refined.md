Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-3533:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw in the D-Bus daemon's handling of file descriptor passing. Specifically, when multiple messages containing file descriptors are processed in quick succession, the daemon incorrectly tracks the remaining file descriptors in the loader.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect file descriptor tracking:** The `memmove` operation within the `load_message` function in `dbus/dbus-message.c` had its source and destination arguments swapped and also incorrectly copied bytes instead of integers resulting in overwriting or duplicating file descriptors
- **Invalid file descriptor passing:** This leads to the possibility of the D-Bus daemon attempting to forward invalid file descriptors to a service or application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A local attacker can force a targeted service or application to disconnect from the D-Bus system. Since many services exit when disconnected, this can lead to a service crash and DoS.
-  The vulnerability could cause the D-Bus daemon to disconnect the target service, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A malicious local process sends crafted messages to a target service via the D-Bus system.
- **File Descriptor Passing:** The attack relies on exploiting the file descriptor passing mechanism within D-Bus.
- **Message Sequencing:** The attack involves sending at least two messages in quick succession with file descriptors, where the first message is slightly larger than the maximum read bytes per iteration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must have the ability to run a process on the same system as the vulnerable D-Bus daemon and the target service.
- **D-Bus Communication:** The attacker's process must have the necessary permissions to communicate with the target service over D-Bus.
- **Crafted Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to craft specific D-Bus messages, including those with file descriptors.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue arises when the D-Bus daemon receives multiple messages with file descriptors in quick succession and fails to correctly track them, specifically when messages require multiple reads.
- The incorrect `memmove` operation in `dbus/dbus-message.c` causes file descriptors from different messages to be mixed up, leading to the daemon trying to send the same (already closed) file descriptor, or an incorrect file descriptor, to the target.
- The vulnerability can be exploited on all Unix platforms.
- This is a separate vulnerability from CVE-2014-3532, although both vulnerabilities involve file descriptor passing and lead to similar denial-of-service outcomes.
- The fix for CVE-2014-3533 involves correcting the file descriptor handling logic in `dbus/dbus-message.c` to ensure accurate tracking and prevent the forwarding of invalid file descriptors.
- The bug was addressed in dbus versions 1.6.22 and 1.8.6
