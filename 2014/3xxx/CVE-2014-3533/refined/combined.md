| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=79694#c0)  Alejandro Martínez Suárez    2014-06-05 17:47:55 UTC  ``` This problem is related to file descriptor passing in Unix systems. It affects all versions since this functionality was introduced.  In source file 'dbus/dbus-message.c', 'load_message' function, if we have more than one file descriptors inside the loader and they are from different messages, when we are extracting them to compose the actual message, a misbehaviour uprises.  The problem is with this line (dbus/dbus-message.c:4207) of 1.8.X branch:  memmove(loader->unix_fds + n_unix_fds, loader->unix_fds, loader->n_unix_fds);  It pretends to move the array of FD's after extracting the current message ones, but the command has the source and destination arguments swapped.  Suppose we have two FD's in the loader:   (35,36) loader->n_unix_fds = 2  The message we are composing uses one FD (the 35). We assign it to the message, and after executing the previous command, we end with this info in the loader:   (35,35) loader->n_unix_fds = 1  We should have ended with:   (36, ) loader->n_unix_fds = 1  The problem is that we are duplicating the id of the first file descriptor in the position of the second one. Fix it is simple, we only need to interchange them:  memmove(loader->unix_fds, loader->unix_fds + n_unix_fds, loader->n_unix_fds);  This patch has worked succesfully for me. I have tested it on a Suse 11, and my problems with duplicated file descriptors (because two different messages where sharing the same file descriptor) are finally gone :). ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=79694#c1)  Simon McVittie    2014-06-11 11:20:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=79694#c0)) > Suppose we have two FD's in the loader:  I think this is a potentially dangerous oversimplification, so I'm going to work through the logic with larger numbers.  Suppose we have 5 fds: the first message is meant to contain 2 and the second 3:  n_unix_fds = 2 message has 0 fds {} loader has 5 fds { 11, 12, 21, 22, 23 }  We copy the first 2 fds into the message:  n_unix_fds = 2 message has 2 fds { 11, 12 } loader has 5 fds { 11, 12, 21, 22, 23 }  and what we want to do is to shift unix_fds[2]..unix_fds[4], inclusive, down to unix_fds[0]..unix_fds[2], inclusive.  There are actually *two* bugs here. One is that we're trying to shift [0]..[2] upwards, not the other way round; so you would expect we would get { 11, 12, 21, 11, 12, [heap buffer overflow] }.  The other bug, which is what prevents this from being a buffer overflow, is that we're incorrectly copying loader->n_unix_fds *bytes*, not loader->n_unix_fds *ints*.  (The buffer overflows if      n_unix_fds * 4 + loader->n_unix_fds > max_message_unix_fds * 4  but since we know that n_unix_fds + loader->n_unix_fds <= max_message_unix_fds, that's impossible.

Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3477 CVE-2014-3532 CVE-2014-3533

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in dbus, an asynchronous
inter-process communication system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2014-3477

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered that dbus-daemon sends an
    AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the
    client is prohibited from accessing the service. A local attacker
    could use this flaw to cause a bus-activated service that is not
    currently running to attempt to start, and fail, denying other users
    access to this service.

CVE-2014-3532

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's
    support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force
    system services or user applications to be disconnected from the
    D-Bus system by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,
    leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2014-3533

    Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. and Alejandro Martinez Suarez
    discovered that a malicious process could force services to be
    disconnected from the D-Bus system by causing dbus-daemon to attempt
    to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process, leading to
    a denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.6-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

openSUSE Security Update: dbus-1: update to 1.6.24
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1239-1
Rating: moderate
References: #896453
Cross-References: CVE-2014-3635 CVE-2014-3636 CVE-2014-3637

Affected Products:
openSUSE 12.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes 5 vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
The DBUS-1 service and libraries were updated to upstream release 1.6.24
fixing security issues and bugs.
Upstream changes since dbus 1.6.8
+ Security fixes
- Do not accept an extra fd in the padding of a cmsg message, which
could lead to a 4-byte heap buffer overrun. (CVE-2014-3635,
fdo#83622; Simon McVittie)
- Reduce default for maximum Unix file descriptors passed per message
from 1024 to 16, preventing a uid with the default maximum number of
connections from exhausting the system bus' file descriptors under
Linux's default rlimit. Distributors or system administrators with a
more restrictive fd limit may wish to reduce these limits further.
Additionally, on Linux this prevents a second denial of service in
which the dbus-daemon can be made to exceed the maximum number of
fds per sendmsg() and disconnect the process that would have
received them. (CVE-2014-3636, fdo#82820; Alban Crequy)
- Disconnect connections that still have a fd pending unmarshalling
after a new configurable limit, pending\_fd\_timeout (defaulting to
150 seconds), removing the possibility of creating an abusive
connection that cannot be disconnected by setting up a circular
reference to a connection's file descriptor. (CVE-2014-3637,
fdo#80559; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for maximum pending replies per connection from 8192
to 128, mitigating an algorithmic complexity denial-of-service
attack (CVE-2014-3638, fdo#81053; Alban Crequy)
- Reduce default for authentication timeout on the system bus from 30
seconds to 5 seconds, avoiding denial of service by using up all
unauthenticated connection slots; and when all unauthenticated
connection slots are used up, make new connection attempts block
instead of disconnecting them. (CVE-2014-3639, fdo#80919; Alban
Crequy)
- On Linux >= 2.6.37-rc4, if sendmsg() fails with ETOOMANYREFS,
silently drop the message. This prevents an attack in which a
malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a system service,
which is a local denial of service. (fdo#80163, CVE-2014-3532; Alban
Crequy)
- Track remaining Unix file descriptors correctly when more than one
message in quick succession contains fds. This prevents another
attack which a malicious client can make dbus-daemon disconnect a
system service. (fdo#79694, fdo#80469, CVE-2014-3533; Alejandro
Martínez Suárez, Simon McVittie, Alban Crequy)
- Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered and fixed a
denial-of-service flaw in dbus-daemon, part of the reference
implementation of D-Bus. Additionally, in highly unusual
environments the same flaw could lead to a side channel between
processes that should not be able to communicate. (CVE-2014-3477,
fdo#78979)
- CVE-2013-2168: Fix misuse of va\_list that could be used as a denial
of service for system services. Vulnerability reported by Alexandru
Cornea. (Simon)
+ Other fixes
- Don't leak memory on out-of-memory while listing activatable or
active services (fdo#71526, Radoslaw Pajak)
- fix undefined behaviour in a regression test (fdo#69924, DreamNik)
- path\_namespace='/' in match rules incorrectly matched nothing; it
now matches everything. (fdo#70799, Simon McVittie)
- Make dbus\_connection\_set\_route\_peer\_messages(x, FALSE) behave as
documented. Previously, it assumed its second parameter was TRUE.
(fdo#69165, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a NULL pointer dereference on an unlikely error path (fdo#69327,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- If accept4() fails with EINVAL, as it can on older Linux kernels
with newer glibc, try accept() instead of going into a busy-loop.
(fdo#69026, Chengwei Yang)
- If socket() or socketpair() fails with EINVAL or EPROTOTYPE, for
instance on Hurd or older Linux with a new glibc, try without
SOCK\_CLOEXEC. (fdo#69073; Pino Toscano, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a file descriptor leak on an error code path. (fdo#69182,
Sviatoslav Chagaev)
- Fix compilation if writev() is unavailable (fdo#69409, Vasiliy
Balyasnyy)
- Avoid an infinite busy-loop if a signal interrupts waitpid()
(fdo#68945, Simon McVittie)
- Escape addresses containing non-ASCII characters correctly
(fdo#53499, Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in \_dbus\_string\_init() or similar, don't
free an invalid pointer if the string is later freed (fdo#65959,
Chengwei Yang)
- If malloc() returns NULL in dbus\_set\_error(), don't va\_end() a
va\_list that was never va\_start()ed (fdo#66300, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix a regression test on platforms with strict alignment (fdo#67279,
Colin Walters)
- Avoid calling function parameters "interface" since certain Windows
headers have a namespace-polluting macro of that name (fdo#66493,
Ivan Romanov)
- Make "make -j check" work (fdo#68852, Simon McVittie)
- In dbus-daemon, don't crash if a .service file starts with key=value
(fdo#60853, Chengwei Yang)
- Fix an assertion failure if we try to activate systemd services
before systemd connects to the bus (fdo#50199, Chengwei Yang)
- Avoid compiler warnings for ignoring the return from write()
(Chengwei Yang)
- Following Unicode Corrigendum #9, the noncharacters U+nFFFE,
U+nFFFF, U+FDD0..U+FDEF are allowed in UTF-8 strings again.
(fdo#63072, Simon McVittie)
- Diagnose incorrect use of dbus\_connection\_get\_data() with negative
slot (i.e. before allocating the slot) rather than returning junk
(fdo#63127, Dan Williams)
- In the activation helper, when compiled for tests, do not reset the
system bus address, fixing the regression tests. (fdo#52202, Simon)
- Fix building with Valgrind 3.8, at the cost of causing harmless
warnings with Valgrind 3.6 on some compilers (fdo#55932, Arun
Raghavan)
- Don't leak temporary fds pointing to /dev/null (fdo#56927, Michel
HERMIER)
- Create session.d, system.d directories under CMake (fdo#41319, Ralf
Habacker)
- Include alloca.h for alloca() if available, fixing compilation on
Solaris 10 (fdo#63071, Dagobert Michelsen)

Subject: CVE-2014-3532, -3533: two local DoS vulnerabilities in dbus-daemon

Impact: denial of service (force system services to exit)
Access required: local
Versions affected by CVE-2014-3532: dbus >= 1.3.0 on Linux >= 2.6.37-rc4
Versions affected by CVE-2014-3533: dbus >= 1.3.0 on all Unix platforms

Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's support
for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force system
services or user applications to be disconnected from the D-Bus system
bus by sending them a message containing a file descriptor, then causing
that file descriptor to exceed the kernel's maximum recursion depth
(itself introduced to fix a DoS) before dbus-daemon forwards the message
to the victim process. Most services and applications exit when
disconnected from the system bus, leading to a denial of service. This
is tracked as fd.o#80163 and CVE-2014-3532.

Additionally, Alban discovered that bug fd.o#79694, a bug previously
reported by Alejandro Martínez Suárez which was not believed to be a
security flaw, could be used for a similar denial of service, by causing
dbus-daemon to attempt to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim
process when file descriptors become associated with the wrong message.
Its security implications are tracked as fd.o#80469 and CVE-2014-3533.

For the 1.8.x stable branch, these vulnerabilities are fixed in version
1.8.6. For the 1.6.x old-stable branch, these vulnerabilities are fixed
in version 1.6.22.

All earlier versions of dbus with the file descriptor passing feature
(1.3.0 and up) are believed to be vulnerable. Distributions that
backport security fixes should backport git commits
07f4c12efe3b9bd45d109bc5fbaf6d9dbf69d78e and
9ca90648fc870c24d852ce6d7ce9387a9fc9a94a, attached.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2016

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2016

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98356520554156&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016
* 17 January 2017

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=80469#c0)  Alban Crequy    2014-06-24 09:40:50 UTC  ``` This bug is to discuss the security implications of [Bug #79694](show_bug.cgi?id=79694 "RESOLVED FIXED - Misbehaviour reading a message with passing file descriptors (duplicate/missing fds)") ("Misbehaviour reading a message with passing file descriptors (duplicate/missing fds)").  I can kick any connection off the bus with fdpassing, as long as the malicious program is allowed to send messages to the target.  I tested with this on the system bus: $ ./test79694 com.redhat.PrinterDriversInstaller And the process was terminated.  - The malicious program sends 2 messages to the target:    - Message 1: - contains 2 file descriptors (53 and 54 in the logs)                 - is slightly larger than 2048 bytes so it needs 2 iterations                   to read (*). See max_bytes_read_per_iteration.    - Message 2: - contains 3 file descriptors (61, 62, and 63 in the logs)                 - is a small message  Strace logs of dbus-daemon:  * receive part 1/2 of message 1:  recvmsg(40, {msg_name(0)=NULL,              msg_iov(1)=[{"l\1\1\1\f\10\0\0\2\0\0\0_\0\0\0\t\1u\0\2\0\0\0\10\1g\0\3hhs"..., 2048}],              msg_controllen=24, {cmsg_len=24, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET, cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, {53, 54}},              msg_flags=MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC}, MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC) = 2048 fcntl(53, F_GETFD)                      = 0x1 (flags FD_CLOEXEC) fcntl(53, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)          = 0 fcntl(54, F_GETFD)                      = 0x1 (flags FD_CLOEXEC) fcntl(54, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)          = 0  * receive both part 2/2 of message 1 and message 2 in a single recvmsg() call:  recvmsg(40, {msg_name(0)=NULL, msg_iov(1)=[{"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"..., 2048}],              msg_controllen=32, {cmsg_len=28, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET, cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, {61, 62, 63}},              msg_flags=MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC}, MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC) = 248 fcntl(61, F_GETFD)                      = 0x1 (flags FD_CLOEXEC) fcntl(61, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)          = 0 fcntl(62, F_GETFD)                      = 0x1 (flags FD_CLOEXEC) fcntl(62, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)          = 0 fcntl(63, F_GETFD)                      = 0x1 (flags FD_CLOEXEC) fcntl(63, F_SETFD, FD_CLOEXEC)          = 0  * send message 1 to target. Notice it sends the correct fds and closes them correctly:  sendmsg(36,         {msg_name(0)=NULL,          msg_iov(2)=[{"l\1\1\1\f\10\0\0\2\0\0\0o\0\0\0\t\1u\0\2\0\0\0\10\1g\0\3hhs"..., 128},                      {"\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\377\7\0\0XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"..., 2060}],          msg_controllen=24,          {cmsg_len=24, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET, cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, {53, 54}},           msg_flags=0}, MSG_NOSIGNAL) = 2188 close(53)                               = 0 close(54)                               = 0  * send message 2 to target: due to the bug, it sends the wrong fds (the fds are closed already):  sendmsg(36,         {msg_name(0)=NULL,          msg_iov(2)=[{"l\1\1\1\f\0\0\0\3\0\0\0o\0\0\0\t\1u\0\3\0\0\0\10\1g\0\3hhh"..., 128},                      {"\0\0\0\0\1\0\0\0\2\0\0\0", 12}],          msg_controllen=32,          {cmsg_len=28, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET, cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, {53, 54, 53}},           msg_flags=0}, MSG_NOSIGNAL) = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor)  * Notice that sendmsg() returns -1 EBADF! * Too bad for the innocent target! dbus-daemon kills the connection:  epoll_ctl(4, EPOLL_CTL_DEL, 36, {0, {u32=0, u64=0}}) = 0 close(36)                               = 0  * And closes the wrong fds:  close(53)                               = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor) write(2, "Failed to close file descriptor:"..., 55) = 55 close(54)                               = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor) write(2, "Failed to close file descriptor:"..., 55) = 55 close(53)                               = -1 EBADF (Bad file descriptor) write(2, "Failed to close file descriptor:"..., 55) = 55  => It is an effective way to kill any connection on the bus if the D-Bus      policy and SCMs allow the malicious program to send 2 D-Bus messages to the    target. D-Bus libraries often terminate the program when the D-Bus    connection is closed. So it can kill programs on the bus.  (*): If you wonder why message 1 needs to be bigger than      max_bytes_read_per_iteration, it is because the kernel will not      aggregate the two D-Bus messages in a single recvmsg() call otherwise:      <http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/unix/af_unix.c#L2051>      2051                         if (siocb->scm->fp)      2052                                 break;      and the bug happends only when fds from several D-Bus messages are in      the loader at the same time.  ==========  The patch attached on [Bug #79694](show_bug.cgi?id=79694 "RESOLVED FIXED - Misbehaviour reading a message with passing file descriptors (duplicate/missing fds)") fixes the security issue.  [Bug #80163](show_bug.cgi?id=80163 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2014-3532: kick any connection off the bus with fdpassing: denial of service") is a different bug but has a similar security impact. I suggest fixes for both could be released at the same time. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=80469#c1)  Colin Walters    2014-06-24 12:02:05 UTC  ``` Can you attach the sources for "test79694"? ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=80469#c2)  Simon McVittie    2014-06-26 14:01:32 UTC  ``` If none of the other D-Bus maintainers review my patch for #79694 soon, I will treat Alban's positive review as sufficient for merge, and include it in the same DoS-fix release as [Bug #80163](show_bug.cgi?id=80163 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2014-3532: kick any connection off the bus with fdpassing: denial of service").  (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=80469#c1)) > Can you attach the sources for "test79694"?  Resolved elsewhere: Alban sent this by private email, because this bug is going to become public when unembargoed, and he wanted to err on the side of caution when passing around working exploits. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=80469#c3)  Simon McVittie    2014-07-02 16:07:11 UTC  ``` Removing embargo. Fixed in dbus 1.8.6 and 1.6.22 which I just released. ``` |  |

```
Updated dbus packages fix security vulnerabilities:

A flaw was reported in D-Bus's file descriptor passing feature. A local
attacker could use this flaw to cause a service or application to disconnect
from the bus, typically resulting in that service or application exiting
(CVE-2014-3532).

A flaw was reported in D-Bus's file descriptor passing feature. A local
attacker could use this flaw to cause an invalid file descriptor to be
forwarded to a service or application, causing it to disconnect from the bus,
typically resulting in that service or application exiting (CVE-2014-3533).
