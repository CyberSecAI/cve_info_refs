# CSRF in Member Approval 131109 permits unapproved registrations (WordPress plugin)

*From*: dxw Security <security () dxw com>

```
Details
================
Software: Member Approval
Version: 131109
Homepage: <http://wordpress.org/plugins/member-approval/>
Advisory ID: dxw-1970-1172
CVE: CVE-2014-3850
CVSS: 5.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

Description
================
CSRF in Member Approval 131109 permits unapproved registrations

Vulnerability
================
By convincing a logged-in administrator to visit a link of an attacker’s choosing an attacker can reset the plugin’s
options to the defaults, meaning that registrations will become open to everybody without requiring approval.

Proof of concept
================
By clicking the submit button here, an admin will reset the plugin to the defaults (with some slight modifications
there may be a stored XSS here too, but I did not investigate further):
<form method=\"post\" action=\"<http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=member-approval\">;>
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Note: no admin action is necessary assuming the attacker can persuade an admin to visit a page under their control, as
the form can be submitted using Javascript.

Mitigations
================
Disable the plugin until a fix is available.

================
