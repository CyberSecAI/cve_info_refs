    "ID": "CVE-2014-3976",
    "content": "The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in A10 Networks ACOS version 2.7.0-P2 (Build 53) and possibly older versions. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of user input validation when processing HTTP requests to the administration web server. Specifically, an overly long 'session id' in the request can cause a buffer overflow.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n    - Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow occurs when the web server attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size for the session ID.\n    - Lack of Input Validation: The web server fails to properly validate the length of the 'session id' parameter in the HTTP request.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n    - Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.\n    - Denial of Service (DoS): Unsuccessful exploitation can cause a denial of service of the administrative interface due to the web server crashing.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n    - HTTP Request: The attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web server.\n    - Session ID Parameter: The vulnerability is triggered by providing an overly long session ID parameter in the HTTP request URI.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n    - Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the A10 Networks device in order to send the malicious HTTP requests.\n    - No Authentication Required: The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.\n\nThe provided exploit sends a GET request to a vulnerable endpoint including an overly long session ID in the URL, leading to a crash.  The provided register states after the crash show that registers like `rdi` and `rbp` contain the overflowing 'A' characters, and `rip` is overwritten, indicating code execution is possible.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was discovered by Francesco Perna of Quantum Leap s.r.l. A fix is available in ACOS version 2.7.0-p6 and later."
