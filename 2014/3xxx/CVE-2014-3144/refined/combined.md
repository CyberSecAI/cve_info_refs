How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2263-1: Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

27 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Salva Peiró discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-

device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1739](/security/CVE-2014-1739))

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1450-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1450.69](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1450.69)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Use CVE-2014-3144.

(The _NEST variant was introduced at a later time, but the affected
code is somewhat analogous, and the lack of an skb->len check for the
_NEST variant probably can't be considered an independent mistake
relative to the lack of an skb->len check in the earlier code.)

> The remainder calculation for the BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension is
> also wrong. It has the minuend and subtrahend mixed up

Use CVE-2014-3145.

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-04-13 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

The (1) BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR and (2) BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR\_NEST extension implementations in the sk\_run\_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 do not check whether a certain length value is sufficiently large, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer underflow and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr and \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr\_nest functions before the vulnerability was announced.

See more information about CVE-2014-3144 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3144) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3144)

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3144 CVE-2014-3145 CVE-2014-3153

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:

CVE-2014-3144 / CVE-2014-3145

    A local user can cause a denial of service (system crash) via
    crafted BPF instructions.

CVE-2014-3153

    Pinkie Pie discovered an issue in the futex subsystem that allows a
    local user to gain ring 0 control via the futex syscall. An
    unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel (resulting
    in denial of service) or for privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.57-3+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-65-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-65.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-65.98)

  -
  [3.2.0-65.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-65.98)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-65-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-65.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-65.98)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-65-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-65.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-65.98)
* [linux-image-3.2.0-65-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-65.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-65.98)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Salva Peiró discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-

device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1739](/security/CVE-2014-1739))

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-24.41)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-24.41)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# CVE-2014-3145

* [ULN](https://linux.oracle.com) >
* [Oracle Linux CVE repository](https://linux.oracle.com/cve)  >
* CVE-2014-3145

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-04-13 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

The BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR\_NEST extension implementation in the sk\_run\_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 uses the reverse order in a certain subtraction, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (over-read and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr\_nest function before the vulnerability was announced.

See more information about CVE-2014-3145 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3145) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3145)

filter: prevent nla extensions to peek beyond the end of the message

```
The BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR and BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extensions fail to check
for a minimal message length before testing the supplied offset to be
within the bounds of the message. This allows the subtraction of the nla
header to underflow and therefore -- as the data type is unsigned --
allowing far to big offset and length values for the search of the
netlink attribute.

The remainder calculation for the BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension is
also wrong. It has the minuend and subtrahend mixed up, therefore
calculates a huge length value, allowing to overrun the end of the
message while looking for the netlink attribute.

The following three BPF snippets will trigger the bugs when attached to
a UNIX datagram socket and parsing a message with length 1, 2 or 3.

Fix the first issue by ensuring the message length fulfills the minimal
size constrains of a nla header. Fix the second bug by getting the math
for the remainder calculation right.

# USN-2252-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

20 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-366-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-366.80](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-366.80)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-quantal](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-quantal) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Quantal

## Details

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.5.0-52-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal)
  -
  [3.5.0-52.78~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-52.78~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2261-1: Linux kernel (Saucy HWE) vulnerabilities

27 June 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-saucy](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-saucy) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Saucy

## Details

Salva Peiró discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's media-

device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive

information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1739](/security/CVE-2014-1739))

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the

Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](/security/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem

of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](/security/CVE-2014-3145))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-24.41~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-24-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-24.41~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-24.41~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
