{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The LDAPLoginModule in ActiveMQ's JAAS implementation incorrectly considers authentication successful when an empty password is provided, if the LDAP server supports unauthenticated authentication mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper authentication",
      "Bypass of authentication"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism of an application using LDAPLoginModule and assume the role of any valid user within that application. They can gain unauthorized access and perform actions as a legitimate user. Additionally, the attacker can brute force passwords for valid users when wildcard is provided.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attack over network by providing a valid username with an empty password or supplying a wildcard operator instead of username to brute force a password for unknown valid account"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the application using LDAPLoginModule and a valid username. No prior authentication or special privileges are required."
