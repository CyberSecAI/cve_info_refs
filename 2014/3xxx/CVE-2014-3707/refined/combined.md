| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=901924#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2014-10-20 14:11:05 UTC  ``` libcurl duphandle read out of bounds ====================================  Project cURL Security Advisory, November 5th 2014 - [Permalink](<http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20141105.html>)  VULNERABILITY -------------  libcurl's function [`curl_easy_duphandle()`](<http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html>) has a bug that can lead to libcurl eventually sending off sensitive data that was not intended for sending.  When doing an HTTP POST transfer with libcurl, you can use the `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` option to specify a memory area holding the data to send to the remote server. The memory area's size is set with a separate option, for example `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE`.  As the name implies, the data in the specified buffer is copied to a privately held memory buffer that libcurl allocates on the heap. The memory area is associated with the common CURL handle, often referred to as an "easy handle".  This handle can be duplicated by an application to create an identical copy, and all the already set options and data is then also similarly cloned and will be associated with the newly returned handle. This also includes the data to send in an HTTP POST request.  The internal libcurl function that duplicates options from the old handle to the new, mistakenly treated the post data buffer as if it was a C string. A C string ends with a zero byte, and subsequently strdup() was used to duplicate the post data buffer. A post data buffer can perfectly legitimately contain a zero byte, or it may not contain any zero byte at all (including no trailing one) - leading to strdup() either making a too small duplicate, a too large one or crash due to reading an inaccessible memory area. The strdup() of course allocates memory off the heap.  If strdup finds a zero before the end of the buffer, the copied string ends up shorter than the original buffer but the original buffer size is still kept around. When libcurl subsequently constructs the HTTP POST request and includes data for the protocol body it will memcpy() data from that new pointer using the old size. This makes a read outside of the allocated boundary and can thus lead to libcurl inserting data into the request that happens to be laid out in the heap memory immediately after the post data buffer.  We are not aware of anyone having been able to actually exploit this for nefarious purposes, but we can't exclude that it is possible or even might already have been exploited.  INFO ----  This bug requires `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` and `curl_easy_duphandle()` to be used in that order, and then the duplicate handle must be used to perform the HTTP POST.  The curl tool is not affected, it does not use this sequence.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2014-XXXX to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This bug has existed since `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` was introduced.  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.17.1 to and including 7.38.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.39.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.39.0 makes sure that the buffer area is duplicated and presumed to be binary.  A patch for this problem is available at:       <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-copypostfields-preliminary.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.39.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` then `curl_easy_duphandle()`  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on September 16th 2014.  We contacted distros@openwall on October 20.  libcurl 7.39.0 was released on November 5th 2014, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Reported by Symeon Paraschoudis. Stas Malyshev helped us understand and repeat the problem. Dan Fandrich helped assess the security risk. Patch written by Daniel Stenberg.

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-3707

Symeon Paraschoudis discovered that the curl_easy_duphandle() function
in cURL, an URL transfer library, has a bug that can lead to libcurl
eventually sending off sensitive data that was not intended for sending,
while performing a HTTP POST operation.

This bug requires CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS and curl_easy_duphandle() to be
used in that order, and then the duplicate handle must be used to
perform the HTTP POST. The curl command line tool is not affected by
this problem as it does not use this sequence.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy11.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed in version 7.38.0-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.38.0-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 270 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](//blogs.oracle.com/security).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html) .

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2037108.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2037108.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=911363#c0)  Victor Pereira   2014-12-30 08:18:54 UTC  ``` URL request injection vulnerability ===================================  Project cURL Security Advisory, January 8th 2015 - [Permalink](<http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108B.html>)  VULNERABILITY -------------  When libcurl sends a request to a server via a HTTP proxy, it copies the entire URL into the request and sends if off.  If the given URL contains line feeds and carriage returns those will be sent along to the proxy too, which allows the program to for example send a separate HTTP request injected embedded in the URL.  Many programs allow some kind of external sources to set the URL or provide partial pieces for the URL to ask for, and if the URL as received from the user is not stripped good enough this flaw allows malicious users to do additional requests in a way that was not intended, or just to insert request headers into the request that the program didn't intend.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-XXXX to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.1 to and including 7.39.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.40.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.40.0 makes sure that the URL passed to the proxy may never contain neither carriage returns nor line feeds characters.  A patch for this problem is available (for now) at:       <http://curl.haxx.se/0001-url-parsing-reject-CRLFs-within-URLs.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.40.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Only use URLs that are carefully stripped from line feeds and carriage      returns  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on December 25 2014.  We contacted distros@openwall on December 28.  libcurl 7.40.0 was released on January 8th 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1154941#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-21 05:12:02 UTC  ``` Daniel Stenberg reported the following vulnerability in cURL:  "" libcurl's function curl_easy_duphandle() has a bug that can lead to libcurl eventually sending off sensitive data that was not intended for sending.  When doing an HTTP POST transfer with libcurl, you can use the `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` option to specify a memory area holding the data to send to the remote server. The memory area's size is set with a separate option, for example `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE`.  As the name implies, the data in the specified buffer is copied to a privately held memory buffer that libcurl allocates on the heap. The memory area is associated with the common CURL handle, often referred to as an "easy handle".  This handle can be duplicated by an application to create an identical copy, and all the already set options and data is then also similarly cloned and will be associated with the newly returned handle. This also includes the data to send in an HTTP POST request.  The internal libcurl function that duplicates options from the old handle to the new had two problems:  1. It mistakenly treated the post data buffer as if it was a C string. A C    string ends with a zero byte, and subsequently strdup() was used to    duplicate the post data buffer. A post data buffer can perfectly    legitimately contain a zero byte, or it may not contain any zero byte at    all (including no trailing one) - leading to strdup() either making a too    small duplicate, a too large one or crash due to reading an inaccessible    memory area. The strdup() of course allocates memory off the heap.  2. After duplication of the handle data, the pointer used to read from when    sending the data was not updated. So when sending off the post, libcurl    would still read from the original handle's buffer which at that time could    have been freed or reused for other purposes.  When libcurl subsequently constructs the HTTP POST request and includes data for the protocol body it will memcpy() data from that pointer using the old size and the old pointer. This makes a read from the wrong place and can lead to libcurl inserting data into the request that happens to be stored at that places in memory at that time.  We are not aware of anyone having been able to actually exploit this for nefarious purposes, but we can't exclude that it is possible or even might already have been exploited.  INFO ----  This bug requires `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` and `curl_easy_duphandle()` to be used in that order, and then the duplicate handle must be used to perform the HTTP POST.  The curl tool is not affected, it does not use this sequence. """  This issue affects versions 7.17.1 up to and including 7.38.0. It has been fixed in version 7.39.0  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Symeon Paraschoudis as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1154941#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-21 05:14:16 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 948796](attachment.cgi?id=948796&action=diff "preliminary patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=948796&action=edit "preliminary patch from upstream") preliminary patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154941#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-24 19:45:47 UTC  ``` This issue affects applications that set CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS options on a curl handle a subsequently duplicate the handle (using curl_easy_duphandle()).  During the handle duplication, libcurl may read memory outside of the bounds of allocated buffer if POST data set using CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS was not NUL terminated.  The out of bounds access occurs in strdup()/strlen().  This can cause crash if unmapped memory is reached before NUL byte is found, but such crash is unlikely.  Due to another bug in the handle duplication code, POST data in the copied handle is not used even if no new POST data are set before performing the request.  Instead, data from the buffer associated with the original handle is used.  Therefore, if the original handle is freed, or if new POST data is set on it between duplication and the use of the new handle, libcurl may use data from an already freed buffer.  There are no applications in Red Hat Enterprise Linux that uses libcurl in the way that would make them vulnerable to this issue.  The CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option is only used by PHP, when PHP script sets CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS option with data that is not array or object.  As string arguments used with PHP curl_setopt(CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS) are unlikely to be NUL terminated, strdup() out of bounds read is likely to happen in curl_copy_handle().  Upstream advisory lists curl versions 7.17.1 and later to be affected by this problem.  The version 7.17.1 is the one that introduced the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option.  The curl packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier are based on older upstream curl versions and hence were not affected by this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1154941#c6)  Martin Prpič    2014-11-05 10:47:33 UTC  ``` This issue is now public.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2017

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 252 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2017 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187793594395974id=2310031.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187476629848401id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=187417703460164id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security fixes required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates (CPUs) and Solaris Third Party bulletins.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2017 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2296870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=188252365614599id=2296870.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 22 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 20 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](https:///security-alerts/cpuoct2017verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Low" instead of "High", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 9.6 becomes 7.1.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 8 releases.

#### Notes:

1. This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator).
2. Applies to the Java SE Kerberos client.
3. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1254)

## Topic

Updated curl packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for
downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP,
FTP, and LDAP.

It was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial
literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker able
to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use this flaw
to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other cookie-related
issues easier to exploit. (CVE-2014-3613)

A flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the duplication
of connection handles. If an application set the CURLOPT\_COPYPOSTFIELDS
option for a handle, using the handle's duplicate could cause the
application to crash or disclose a portion of its memory. (CVE-2014-3707)

It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle URLs
with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an
application using libcurl to access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP
proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the request or
construct additional requests. (CVE-2014-8150)

It was discovered that libcurl implemented aspects of the NTLM and
Negotatiate authentication incorrectly. If an application uses libcurl
and the affected mechanisms in a specifc way, certain requests to a
previously NTLM-authenticated server could appears as sent by the wrong
authenticated user. Additionally, the initial set of credentials for HTTP
Negotiate-authenticated requests could be reused in subsequent requests,
although a different set of credentials was specified. (CVE-2015-3143,
CVE-2015-3148)

Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these issues.

Bug fixes:

* An out-of-protocol fallback to SSL version 3.0 (SSLv3.0) was available

with libcurl. Attackers could abuse the fallback to force downgrade of the
SSL version. The fallback has been removed from libcurl. Users requiring
this functionality can explicitly enable SSLv3.0 through the libcurl API.
(BZ#1154059)

* A single upload transfer through the FILE protocol opened the destination

file twice. If the inotify kernel subsystem monitored the file, two events
were produced unnecessarily. The file is now opened only once per upload.
(BZ#883002)

* Utilities using libcurl for SCP/SFTP transfers could terminate

unexpectedly when the system was running in FIPS mode. (BZ#1008178)

* Using the "--retry" option with the curl utility could cause curl to

terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now, adding "--retry" no
longer causes curl to crash. (BZ#1009455)

* The "curl --trace-time" command did not use the correct local time when

printing timestamps. Now, "curl --trace-time" works as expected.
(BZ#1120196)

* The valgrind utility could report dynamically allocated memory leaks on

curl exit. Now, curl performs a global shutdown of the NetScape Portable
Runtime (NSPR) library on exit, and valgrind no longer reports the memory
leaks. (BZ#1146528)

* Previously, libcurl returned an incorrect value of the

CURLINFO\_HEADER\_SIZE field when a proxy server appended its own headers to
the HTTP response. Now, the returned value is valid. (BZ#1161163)

Enhancements:

* The "--tlsv1.0", "--tlsv1.1", and "--tlsv1.2" options are available for

specifying the minor version of the TLS protocol to be negotiated by NSS.
The "--tlsv1" option now negotiates the highest version of the TLS protocol
supported by both the client and the server. (BZ#1012136)

* It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable the ECC and the new

AES cipher suites to be used for TLS. (BZ#1058767, BZ#1156422)

All curl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for curl
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0248-1
Rating: moderate
References: #901924 #911363
Cross-References: CVE-2014-3707 CVE-2014-8150
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
was updated to version 7.40.0 to fix two security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2014-8150: CRLF injection vulnerability in libcurl 6.0 through 7.x
before 7.40.0, when using an HTTP proxy, allowed remote attackers to
inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting
attacks via CRLF sequences in a URL (bnc#911363).
- CVE-2014-3707: The curl\_easy\_duphandle function in libcurl 7.17.1
through 7.38.0, when running with the CURLOPT\_COPYPOSTFIELDS option, did
not properly copy HTTP POST data for an easy handle, which triggered an
out-of-bounds read that allowed remote web servers to read sensitive
memory information (bnc#901924).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- http\_digest: Added support for Windows SSPI based authentication
- version info: Added Kerberos V5 to the supported features
- Makefile: Added VC targets for WinIDN
- SSL: Add PEM format support for public key pinning
- smtp: Added support for the conversion of Unix newlines during mail send
- smb: Added initial support for the SMB/CIFS protocol
- Added support for HTTP over unix domain sockets,
- via CURLOPT\_UNIX\_SOCKET\_PATH and --unix-socket
- sasl: Added support for GSS-API based Kerberos V5 authentication
Patch Instructions:

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**
