| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-10-06 08:27:28 UTC  ``` It was reported that sddm has several issues leading to local privilege escalation:  [1]  The xauth cookie handling code calls xauth binary via popen() as root, which in turn dumps and creates files as root in users ~.  [2]  After xauth has done its job, sddm chowns() the ~/.Xauthority file to user. This is a race and a local root exploit.  [3]  The .xsession-errors file is created in ~ but as root. This allows to destroy arbitrary system files.  Upstream patch is at [4].  [1] <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=897788#c7> [2] <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=897788#c8> [3] <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=897788#c9> [4] <https://github.com/sddm/sddm/pull/280>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-10-06 09:44:06 UTC  ```  Created sddm tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1149629](show_bug.cgi?id=1149629 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-7272 sddm: several local privileges escalation issues [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c2)  Fedora Blocker Bugs Application    2014-10-22 02:26:19 UTC  ``` Proposed as a Freeze Exception for 21-beta by Fedora user rdieter using the blocker tracking app because:   local privilege escalation security issue, associated bodhi update has requisite karma.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c3)  Adam Williamson    2014-10-22 18:16:00 UTC  ``` Discussed at 2014-10-22 freeze exception review meeting: <http://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/fedora-blocker-review/2014-10-22/f21-blocker-review.2014-10-22-16.03.log.txt> . Accepted as a freeze exception issue - obviously, privescs in a release-blocking desktop's login manager are V. Bad. It'd be good to have a fix for this ASAP.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c4)  Kevin Kofler    2014-10-22 21:28:24 UTC  ``` The fix is already queued for stable as FEDORA-2014-12442, it just wants to be pulled in.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c5)  Kevin Kofler    2014-10-23 00:43:59 UTC  ``` There's a caveat however: fedora-livecd-kde-base.ks does this: # set up autologin for user liveuser sed -i 's/^AutoUser=.*/AutoUser=liveuser/' /etc/sddm.conf  This needs updating when/if FEDORA-2014-12242 hits, for 2 reasons: 1. AutoUser= is not the syntax for the latest sddm, it now uses User= in an [Autologin] group. 2. There is no default /etc/sddm.conf shipped anymore on which one could run sed. IMHO, this is very user-unfriendly. The package should ship a default config file that users can edit. But the kickstart could probably just use cat instead of sed for now.  Martin Bříza, can you please update the master branch of spin-kickstarts with the new logic ASAP, or tell me what to put in there, so we have something to cherry-pick? Rawhide already has the new SDDM, so this should have already happened! (There's no way autologin is working on Rawhide KDE live images right now.)  Is this enough? cat >/etc/sddm.conf <<EOF [Autologin] User=liveuser EOF Or do we have to generate a complete config file?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c6)  Martin Bříza    2014-10-23 10:30:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 949792](attachment.cgi?id=949792&action=diff "Patch for spin-kickstarts") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=949792&action=edit "Patch for spin-kickstarts") Patch for spin-kickstarts  Seems I can't push to spin-kickstarts - here is a patch that should fix the problem   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c7)  Adam Williamson    2014-10-23 18:03:37 UTC  ``` applied to master.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c8)  Adam Williamson    2014-10-23 18:44:19 UTC  ``` now fixed on master - mbriza, you can't use EOF there, because you're nested within the "cat >> /etc/rc.d/init.d/livesys << EOF" . You have to use something else - see how the other blocks use MENU_EOF, AKONADI_EOF, etc etc. I changed it to use SDDM_EOF.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c9)  Adam Williamson    2014-10-23 19:14:39 UTC  ``` I built alive image with the new sddm and mbriza's patch to spin-kickstarts. It black screens on boot. /var/log/sddm.log has:  (EE) DAEMON: Failed to find command for session: "plasma.desktop"   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c10)  Fedora Update System    2014-10-28 06:46:57 UTC  ``` sddm-0.9.0-2.20141007git6a28c29b.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c11)  Adam Williamson    2014-10-28 06:49:34 UTC  ``` Whoops, forgot to note that I fixed c#9.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c12)  Adam Williamson    2014-10-30 19:18:21 UTC  ``` Setting ON_QA for F21, we pulled the updated sddm into Beta.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c13)  Adam Williamson    2014-10-30 19:26:40 UTC  ``` VERIFIED at least that the updated version is in Beta RC4 and works correctly.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1149610#c14)  Adam Williamson    2014-11-03 23:47:42 UTC  ``` The updated sddm was pushed stable.

This avoids it being created as root and then chown'd.

Open for discussion, I know it's not by all means clean code.

Sorry, something went wrong.

As far as we can tell, the vendor considers it a vulnerability for
unauthenticated logins as sddm to succeed, so we'll assign
CVE-2014-7271. The conditions under which this can happen are not
clear; maybe one or more of these is true:

  - sddm is a regular user account, not a uid-below-1000 account, on
    some systems because a Linux distribution is allowed to customize
    the sddm account name in its own sddm package

  - sddm is a regular user account, not a uid-below-1000 account, on
    some systems because that username was in use before sddm was
    installed

  - there's a way to choose to login as sddm even if sddm isn't on the
    list of users

> <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=897788#c7>
> <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=897788#c8>
> <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=897788#c9>
> <https://github.com/sddm/sddm/pull/280>

Apparently the primary problem is unsafe write operations into a
directory that's completely controlled by a unprivileged user. (The
chown is, in some sense, a write operation on security-relevant file
metadata.) Use CVE-2014-7272 for all of these three.
