 "cveId": "CVE-2014-7817",
 "description": "The wordexp() function will perform command substitution even when the WRDE_NOCMD flag was specified. An attacker able to provide specially crafted input to an application using the wordexp() function, and not sanitizing the input correctly, could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with the credentials of the user running that application.",
 "vulnerabilityDetails": {
  "rootCause": "The wordexp() function in glibc would perform command substitution even when explicitly told not to, when expanding \"$((`...`))\".",
  "weakness": "The wordexp() function fails to properly handle the WRDE_NOCMD flag when processing arithmetic inputs in the form of \"$((... ``))\" where \"...\" can be anything valid.",
  "impact": "This can allow a local authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the credentials of a process calling wordexp() on an attacker-supplied data.",
  "attackVector": "An attacker able to provide specially crafted input to an application using the wordexp() function, and not sanitizing the input correctly",
  "attackerCapabilities": "local authenticated attacker"
