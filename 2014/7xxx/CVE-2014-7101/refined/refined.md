      "Improper validation of the SSL chain, failing to verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).",
      "Use of vulnerable libraries that may be used by multiple applications."

    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, allowing them to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.",
