    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates in SSL/TLS connections.",
      "Failure to validate the SSL chain against a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network may perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the Android device."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
      "Ability to intercept and modify network traffic."

     "testing_methodology": "CERT Tapioca was used to test applications, as described in the CERT/CC blog.",
