The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7088.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure that the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify that a server's certificate was issued by a trusted CA.
- Reliance on potentially untrusted or compromised certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
- Viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential theft.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- Interception of network traffic between the Android device and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network communications.
- Positioned on the same network as the victim's device (e.g., via a compromised Wi-Fi access point).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is provided which lists affected applications and whether fixes are available.
- The vulnerability can be tested using the CERT Tapioca tool.
- The provided CVSS score indicates a high severity vulnerability.
