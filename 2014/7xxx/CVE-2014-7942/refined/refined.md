  "CVE-2014-7942": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The fonts implementation did not initialize memory for a data structure correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "root cause",
        "description": "The root cause of the vulnerability is an uninitialized-value in the Fonts component of the Chromium browser, specifically a failure to properly initialize memory for a data structure."
      },

        "type": "vulnerability",
         "description": "The weakness is an uninitialized-value, which leads to memory corruption."

         "type":"impact",
        "description": "The impact of exploitation could range from a denial-of-service (renderer crash) to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. An attacker could potentially execute code within the browser's context, giving them access to potentially sensitive data or the ability to take further malicious actions."
