The provided text is a commit message that fixes two CVEs, CVE-2014-7912 and CVE-2014-7913. 
Here's the analysis for CVE-2014-7913 based on this commit message:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `get_option()` function reads past the end of the option buffer, causing a buffer over-read.
- The `print_option()` function uses `snprintf()` without proper bounds checking on the output buffer, potentially causing a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer over-read:** In `get_option()`, reading past the boundary of the option buffer.
- **Buffer overflow:** In `print_option()`, the use of `snprintf` without ensuring the output buffer is large enough.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A buffer over-read could potentially leak sensitive information or cause a crash.
- A buffer overflow can lead to code execution, denial of service, or other security issues.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability exists within the DHCP client daemon code. An attacker would need to provide a crafted DHCP response containing a malicious option to trigger the buffer over-read in `get_option()` or cause an overflow when printing it with `print_option()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position to send a malicious DHCP response to the affected device. This typically means being on the same network as the device.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific DHCP option that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Notes:**

The commit message also mentions that the DHCP client daemon code is not easily refactored into a library, and direct inclusion of header files is difficult due to the use of C++ reserved keywords ("new") for variable names within structures.
The commit also includes a small unit test to verify the fix for the buffer over-read issue.
