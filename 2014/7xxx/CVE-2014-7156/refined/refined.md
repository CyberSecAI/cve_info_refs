  "vulnerability_details": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-7156",
    "description": "The emulation of instructions which generate software interrupts fails to perform supervisor mode permission checks. Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the guest.",
    "root_cause": "Missing privilege level checks in x86 emulation of software interrupts.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The emulator fails to perform supervisor mode permission checks when emulating instructions that generate software interrupts."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious HVM guest user mode code can potentially crash the guest.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation requires the use of instructions that generate software interrupts within an HVM guest environment.",
          "The vulnerability is triggered in specific scenarios:",
        "When a memory operand is in memory-mapped I/O space.",
        "In 32-bit PAE mode, when such instruction is near a page table update.",
        "When a guest alters an instruction to be one of the affected ones, following an Invalid Opcode exception.",
        "When the guest is in real mode."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires the ability to execute code within an HVM guest. Specifically user mode code is enough for exploitation.",
      "affected_systems": "Xen versions from 3.3 onwards are vulnerable."
