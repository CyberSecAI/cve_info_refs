You need a Google API key to install. The documentation on how to do this is outdated. So I never could figure out how to get the API key so I never installed this plugin.

We followed instructions to a T, I thought, and yet our Google calendar did not show on the website via the plugin. It turns out, although we had the main calendar itself set as public, each individual event was set as private, so nothing showed.
The instructions ought to mention that each individual event must be set to public (or default), as that can be overlooked, as in our case.
Also, there are some settings in the Google Console that are not mentioned at all in the plugin instructions, and it can be confusing. For example, Google tells you via a note in the Console that you should set up OAuth. It’s not necessary for this plugin, though. But something should be said to indicate that, since Google seems to be saying it is necessary.
