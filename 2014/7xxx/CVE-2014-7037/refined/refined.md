Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#582497, which is related to CVE-2014-7037:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper SSL certificate validation:** The applications do not correctly verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain. This includes not checking if the certificate is signed by a trusted CA.
*   **Lack of adherence to secure coding practices:** The document references  "DRD19-J. Properly verify server certificate on SSL/TLS" from the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java, highlighting a failure to follow established secure coding guidelines.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** Attackers on the same network as the Android device can intercept and modify network traffic meant to be protected by HTTPS.
*   **Credential theft:** Attackers can steal user credentials if the application transmits sensitive information.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** In some cases, a successful MITM attack could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the device. This impact varies greatly depending on the application.
*   **Data Exposure**: Sensitive information transmitted by the app could be exposed.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based attack:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be a public Wi-Fi network or any network controlled by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network proximity:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server it communicates with.
*   **MITM capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which involves intercepting and potentially modifying communications between two parties.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is widespread, affecting numerous Android applications.
*   The CERT/CC used a tool called CERT Tapioca to test the applications.
*   A spreadsheet is maintained that tracks affected applications and the availability of fixes.
*   The document mentions that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took action against Fandango and Credit Karma for similar issues, indicating the real-world impact of these vulnerabilities.
