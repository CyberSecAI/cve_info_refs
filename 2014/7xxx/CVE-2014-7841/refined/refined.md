Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-7841:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** A flaw in the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation during Address Configuration Change (ASCONF) processing. Specifically, a malformed INIT chunk could lead to a NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation and handling of parameters within ASCONF chunks, particularly with the SET\_PRIMARY\_IP parameter.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote attackers can send a specially crafted SCTP packet.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to send a specially crafted SCTP packet to the vulnerable system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  A successful exploit can cause a denial of service (system crash). The crash is due to a NULL pointer dereference.
*   **More details:** Some sources specify that the crafted packet exploits the function `sctp_process_param` within `net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c`. Also, the root cause is that nested parameters such as an address parameter inside of the 'set primary IP address' parameter aren't validated correctly. This causes `sctp_get_af_specific()` to return `NULL` which is then dereferenced unconditionally.

**2. Affected Systems:**

*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions up to 3.17.2 and 3.17.4
*   Multiple Linux distributions are affected, including:
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP3, 12, 12 SP1
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension 11 SP3
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time 11 SP3
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1-LTSS, 11 SP2-LTSS, 11 SP3, 11 SP4, 12, 12 SP1,  and 12 SP4 (LTSS, ESPOS)
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 (and related variants like AUS and EUS)
    *   Oracle Linux 5, 6 and 7.
    *   openSUSE
    *   Debian (wheezy, and sid).

**3. Patch Information:**

*   Patches have been issued by the respective Linux distributions to address the vulnerability.
*   The upstream fix is available at:
    `https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/davem/net.git/commit/?id=e40607cbe270a9e8360907cb1e62ddf0736e4864`

**5. Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Liu Wei of Red Hat.
*   SUSE's security team notes that not all CVEs in the Linux kernel will be fixed, and that some bug classes may be marked as "won't fix."
*   Red Hat also mentions another commit: `https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=e40607cbe270a9e8360907cb1e62ddf0736e4864`
*   Red Hat Bugzilla also references multiple other bugs that were dependencies to fix this specific CVE, suggesting the fix required fixing other related issues.

**Summary of extracted information:**

CVE-2014-7841 is a remotely exploitable vulnerability in the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation that could lead to a system crash due to a NULL pointer dereference. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of nested parameters inside ASCONF chunks, allowing remote attackers to exploit it using specifically crafted SCTP packets. Various Linux distributions were affected, and patches have been made available to address the issue.
