The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7604.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications. This is a violation of secure coding practices (specifically DRD19-J).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This allows the attacker to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. Consequences can range from credential stealing to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the victim. They need to be capable of intercepting network traffic.
