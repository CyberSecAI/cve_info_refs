- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin exposes two AJAX functions (`wp_ajax_nopriv_do_insert` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_do_edit`) to anonymous users using the `nopriv` method, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure AJAX function exposure:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to call AJAX functions designed for form creation and editing.
    - **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  By manipulating form content through the exposed AJAX functions, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database and executed when the form is viewed.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Persistent XSS:** Execution of malicious JavaScript in the victim's browser when viewing a manipulated form, leading to potential account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    - **Website defacement:**  Modification of website content, leading to a compromised appearance.
    - **Malware injection:** Injection of malicious scripts or iframes that can redirect users to malware download sites or execute other harmful actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Remote attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over HTTP via the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need any credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site to send HTTP requests.
