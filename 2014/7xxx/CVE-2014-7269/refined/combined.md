## Description

Multiple wireless LAN routers provided by ASUS JAPAN Inc. contain an OS command injection vulnerability.

## Impact

An arbitrary OS command may be executed by an authenticated attacker.

In addition, when this vulnerability is exploited along with the vulnerability stated in [JVN#32631078](/en/jp/JVN32631078/), an arbitrary OS command may be executed if a logged in user views a malicious page.

## Solution

**Update the Firmware**
Apply the appropriate firmware update provided by the developer.

## Vendor Status

## Vulnerability Analysis by JPCERT/CC

**Analyzed on 2015.01.27 (CVSS Base Metrics)**

[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with adjacent network access requires the attacker to have access to either the broadcast or collision domain of the vulnerable software. |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | The vulnerability requires an attacker to be logged into the system (such as at a command line or via a desktop session or web interface). |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | Modification of some system files or information is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what can be modified, or the scope of what the attacker can affect is limited. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability. |

Base Score:5.2

## Comment

This analysis assumes that the authenticated attacker executes an OS command.
