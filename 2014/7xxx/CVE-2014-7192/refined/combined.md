To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Security vulnerabilities have been discovered in the syntax-error and qs modules packaged in the IBM SDK for Node.js and Cordova platform packaged in IBM Rational Application Developer.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2014-7191](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7191)

**Description:** Node.js is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an error in the qs module when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to block the event loop for an extended period of time and cause a denial of service.

**CVSS Base Score:** 5

**CVEID:** [CVE-2014-7192](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7192)

**Description:** A vulnerability in the Node.js syntax-error module could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the improper validation of input prior to being used in an eval() call. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject and execute arbitrary script on the system.

**CVSS Base Score:** 7.5

**CVSS Temporal Score:** See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96728> for the current score

**CVSS Environmental Score\*:** Undefined

**CVSS Vector:** (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
