Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7814:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine exposed SQL filters via the REST API without proper input escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An authenticated user could exploit the vulnerability to perform SQL injection attacks against the CloudForms Management Engine database. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the REST API of the CloudForms Management Engine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CloudForms Management Engine to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in the CloudForms Management Engine's REST API, which incorrectly handles SQL filters by not sanitizing user inputs, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability. Successful exploitation can have a high impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the data in the CloudForms Management Engine database. The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
