    "CVE-2014-7863": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The `FailOverHelperServlet` in ManageEngine OpManager, Applications Manager and IT360 is vulnerable to arbitrary file download and directory content disclosure due to insufficient input validation.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Arbitrary file download vulnerability",
          "Information disclosure - directory listing"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server and list the contents of directories. This could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information and configuration files.",
        "attack_vectors": "By sending specially crafted POST requests to `/servlet/FailOverHelperServlet` with the `operation` parameter set to `copyfile` and `fileName` for file download or `listdirectory` and `rootDirectory` for directory listing.",
        "required_capabilities": "Unauthenticated access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerabilities in OpManager and AppManager. However, authentication is required for IT360."
