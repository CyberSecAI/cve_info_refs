```
Root cause of vulnerability:
    - The `JBossMappingManager` implementation, when processing undefined security domains, would fall back to the default security domain if available. This could result in a user with valid credentials in the default domain, and having a role valid in an expected application domain, performing actions not intended for them.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
    - Improper security domain handling
    - Vulnerability present in `org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager` implementation.
    - SAML2 STS Login Module vulnerability due to the PicketLink Trust SecurityActions implementation using a hardcoded default value for the context.

Impact of exploitation:
    - Unauthorized actions could be performed by an authenticated user.
    - Possible privilege escalation depending on the security context and valid roles.

Attack vectors:
    - By authenticating against the default domain and having a valid role in the expected application domain, an attacker could perform actions otherwise restricted.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Authenticated user within a default security domain with a role valid in another application domain.
