```
Based on the provided descriptions and associated bug reports, the content is relevant to CVE-2014-7811.

```
Guideline 4: For relevant content, extract:
   - Root cause of vulnerability
   - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
   - Impact of exploitation
   - Attack vectors
   - Required attacker capabilities/position
```
**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of XML data processed by the REST API in Spacewalk and Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite, which allows embedding arbitrary HTML and script content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist due to the lack of proper input sanitization when processing XML data via the REST API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow a remote authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML, potentially leading to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the web interface
- Data exfiltration
- Other malicious activities by hijacking the administrator's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting malicious XML data containing embedded HTML and/or JavaScript and sending it via the REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Spacewalk or RHN Satellite system.
- Network access to the vulnerable server.
