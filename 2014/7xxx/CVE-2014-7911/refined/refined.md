{
  "CVE-2014-7911": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a missing check in `java.io.ObjectInputStream` in Android versions prior to 5.0. It did not verify if the object being deserialized was actually serializable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure deserialization",
      "Missing validation of serializable interface during deserialization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause an instance of any class with a non-private parameterless constructor to be created. Furthermore, all fields of that instance can be set to arbitrary values, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the system_service. This can then lead to privilege escalation as system_service runs with UID 1000 and can change into the context of any app, install new applications with arbitrary permissions etc. System service is used by all other apps.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted serialized object via Intents with attached Bundles, which are transferred as arraymap Parcels. An Android app can send this malicious data to the system_service, which uses `ObjectInputStream` to deserialize it.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create and send a malicious serialized object through Intents. This can be achieved by creating a malicious Android application. The attacker also needs knowledge of a suitable class with a finalize method to exploit."
