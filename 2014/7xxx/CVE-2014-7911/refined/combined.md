# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2014-7911: Android <5.0 Privilege Escalation using ObjectInputStream

---

*From*: Jann Horn <jann () thejh net>

*Date*: Wed, 19 Nov 2014 02:31:15 +0100

---

```
In Android <5.0, java.io.ObjectInputStream did not check whether the Object that
is being deserialized is actually serializable. That issue was fixed in Android
5.0 with this commit:
<[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/738c833d38d41f8f76eb7e77ab39add82b1ae1e2](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/%2B/738c833d38d41f8f76eb7e77ab39add82b1ae1e2)>

This means that when ObjectInputStream is used on untrusted inputs, an attacker
can cause an instance of any class with a non-private parameterless constructor
to be created. All fields of that instance can be set to arbitrary values. The
malicious object will then typically either be ignored or cast to a type to
which it doesn't fit, implying that no methods will be called on it and no data
from it will be used. However, when it is collected by the GC, the GC will call
the object's finalize method.

The android system_service runs under uid 1000 and can change into the context
of any app, install new applications with arbitrary permissions and so on. Apps
can talk to it using Intents with attached Bundles, Bundles are transferred as
arraymap Parcels and arraymap Parcels can contain serialized data. This means
that any app can attack the system_service this way.

The class android.os.BinderProxy contains a finalize method that calls into
native code. This native code will then use the values of two fields of type
int/long (depends on the Android version), cast them to pointers and follow
them. On Android 4.4.3, this is where one of those pointers ends up. r0
contains the attacker-supplied pointer, and if the attacker can insert data
into the process at a known address, he ends up gaining arbitrary code
execution in system_server:

    # attacker controls pointer in r0
0000d1c0 <android::RefBase::decStrong(void const*) const>:
    d1c0:       b570            push    {r4, r5, r6, lr}
    d1c2:       4605            mov     r5, r0
    d1c4:       6844            ldr     r4, [r0, #4]   # attacker controls r4
    d1c6:       460e            mov     r6, r1
    d1c8:       4620            mov     r0, r4
    d1ca:       f7fd e922       blx     a410 <android_atomic_dec@plt>
    d1ce:       2801            cmp     r0, #1
    d1d0:       d10b            bne.n   d1ea
<android::RefBase::decStrong(void const*) const+0x2a>
    d1d2:       68a0            ldr     r0, [r4, #8]   # attacker controls r0
    d1d4:       4631            mov     r1, r6
    d1d6:       6803            ldr     r3, [r0, #0]   # attacker controls r3
    d1d8:       68da            ldr     r2, [r3, #12]  # attacker controls r2
    d1da:       4790            blx     r2             # jump into attacker-controlled r2 pointer

Android does have ASLR, but like all apps, system_server is forked from the
zygote process - in other words, all apps have the same basic memory layout as
system_server and should therefore be able to circumvent system_server's ASLR.

Here's my crash PoC code. Put it in an android app, install that app, open it.
If nothing happens, the GC might be taking its time - try doing other stuff or
reopening the PoC app or so. Your device should do something like a reboot
after a few seconds.
