      "root_cause": "The `changeRefCountImpl` function in `AudioPolicyManagerBase.cpp` uses the `stream` argument as an index into the `mRefCount` array without validating if the index is within the array's bounds.",

        "Out-of-bounds write",

      "impact": "An attacker can achieve a limited write primitive, incrementing the value at an arbitrary memory location (relative to an `AudioOutputDescriptor` object) by one. When combined with the read primitive in the isStreamActive function (CVE-2014-7920) this allows for arbitrary code execution within the mediaserver process",
