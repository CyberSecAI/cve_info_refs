The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7608.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This occurs because the applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, applications are not correctly verifying the SSL/TLS certificate chain.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially allowing them to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack on the network, where the attacker intercepts and modifies communication between the Android device and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device, allowing them to intercept the network traffic. This includes being on a shared network, especially untrusted networks such as public Wi-Fi.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
- The CERT/CC used a tool called "CERT Tapioca" to identify vulnerable applications.
- A spreadsheet was maintained to track vulnerable applications and their status.
- The vulnerability is also documented in the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java.
