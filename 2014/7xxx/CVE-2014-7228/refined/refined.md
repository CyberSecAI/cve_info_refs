Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-7228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `restore.php` script of Akeeba Kickstart (used by Joomla! and Akeeba Backup products) which is used to extract backup archives and Joomla! update packages. The core issue is that the script does not properly sanitize/authenticate input while processing an archive, and it fails to properly validate the cryptographic key needed to decrypt incoming commands when the restoration.php file exists. This allows an attacker to bypass encryption and send arbitrary commands to the `restore.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Encryption Bypass:** The script fetches parameters from `$_REQUEST`, then empties `$_REQUEST` array, but GET and POST parameters are still available through `$_GET` and `$_POST` variables. The script then decrypts a JSON string parameter and populates the `$_REQUEST` with its content.  By leaving the JSON string empty, an attacker can bypass the encryption mechanism and send unencrypted commands.

2.  **PHP Object Injection (POI):**  The `restore.php` script uses the `unserialize()` function on a user-controlled parameter, `factory`. An attacker can inject a crafted, serialized PHP object, leading to potential control flow manipulation.

3.  **Unvalidated File Operations:**  The injected object can control which archive file is extracted via the `archiveList` property in `AKAbstractUnarchiver`. This, in conjunction with the `fopen()` function call in `__wakeup()`, allows an attacker to specify a remote URL, potentially leading to arbitrary file extraction from a remote location.

4.  **Path Disclosure:** The application returns a serialized object as part of the response which includes a path to a directory. An attacker can force a path disclosure by manipulating the `kickstart.setup.destdir` within the injected object to an empty string and receiving the document root path in the serialized response.

5.  **Missing CSRF Protection:** The Joomla! update mechanism is vulnerable to CSRF, allowing a persistent `restoration.php` file to be created which opens the door for exploitation of the vulnerability in Akeeba Kickstart.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can cause the server to download and extract a malicious archive from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution.
-   **Full Site Compromise:** The ability to execute arbitrary code enables the attacker to potentially take complete control over the targeted web server.
-   **Data Exfiltration:** Injected code can also be used to exfiltrate data or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Direct Request to vulnerable `restore.php`:** The attacker crafts a malicious request to the `restore.php` file using GET or POST parameters, bypassing the encryption and including the serialized PHP object.
-   **Social Engineering:**  The attack relies on a targeted window of opportunity during a legitimate update process, or a CSRF against a logged-in administrator to make the attack persistent.
-   **Timing Window:** The attacker must perform the attack while the `restoration.php` file exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Advanced PHP Knowledge:** The attacker needs advanced knowledge of PHP to craft the malicious serialized object and exploit the vulnerability.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
-   **Timing (or CSRF):** The attacker needs to either time their attack within the short period of time an update operation takes or abuse a CSRF to make the attack persistent.
-  **Server with URL fopen() wrappers**: The server needs to have `allow_url_fopen` enabled in PHP
-  **Server which allows direct file writes**: The server needs to have permissions to write files.

This vulnerability is more severe than the official CVE description suggests. The provided content indicates that exploitation can lead to full remote code execution, depending on the server settings and the attacker's ability to time their attack or leverage a CSRF attack.
