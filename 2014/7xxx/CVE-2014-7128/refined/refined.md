The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7128.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation. Applications are not verifying the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure the server's identity.
- Lack of secure transmission of sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker on the same network can intercept, view, or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential theft.
- Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. An attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- MITM attack enabled by the lack of SSL certificate validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device, often achieved through a rogue Wi-Fi access point or compromised network infrastructure.
