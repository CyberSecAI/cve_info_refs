# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

# swift 1.4.8-0ubuntu2.5 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
swift (1.4.8-0ubuntu2.5) precise-security; urgency=medium

  [ Marc Deslauriers ]
  * SECURITY UPDATE: metadata constraint bypass via multiple requests
    - debian/patches/CVE-2014-7960.patch: add metadata checks to
      swift/account/server.py, swift/common/constraints.py,
      swift/common/db.py, swift/container/server.py, added tests to
      test/unit/common/test_db.py,
      test/functionalnosetests/test_account.py,
      test/functionalnosetests/test_container.py.
    - CVE-2014-7960

  [ Jamie Strandboge ]
  * debian/patches/CVE-2014-7960.patch:
    - adjust unittests since we use webob.exc and not the newer swob
    - adjust functional tests to properly skip if test environment is not
      specified and to not interfere with other functional tests
  * debian/control: Build-Depends on python-mock

## Binary packages built by this source

[python-swift](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/python-swift):
distributed virtual object store - Python libraries

OpenStack Object Storage (code-named Swift) is open source software for

 creating redundant, scalable object storage using clusters of standardized

 servers to store petabytes of accessible data. It is not a file system or

 real-time data storage system, but rather a long-term storage system for a

 more permanent type of static data that can be retrieved, leveraged, and then

 updated if necessary. Primary examples of data that best fit this type of

 storage model are virtual machine images, photo storage, email storage and

 backup archiving. Having no central "brain" or master point of control

 provides greater scalability, redundancy and permanence.

 .

 Objects are written to multiple hardware devices in the data center, with

 the OpenStack software responsible for ensuring data replication and

 integrity across the cluster. Storage clusters can scale horizontally by

 adding new nodes. Should a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its

 content from other active nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to

 ensure data replication and distribution across different devices,

 inexpensive commodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more

 expensive equipment.

 .

 This package provides the Python libraries that actually implement

 everything.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0835)

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
deployment.

A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in OpenStack Object Storage
(swift). By adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user
could bypass the max\_meta\_count constraint, and store more metadata than
allowed by the configuration. (CVE-2014-7960)

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 7 runs on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.1.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-swift security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0836)

## Topic

Updated openstack-swift packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Object Storage (swift) provides object storage in virtual
containers, which allows users to store and retrieve files (arbitrary
data). The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;
redundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data
replication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual
consistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center
deployment.

A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in OpenStack Object Storage
(swift). By adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user
could bypass the max\_meta\_count constraint, and store more metadata than
allowed by the configuration. (CVE-2014-7960)

All users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the
OpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 6 runs on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.6.

# USN-2704-1: Swift vulnerabilities

6 August 2015

Several security issues were fixed in Swift.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.04](/security/notices?release=vivid)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [swift](/security/cves?package=swift) - OpenStack distributed virtual object store

## Details

Rajaneesh Singh discovered Swift does not properly enforce metadata

limits. An attacker could abuse this issue to store more metadata than

allowed by policy. ([CVE-2014-7960](/security/CVE-2014-7960))

Clay Gerrard discovered Swift allowed users to delete the latest version

of object regardless of object permissions when allow\_version is

configured. An attacker could use this issue to delete objects.

([CVE-2015-1856](/security/CVE-2015-1856))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.04

* [swift](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/swift)
  -
  [2.2.2-0ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/swift/2.2.2-0ubuntu1.3)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [swift](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/swift)
  -
  [1.13.1-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/swift/1.13.1-0ubuntu1.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

  -
  [1.4.8-0ubuntu2.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/swift/1.4.8-0ubuntu2.5)

After a standard system update you need to restart swift to make

all the necessary changes.

Message-ID: <20141007215242.GJ9817@openstack.org>
Date: Tue, 7 Oct 2014 21:52:42 +0000
From: Jeremy Stanley <jeremy@...nstack.org>

Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Swift

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public,
although an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Swift metadata constraints are not correctly enforced
Reporter: Rajaneesh Singh
Products: Swift
Versions: up to 2.1.0

Description:
Rajaneesh Singh reported a vulnerability in Swift enforcement of
metadata contraints. By adding metadata in several separate calls,
an authenticated attacker can bypass the max_meta_count constraint,
potentially resulting in the storage of more metadata than allowed
in configuration.

### Bug Description

For an example,

Metadata constraints defined in documents like the no. of maximum metadata that can be supported on an account/container/object can be 90. But it is more specific to an individual request.

If we pass more than 90 metadata in one request, it fails. But if we pass 50 in one request and 50 in another request, the request is successfully processed which is against documentation.

Same applies to metadata size and other constraints too.

Documetation Reference:

<http://docs.openstack.org/grizzly/openstack-object-storage/admin/content/swift-constraints.html>

In which version(s) of swift was this behavior observed?

I can confirm this for account and container level, but not for object level.

Whenever you do a POST with some metadata to an object, the existing metadata is replaced, thus if you POST two sets with 50 metadata entries you end up with an object with 50 metadatas (last update wins).

@Jeremy: my tests were against latest master. That said, after having a look at the source I think this affects all Swift versions (for the account and container level).

Thanks all! I've confirmed the security advisory task for this, on the assumption that any proposed solution could likely be backportable to currently supported stable releases. If this turns out not to be feasible after all, then we can revisit the decision.

Hi Christian,

The above case occurs in account and container only.

While in object case, the metadata is overwritten with new request's metadata. The old metadata is lost if we don't pass it in the new request.

There could be two possible ways to resolve this problem:

1. We can inherit the same behavior of metadata in case of account/container as of object i.e the metadata will be overwritten in every new request.

2. We can HEAD the account/container, then after confirming the constraints defined we can perform the required action:

    \* If the combined metadata(new+old) complies to the constraint values, we will process the request.

    \*If it doesn't comply to the constraints values, we will throw error.

Could you please suggest which solution would be better?

Thanks Rajaneesh for working on this!

To answer your questions: I would recommend not to chose option #1 because it changes the behaviour fundamentaly, and this will affect users that rely on this feature.

Option #2 sounds good to me. There is still a small possibility to store more metadata entries due to the eventual consistency, but I think this is the best we can get away with.

Thanks Christian for your prompt reply.

It means total size of metadata for account/container should be in range of 4096 Bytes with update (not overwrite case).

please confirm it.

One more query Christian:

In HEAD command we get the actual size of metadata and new request's metadata also have fixed size. Then, How could be the possibility to store more metadata entries due to the eventual consistency..??

I'm not yet clear on why this is a security issue. I agree that it's something that should probably be fixed.

Perhaps an attacker could fill up a drive, a few K at a time. But that wouldn't result in a DOS of the cluster.

@Rajaneesh: 4096 is the default size, but it might be different - depending on the setting in swift.conf.

If you execute the HEAD to get the current size of the metadata entry the request might use an older version of the account/container database with a lower number of metadata entries, but the actual metadata entry might be higher.

@John: agreed, it's not a serious security issue. But then I think it might be a good idea to fix this before making the bug public? Otherwise people might try to abuse the current behavior?

I talked with Same yesterday about this. Since the metadata blob is serialized in memory, this could cause memory exhaustion on that particular server. At best, this is a very low impact security issue.

The fix would be to do something like this:

1) accept the meta from the user and merge it with the existing metadata. If it's larger than something like eg 5x the total allowed size, reject the response with a 4xx series code.

2) with the new combined list of metadata entries, filter out all the old deleted ones, and if the resulting set is greater than the allowed max, reject the response with a 4xx series code.

This will keep the metadata bounded, but still allow for users to delete existing rows and keep updating metadata.

@John: i'm still unconvinced this is a security issue. If I understand correctly, max\_meta\_overall\_size limits the whole (key,value) space anyway so you can't just add that many of them ? Do you still think there is potential for DoS ?

Thierry: max\_meta\_overall\_size limits the total metadata size for a given request, but it does not limit the total metadata size, so that can grow without bound. Since Swift loads that in memory all at once, there is potential for a DoS here.

(Note that I haven't tried it out yet, but based on some quick code reading, I believe the bug report to be correct.)

Ah, OK, I misread the doc ("max\_meta\_overall\_size [is] the max number of bytes in the utf8 encoding of the metadata (keys + values"). I guess that can be abused, then (free storage!)

@Rajaneesh: could you attach the patch to this bug first ? We can review it locally on the private bug so that we limit the public vulnerability window.

Since the bug is now public, there's no need to attach patches to it and they can just be reviewed through the normal code review process instead.

In the future, please refrain from submitting changes for public review which mention private bugs (or any other disclosure of private bugs for that matter). Thanks, and apologies for any confusion.

Hi Christian Schwede, John Dickinson, Richard Hawkins,

I was wondering whether it is possible to submit a patch if someone else is assigned to.

I have been working on this for last one week and due to some reasons I was not able to submit new patch set.

But how is it possible that without any prior notification a new patch for this bug has already been merged into master branch?

@Rajaneesh Singh: Typically, people don't submit competing patches. That is, if person A is working on fixing a particular bug, person B will not also work on fixing that bug.

However, as you've seen here, there are exceptions. In this case, you turned this bug from a private security vulnerability, for which the fix could take a while without a problem, and turned into a public security vulnerability by publishing a patch to Gerrit, thus requiring the fix to be merged expeditiously. Now, the patch you submitted broke existing unit tests, functional tests, and even the pep8 checks. However, since you took no action on fixing the test failures for two weeks, and a release deadline was coming up, and the CVE was public, someone else had to step in and fix the bug properly. Here, Richard Hawkins stepped in and submitted an alternate patch for this security hole, and had he not done so, I would have.

Note that this was only necessary due to the broken embargo on this security vulnerability. As I said earlier, normally people stay out of each others' way.

Rajaneesh,

In general, we don't try to work on tasks that others have already claimed (eg a bug assigned). However, it happened in this case for a couple of different reasons.

First, last week we were wrapping up the dev work for Swift that would be included in the OpenStack Juno integrated release. Since the Juno release is time-based, we needed to get everything done last week. Since the patch had already been reported publicly and we hadn't head from you in many days, we wanted to ensure that it got included.

Secondly, last week many Swift devs (including Rick who wrote the merged patch), were together at a Swift hackathon. While there we wrapped up many patches that needed to be included in the release, including one to fix this bug you found.

Us developing this patch and merging it last week in no way is a reflection on you or your code. We simply needed to have a patch (with tests) merged last week, and we took advantage of sitting in the same room together.

Thank you for identifying the bug and starting on the patch. If you'd like to continue to stay involved in Swift's dev work (and I hope you do!), then join us in #openstack-swift on freenode IRC. You can also take a look at <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift/PriorityReviews> for what we're currently prioritizing in reviews and <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Swift/ideas> for a list of some smaller, more isolated ideas of new stuff to work on.

Anyway, for swift community it is fine and i am also part of this community.

But for the individual or new person (this was my first patch) it is not quite good. It really demotivates a person who was working on this from last couple of weeks. Due to some issue I could not submit new patch set.

I could commit if i know about deadline. I should have prior notification for this patch submission.

Thanks John Dickinson, Samuel Merritt for your clear and satisfactory reply.

Ensure sys.exit called in fork\_child after exception

Currently, the fork\_child() function in auditor.py does not

    handle the case where run\_audit() encounters an exception

    properly.

A simple case is where the /srv directory is set

    with permissions such that the 'swift' user cannot access it.

    Such a situation causes a os.listdir() to return an OSError

    exception. When this happens the fork\_child() process does not

    run to completion and sys.exit() is not executed. The process

    that was forked off continues to run as a result. Execution goes

    back up to the audit\_loop function which restarts the whole process. The

    end result is an increasing number of processes on the system

    until the parent is terminated. This can quickly exhaust the

    process descriptors on a system.

This change wraps run\_audit() in a try block and adds an

    exception handler that prints what exception was encountered.

    The sys.exit() was moved to a finally: block so that it will

    always be run, avoiding the creation of zombies.

with permissions such that the 'swift' user cannot access it.
Such a situation causes a os.listdir() to return an OSError
exception. When this happens the fork\_child() process does not
run to completion and sys.exit() is not executed. The process
that was forked off continues to run as a result. Execution goes
back up to the audit\_loop function which restarts the whole process. The
end result is an increasing number of processes on the system
until the parent is terminated. This can quickly exhaust the
process descriptors on a system.
This change wraps run\_audit() in a try block and adds an
exception handler that prints what exception was encountered.
The sys.exit() was moved to a finally: block so that it will
always be run, avoiding the creation of zombies.

Fix ring-builder crash.
If you adjust the replica count after adding devices but before the
first rebalance, the ring builder would crash.
To reproduce:
$ swift-ring-builder crashy.builder create 8 3 1
$ swift-ring-builder crashy.builder add r1z1-10.1.1.1:6000/sda1 1
$ swift-ring-builder crashy.builder set\_replicas 5
$ swift-ring-builder crashy.builder rebalance

Limit partition movement when adding a new tier
When adding a new tier (region, zone, node, device) to an existing,
already balanced ring all existing partitions in the existing tiers of
the same level are gathered for reassigning, even when there is
not enough space in the new tier. This will create a lot of unnecessary
replication traffic in the backend network.
For example, when only one region exists in the ring and a new region is
added, all existing parts are selected to reassign, even when the new
region has a total weight of 0. Same for zones, nodes and devices.
This patch limits the number of partitions that are choosen to reassign
by checking for devices on other tiers that are asking for more
partitions.
Failed devices are not considered when applying the limit.

Fix up the return value of launch()
This is "obviously" the right thing to do, except of course it's
pure sugar: the return value is not used anywhere. Except if someone
has a script that imports the whole thing somehow and then does
isinstance(dict). Because that is so much easier than submitting
a patch, I can imagine someone, somewhere doing that.
The fix came in a patch by dfg, see review 121851.

Fixes unit tests to clean up temporary directories
This patch fixes the unit tests to remove the temporary directories
created during run of unit tests. Some of unit tests did not tear down
correctly, whatever it had set it up for running. This would over period
of time bloat up the tmp directory. As on date, there were around 49 tmp
directories left uncleared per round of unit tests. This patch fixes it.

This patch provides the necessary error handling while unpickling

the stacktrace was shown to user with an exit code of 1. This fixes it
to show a user-friendly message and also returns the exit code of 2,
indicating there was a failure.

updated hacking rules
1) Added comment for H231, which we were already enforcing. H231
is for Python 3.x compatible except statements.
2) Added check for H201, which we were enforcing in reviews
but waiting on hacking checks to be updated. H201 is for bare
except statements, and the update in upstream hacking is to
support the " # noqa" flag on it.
The H201 check catches some existing bare excepts that are fixed.

disk\_chunk\_size is unused by the ObjectReplicator class. Note that it

direct\_client not passing args between some functions
The call to \_get\_direct\_account\_container in direct\_get\_account
has several of its args =None instead of set to the value passed
to direct\_get\_account.
The same applies to \_get\_direct\_account\_container in
direct\_get\_container.
The direct\_get\_container is only called by the account-reaper
and this bug will have limited impact on it. The marker,
maintained in reap\_container, is ignored by direct\_get\_container.
This is not as bad as it sounds, if the account-reaper successfully
deletes the first 10K objects, assuming the container has > 10K
objects, the next call to direct\_get\_container will in fact return
the next 10K objects even though it sets marker=None (assuming the
first 10K objects were successfully deleted).
This patch also updates test\_direct\_get\_account and
test\_direct\_get\_container to ensure the appropriate
args are included in the connection query\_string.

Let eventlet.wsgi.server log tracebacks when eventlet\_debug is enabled
The "logging" available in eventlet.wsgi.server/BaseHTTPServer doesn't
generally suite our needs, so it should be bypassed using a NullLogger in
production. But in development it can be useful if tracebacks generated from
inside eventlet.wsgi (say a NameError in DiskFile.\_\_iter\_\_) end up in logs.
Since we already have eventlet\_debug parsed inside of run\_server we can skip
the NullLogger bypass and let stuff blast out to STDERR when configured for
development/debug logging.

Expected results: ----------------- Packages in ISO should be present in errata.  Additional info: ---------------- The tool can be found here -   <https://github.com/sgraf-pub/iso-validator>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1246216#c1)  Shruti Sampat    2015-07-23 17:52:14 UTC  ``` Please see the list of packages in ISO missing in repos to be as follows -  ## Packages on ISO, missing in yum repos set(['clusterlib-3.0.12.1-73.el6.i686',      'corosynclib-1.4.7-2.el6.i686',      'libqb-0.17.1-1.el6.i686',      'openaislib-1.1.1-7.el6.i686',      'pacemaker-cluster-libs-1.1.12-8.el6.i686',      'pacemaker-libs-1.1.12-8.el6.i686'])  Please ignore the list of packages given in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1246216#c0) as that is not the correct list.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1246216#c4)  Sreenath G    2015-07-24 09:16:25 UTC  ``` All the i686 packages mentioned in this bug are pulled-in to ISO/repo by their x86_64 counterparts. And those are present in the "x86_64" of the latest RHEL-6 ISO. See [1]     So as this is a small list, the only workaround to avoid this is to filter those packages (force mode) from the next ISO spin. But there is a chance of failure, when we try to focefully exclude rpms. So I will give a try and update the status here.

## Topic

Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1, which fixes multiple security issues, several bugs,
and adds various enhancements, is now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that
provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data
storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves availability and
manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.

Red Hat Gluster Storage's Unified File and Object Storage is built on
OpenStack's Object Storage (swift).

A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in OpenStack Object Storage
(swift). By adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user
could bypass the max\_meta\_count constraint, and store more metadata than
allowed by the configuration. (CVE-2014-7960)

Multiple flaws were found in check-mk, a plug-in for the Nagios monitoring
system, which is used to provide monitoring and alerts for the Red Hat
Gluster Storage network and infrastructure: a reflected cross-site
scripting flaw due improper output encoding, a flaw that could allow
attackers to write .mk files in arbitrary file system locations, and a flaw
that could possibly allow remote attackers to execute code in the wato (web
based admin) module due to the unsafe use of the pickle() function.
(CVE-2014-5338, CVE-2014-5339, CVE-2014-5340)

This update also fixes numerous bugs and adds various enhancements. Space
precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are
directed to the Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 Technical Notes, linked to in
the References section, for information on the most significant of these
changes.

This advisory introduces the following new features:

* NFS-Ganesha is now supported in highly available active-active

environment. In a highly available active-active environment, if a
NFS-Ganesha server that is connected to a NFS client running a particular
application crashes, the application/NFS client is seamlessly connected to
another NFS-Ganesha server without any administrative intervention.

* Snapshot scheduler creates snapshots automatically based on the

configured scheduled interval of time. The snapshots can be created every
hour, a particular day of the month, particular month, or a particular day
of the week.

* You can now create a clone of a snapshot. This is a writable clone and

behaves like a regular volume. A new volume can be created from a
particular snapshot clone. Snapshot Clone is a technology preview feature.

* Red Hat Gluster Storage supports network encryption using TLS/SSL.

Red Hat Gluster Storage uses TLS/SSL for authentication and authorization,
in place of the home grown authentication framework used for normal connections.

* BitRot detection is a technique used in Red Hat Gluster Storage to

identify the silent corruption of data with no indication from the disk to
the storage software layer when the error has occurred. BitRot also helps
in catching backend tinkering of bricks, where the data is directly
manipulated on the bricks without going through FUSE, NFS or any other
access protocols.

* Glusterfind is a utility that provides the list of files that are

modified between the previous backup session and the current period.
This list of files can then be used by any industry standard backup
application for backup.

* The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) is part of the NFS v4.1 protocol

that allows compute clients to access storage devices directly and in
parallel. pNFS is a technology preview feature.

* Tiering improves the performance, and the compliance aspects in a Red Hat

Gluster Storage environment. It serves as an enabling technology for other
enhancements by combining cost-effective or archivally oriented storage for
the majority of user data with high-performance storage to absorb the
majority of I/O workload. Tiering is a technology preview feature.

All users of Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to apply this update.
