Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7960:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided text directly references CVE-2014-7960, and multiple sources discuss a vulnerability related to metadata constraints in OpenStack Swift. The description of the vulnerability across sources is consistent, referencing the ability to bypass `max_meta_count` by adding metadata in multiple requests. Therefore, the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenStack Swift enforces metadata constraints, specifically the `max_meta_count` constraint. Instead of checking the *total* metadata count across multiple requests, Swift only checks the amount of metadata added in each individual request.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Inadequate Metadata Constraint Enforcement:** Swift fails to correctly enforce the intended limits on total metadata size/count by not aggregating across multiple requests.
    *   **Bypassable Limits:** The vulnerability can be exploited by making several separate API calls, each adding a small amount of metadata that individually is within allowed limits. Cumulatively, these requests bypass the configured maximum limits.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Increased Storage Usage:** An attacker can store more metadata than allowed, which could lead to potentially excessive storage space usage. Although, it is often mentioned that the *size* of metadata is also checked with `max_meta_overall_size`, and this is a per request limit, that is not the main focus. This implies that just adding metadata will not result in an infinite consumption of space, but it's still a potential problem if exploited.
   *    **Resource Exhaustion (Possible):** One source mentioned that the metadata is serialized in memory, and this could cause a memory exhaustion on that particular server which may cause a Denial of Service. This is not the main impact, but a possible implication.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **API Calls:** Attackers leverage the Swift API (POST requests) to add metadata incrementally through multiple requests.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** Exploiting the vulnerability requires an authenticated attacker (a valid Swift user account)
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Swift API endpoints.

**3. Additional Notes**

*   **Patching:** The vulnerability was addressed by implementing checks that aggregate the metadata counts across multiple requests. Patches were provided for various OpenStack Swift releases, and also backported to stable branches. Red Hat and Ubuntu provided security updates to address this issue in their distributions.
*  **Severity:**  This vulnerability is generally rated as having *Moderate* severity. The main impact appears to be the ability to circumvent intended metadata restrictions which may lead to a small increase in storage, and possible resource exhaustion on affected servers.

**4. Summary of findings across various sources**

*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat Security Advisories RHSA-2015:0835 and RHSA-2015:0836 explicitly state that CVE-2014-7960 is related to bypassing metadata constraints by adding it across multiple calls in OpenStack Swift. Also, in Bugzilla, Red Hat has a bug related to this issue - Bug 1150461.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu Security Notice USN-2704-1 confirms the fix for CVE-2014-7960 is related to improperly enforced metadata limits, allowing an attacker to store more than allowed.
*   **Openwall:** The openwall.com mailing list archives confirm the initial CVE request for the issue.
*  **SUSE**:  SUSE's CVE pages confirm CVE-2014-7960 relates to a metadata limit bypass in OpenStack Swift and link to the bugzilla and advisory where a fix has been released.
*   **Launchpad:**  Launchpad bug #1365350 is the original bug report for this vulnerability, where the initial discovery and discussion of this flaw began. This bug also links to the code review changes that implemented the fix.
*   **OpenStack:** Code changes to address the vulnerability can be found at review.openstack.org (e.g.  <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/125360/>)

In summary, the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-7960 is caused by insufficient metadata constraint checking in OpenStack Swift, which can be exploited by authenticated users by issuing multiple API requests to add more metadata than intended, potentially leading to excessive resource usage and limited DoS.
