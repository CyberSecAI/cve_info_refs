  "CVE-2014-7283": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's XFS file system implementation ordered directory hashes under certain conditions. A local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the file system by creating directories with colliding hash values, potentially resulting in a system crash.",
    "root_cause": "The btree hash index array pointer in `xfs_da3_fixhashpath()` was incorrectly converted, causing the current hash to be compared against the first entry in the btree instead of the correct entry.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect pointer conversion",
      "Improper ordering of directory hashes",
	  "Incorrect comparison of hashes"
    ],
    "impact": "On-disk directory corruption, leading to potential system crashes or filesystem shutdowns. Access to directory entries may be compromised. Attempts to remove entries from a corrupted directory could lead to a filesystem shutdown. Further access to a corrupted directory may cause kernel oops or panic, even after running xfs_repair.",
    "attack_vector": "Local attacker creating directories with specific hash collisions.",
    "required_capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to create directories."
