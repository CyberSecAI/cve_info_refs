The provided content is related to CVE-2014-7609.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they don't verify if the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against a trusted root certificate authority.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
- Ability for an attacker on the same network to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Exploiting the lack of proper SSL certificate validation to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- Ability to intercept network traffic (MITM)

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects numerous Android applications.
- The CERT/CC blog provides details on the dynamic testing methodology used to identify vulnerable applications (CERT Tapioca).
- The vulnerability is tracked in a Google Spreadsheet, which contains a list of affected applications and availability of fixes.
- There were FTC settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma for failing to secure sensitive information transmissions.
- The affected vendors were notified of this vulnerability.
