{
  "CVE-2014-7970": {
    "Description": "The pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not properly interact with certain locations of a chroot directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop) via . (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root system call.",
    "Root cause": "The `pivot_root` implementation doesn't properly handle specific locations within a chroot environment, specifically when the new root path is below the current root in the mount tree, leading to a loop in the mount tree after detaching and reattaching.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of paths in pivot_root",
      "Insufficient validation of new root mount",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can cause a denial of service resulting in a mount-tree loop which can make the system unstable, and also potentially cause a leak of the mounts.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Manipulating chroot environments and pivot_root system calls"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "Local user privileges within the target system."

  "CVE-2014-7842": {
    "Description": "Race condition in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 3.17.4 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application that performs an MMIO transaction or a PIO transaction to trigger a guest userspace emulation error report, a similar issue to CVE-2010-5313.",
    "Root cause": "Race condition within the KVM subsystem when handling MMIO or PIO transactions leading to a guest userspace emulation error report.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Improper handling of emulation errors in KVM",
     "Insufficient synchronization in KVM when handling MMIO/PIO transactions"

    "Impact": "A guest OS user can cause a denial of service (guest OS crash).",

        "Guest OS user executing a crafted application",

    "CVE-2014-8133": {
        "Description": "arch/x86/kernel/tls.c in the Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 allows local users to bypass the espfix protection mechanism, and consequently makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism, via a crafted application that makes a set_thread_area system call and later reads a 16-bit value.",
        "Root cause": "The Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation in the Linux kernel allows bypassing of the espfix protection due to improper handling of set\_thread\_area calls and subsequent 16-bit value reads.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Improper handling of set_thread_area system calls",
            "Weaknesses in espfix protection mechanism",

  "CVE-2014-8160": {
        "Description": "net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_generic.c in the Linux kernel before 3.18 generates incorrect conntrack entries during handling of certain iptables rule sets for the SCTP, DCCP, GRE, and UDP-Lite protocols, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via packets with disallowed port numbers.",
        "Root cause": "Incorrect conntrack entries are generated due to improper handling of iptables rules for specific network protocols (SCTP, DCCP, GRE, UDP-Lite).",
