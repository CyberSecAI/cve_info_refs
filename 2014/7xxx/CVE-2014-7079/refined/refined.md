The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7079.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify if the SSL certificate provided by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to check if the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing and arbitrary code execution.
- Sensitive personal information can be compromised.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker can intercept and modify network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the targeted Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic (e.g., via a rogue Wi-Fi access point).
