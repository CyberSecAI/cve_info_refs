The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7106.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This occurs when the application does not verify that the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Applications are not verifying the SSL chain, leading to a vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can intercept and potentially modify network traffic that was intended to be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to:
  *   Credential stealing
  *   Arbitrary code execution
  *   Viewing/modification of sensitive data transmitted via the affected application

**Attack vectors:**
  *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
  *   Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
  *   Exploitation occurs over the network when the vulnerable app makes a https connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  *   The attacker must be positioned on the same network as the victim.
  *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects multiple Android applications.
* The CERT Coordination Center performed dynamic testing to identify affected applications using a tool called "CERT Tapioca".
* A spreadsheet is maintained with details of affected applications and available fixes.
* The vulnerability has been publicly known since 2012 but was officially published in 2014.
* The content suggests users avoid using affected applications and untrusted networks.
* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against vendors for failing to properly implement SSL encryption in their apps.
* The vulnerability is associated with CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and CWE-296 (Improper Handling of Certificate Validation Results).
