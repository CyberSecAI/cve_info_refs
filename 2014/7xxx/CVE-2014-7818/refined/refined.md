The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Action Pack handles specially crafted requests when static file serving is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allows for arbitrary file existence disclosure. It's an information leak vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can use specially crafted requests to determine if a file exists on the filesystem outside of the Rails application's root directory. The content of the files is not exposed, but their existence can be verified.

**Attack vectors:**
Specially crafted HTTP requests sent to the affected Rails application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server. The application must have static file serving enabled (`config.serve_static_assets = true`).
