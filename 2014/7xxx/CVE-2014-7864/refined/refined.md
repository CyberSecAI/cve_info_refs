Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-7864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a blind SQL injection flaw found within the `FailOverHelperServlet` of ManageEngine OpManager and IT360. The servlet's `standbyUpdateInCentral` operation is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `customerName` and `serverRole` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly return the results of the SQL query, making it a "blind" injection. Attackers can still infer information by observing the application's behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary SQL Execution: A successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing and stealing sensitive data from the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or corrupting data stored in the database.
    - Privilege escalation: Gaining unauthorized access to the database server and possibly the underlying system.
    - Denial of service: Making the application/database unavailable by causing errors/crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests: The vulnerability is exploited via specifically crafted POST requests sent to the `FailOverHelperServlet`.
-  Specifically, the vulnerable parameters are within the `standbyUpdateInCentral` operation.
- The vulnerable URLs are:
    ```
    /servlet/com.adventnet.me.opmanager.servlet.FailOverHelperServlet?operation=standbyUpdateInCentral&customerName=[SQLi_1]&serverRole=[SQLi_2]
    ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application:
    - OpManager: Unauthenticated access is needed to exploit this vulnerability
    - IT360: Requires an authenticated session for the same operation

**Affected Products & Versions:**
- ManageEngine OpManager v8 - v11.Y bXXXXX
- ManageEngine IT360 v? to v10.5
- Note that this vulnerability is related to file download and information disclosure vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-7863) that affect the same products.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text mentions that this vulnerability remains unpatched in IT360 as of the time of the advisory.
- Metasploit modules have been created to exploit the associated arbitrary file download and directory content disclosure vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-7863)
