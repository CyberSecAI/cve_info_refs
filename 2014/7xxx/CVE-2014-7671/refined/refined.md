The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7671.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. Instead of verifying the entire SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA), these apps are not performing this step correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the server certificate on SSL/TLS connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks become possible.
- Attackers on the same network can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by an attacker positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- Must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
