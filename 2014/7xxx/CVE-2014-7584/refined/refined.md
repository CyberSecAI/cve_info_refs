{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates in SSL/TLS connections."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable application and the server.",
       "Must be on the same network as the Android device"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from applications not validating the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA). A large number of applications were found to be vulnerable."
