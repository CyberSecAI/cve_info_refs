{
  "vulnerability_1": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of input fields used in the search function of the dmmjobcontrol Typo3 extension.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database or manipulate data, by injecting malicious SQL code into the search query. The blind aspect implies the attacker may not receive immediate feedback but can infer results based on time-based attacks (e.g., using `benchmark()` or similar functions)",
    "attack_vectors": "HTTP requests to the job search function of the Typo3 extension, specifically exploiting the 'education', 'region', 'sector' and other similar input fields.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Typo3 instance. No authentication is required."
  },
  "vulnerability_2": {
      "root_cause": "The 'keyword' parameter in the search functionality is used without sanitization, which allows injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, which can be used to steal session cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or deface the website.",
      "attack_vectors": "HTTP requests to the job search function of the Typo3 extension, specifically using a crafted value for the 'keyword' parameter.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Typo3 instance and have a victim visit this manipulated link. No authentication is required."
