The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7668.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Arbitrary code execution, depending on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- Attackers need to be on the same network as the Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided spreadsheet (Android apps that fail to validate SSL) lists affected applications, versions, and fix availability.
- CERT Tapioca was used to test the applications.
- The issue was reported by Will Dormann of CERT/CC and others.
- A total of 23667 apps out of 1000462 tested apps failed dynamic SSL validation testing.
