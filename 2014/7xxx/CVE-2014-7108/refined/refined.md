The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7108.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This occurs because applications do not properly verify the SSL/TLS server certificate against a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain of trust.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Exploitable on any network where the attacker can intercept traffic between the Android device and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- Ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic (MITM).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Android applications and libraries.
- The testing methodology used by CERT to identify vulnerable applications is described in the CERT/CC blog using "CERT Tapioca" tool.
- The affected applications are listed in a spreadsheet, which also includes updates on fixes.
- The vulnerability was reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC, along with others.
- The vulnerability is linked to CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and CWE-296 (Improper Handling of Certificate Validation).
- Affected applications include those that have been included in the spreadsheet, along with any applications that failed the described dynamic SSL validation.
