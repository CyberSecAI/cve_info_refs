The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7697.

**Root Cause:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they don't verify if the certificate presented by a server is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks become possible.
- Attackers can potentially view or modify network traffic meant to be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing, arbitrary code execution and data modification are potential outcomes depending on the application's function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device (e.g., same Wi-Fi network).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
