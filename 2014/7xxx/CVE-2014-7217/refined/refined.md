Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7217:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input, specifically within the handling of ENUM values in phpMyAdmin. Maliciously crafted ENUM values could introduce script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core vulnerability is XSS (CWE-79), where the application fails to properly sanitize output, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary script code that executes in the victim's browser.
- Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a specific context (CWE-661): This is a more specific CWE that relates to how the application incorrectly handles special characters when generating HTML, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code, which can then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the affected pages (table search and table structure).
- Potential impacts include:
    - Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    - Defacement of the page
    - Redirection to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Stealing sensitive information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious ENUM value within a database table.
- When a logged-in user interacts with the table search or table structure pages that display this ENUM value, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to modify database table structures and values within a MySQL database managed by phpMyAdmin.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to phpMyAdmin itself, but needs to be logged into the underlying database.
- The exploitation requires a logged-in phpMyAdmin user to view the affected table data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered "non-critical" because it requires the attacker to have database access and the impact is limited to users logged into phpMyAdmin, not affecting unauthenticated visitors.
- The issue was fixed by sanitizing the output of ENUM values using `htmlspecialchars()` in multiple files ( `libraries/Util.class.php` and `libraries/TableSearch.class.php`)

**Summary of Changes based on commit diffs:**
- In `libraries/TableSearch.class.php`:
    - `htmlspecialchars()` is applied to the column type when displayed in the table search form and data type attributes.
- In `libraries/Util.class.php`:
    - `htmlspecialchars()` is applied to the `printtype` variable before it's used in HTML, to ensure special characters in ENUM values are properly escaped.
