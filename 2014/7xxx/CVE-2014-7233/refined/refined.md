{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The affected GE Healthcare devices use default or hard-coded credentials.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper authentication due to the use of default or hard-coded credentials.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to the affected devices, potentially leading to unauthorized access to patient data, modification of device configurations, and potential harm to patients through radiation dosage manipulation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote network access, either through direct connection to the internet or by gaining access to the hospital's network. The devices themselves may also be exposed via the web due to poor network configurations.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A low-skilled attacker can exploit the vulnerability if they can gain network access to the devices. This can be achieved by being on the same network as the devices, or gaining access to the hospital's internal network."
