Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-7819

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an information leak in the `rubygem-sprockets` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Existence Disclosure:**  Specially crafted requests can be used to determine if a file exists on the filesystem outside of the application's root directory. Although the files are not served to the attacker, the attacker can ascertain whether specific files are present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain knowledge of the existence of files on the server that they should not have access to, potentially revealing sensitive information about the system's configuration or installed applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers exploit the vulnerability by crafting specific HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected application or server.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects all versions of `rubygem-sprockets` prior to the patched versions.
- Patched versions are 3.0.0.beta.3, 2.12.3, 2.11.3, 2.10.2, 2.9.4, 2.8.3, 2.7.1, 2.5.1, 2.4.6, 2.3.3, 2.2.3, 2.1.4, and 2.0.5
- A workaround is available for Rails applications by setting `config.serve_static_assets = false`. However, this may not be feasible in all environments, and upgrading is recommended.
- The issue was addressed in various openSUSE security updates (SU-2014:1502-1, SU-2014:1504-1, SU-2014:1513-1, and SU-2014:1514-1) and also fixed in SUSE Cloud products.
