The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7578.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible, allowing attackers to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Possible credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept and manipulate the communication between the app and the server.
- This is especially pertinent on untrusted networks, such as public Wi-Fi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be capable of performing a MITM attack.
