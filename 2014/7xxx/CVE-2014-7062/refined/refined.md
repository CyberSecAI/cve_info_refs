The provided content is related to CVE-2014-7062.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. They do not verify if the certificate provided by the site was issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Arbitrary code execution (depending on the application's functionality).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Interception of HTTPS communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must be on the same network (e.g., same Wi-Fi) as the target Android device.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM).
