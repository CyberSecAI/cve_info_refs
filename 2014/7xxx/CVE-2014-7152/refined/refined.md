Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7152:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The plugin "Easy Forms for Mailchimp" exposed an AJAX function to unauthenticated users using the `nopriv` method. This allowed anonymous users to update plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugin allowed unauthenticated access to an AJAX function that could modify settings.
- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Specifically, the plugin allowed users to update the Custom Opt-In Message with HTML content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Persistent XSS:**  Malicious HTML/JavaScript injected into the Custom Opt-In Message would be executed in the browsers of users who view the affected form or page. This could lead to:
    - **Website defacement:**  Altering the appearance of the website.
    - **Malicious script injection:**  Redirecting users to malicious sites or stealing user data.
    - **Session Hijacking:** potentially stealing user session cookies

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated exploitation:** An attacker could send a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the appropriate parameters to inject malicious HTML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No prior access required:** The attacker did not need any credentials or be logged in to the WordPress site.
- **Network access:** The attacker needed to be able to send an HTTP POST request to the WordPress site.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions 3.0 to 5.0.6 of the plugin.
- A fix was released in version 5.0.7, which resolved the issue.
- The exploit could allow a malicious actor to inject arbitrary HTML/Javascript
- The vulnerability was discovered, reported, acknowledged, patched, and a CVE was assigned all within a week.
