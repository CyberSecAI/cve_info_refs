**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain
- Failure to ensure the certificate comes from a trusted root CA

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack
- Viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS
- Credential stealing
- Arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker on the same network as the Android device
- Untrusted networks such as public WiFi

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic
- Be on the same network as the vulnerable device
