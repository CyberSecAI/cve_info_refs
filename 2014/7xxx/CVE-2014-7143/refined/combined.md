| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-09-18 08:26:11 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :   The twisted security project has identified, fixed, and released a release fixing a security issue, I would like a CVE assigned:  Title: trustRoot not respected in HTTP client Reporter: Alex Gaynor and David Reid (Rackspace) Products: Twisted (14.0 only). Description: When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client, Twisted did not respect the user's specification, and always used the default of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use this feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA.  Twisted 14.0.1 has been issued to resolve this issue; (Distributors should note that this release has failing tests, and that a 14.0.2 release will be issued tomorrow, this does not effect the fix, only the tests).    @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-12-01 16:30:16 UTC  ``` Only v14.x branch was affected because this was the branch when the feature was developed, see <https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/4888>.  Affected version hit Gentoo repository via <https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-python/twisted-core/twisted-core-14.0.0.ebuild?hideattic=1&view=log>  Fixed version appeared via <https://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/dev-python/twisted-core/twisted-core-14.0.1.ebuild?hideattic=1&view=log>  However v14.x branch was already cleaned up via <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/dev-python/twisted-core?id=30aa69ba0c44805daa77f664a35643eed86c697d> so nothing left to do for us.   @ Maintainer(s): Security recommends to stabilize v15+ in near future because validating certificates is a must these days and this feature isn't present in the current stable branch. However that's not part of this bug.   @ Security: Please vote! ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2016-12-02 08:40:29 UTC  ``` GLSA Vote: No ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1143802#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-18 03:49:12 UTC  ``` The following flaw was reported in the Twisted HTTP client:  "" When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client, Twisted did not respect the user's specification, and always used the default of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use this feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA. ""  It was reported that this issue only affects version 14.0. This version is not in Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and source code inspection reveals the patch does not apply.  Upstream fix:  <https://twistedmatrix.com/~diffresource.twistd/7647>  Original report:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/17/4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1143802#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-18 03:51:11 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of python-twisted-web as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.   ``` |  |
