  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-7146",
    "description": "There's a PHP code injection vulnerability within the Import/Export plugin (/plugins/XmlImportExport/ImportXml.php): user input passed through the \"description\" field (and the \"issuelink\" attribute) of the uploaded XML file isn't properly sanitized before being used in a call to the preg_replace() function which uses the 'e' modifier. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code when the Import/Export plugin is installed.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `ImportXml.php` file of the XML Import/Export plugin. User-provided data from the 'description' field and 'issuelink' attribute within an uploaded XML file is not sanitized properly before being used in a `preg_replace()` function call using the 'e' modifier. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code.",
    "weakness": "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input, leading to PHP code injection vulnerability via usage of the `e` modifier in `preg_replace`.",
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server where the vulnerable MantisBT instance is hosted, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted XML file to the MantisBT instance using the XmlImportExport plugin. The 'description' field and the 'issuelink' attribute within the XML are manipulated to contain malicious PHP code.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to upload XML files to the MantisBT instance where the XmlImportExport plugin is enabled. This likely requires a user account with sufficient permissions to access the import functionality of the plugin."
