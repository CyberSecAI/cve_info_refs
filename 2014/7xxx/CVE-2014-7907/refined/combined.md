Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/11/stable-channel-update_18.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, November 18, 2014

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 39 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 39.0.2171.65 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* 64-bit support for Mac
* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A partial list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/38.0.2125.0..39.0.2171.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [42 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M39&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.

We would also like to thank *Atte Kettunen, Christian Holler, cloudfuzzer,* and *mmaliszkiewicz* for working with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. $16500 in additional rewards were issued.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes:

[[433500](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=433500)] CVE-2014-7910: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1894)

## Topic

Updated chromium-browser packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 Supplementary.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Chromium is an open-source web browser, powered by WebKit (Blink).

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Chromium to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Chromium. (CVE-2014-7904, CVE-2014-7906, CVE-2014-7907, CVE-2014-7910,
CVE-2014-7908, CVE-2014-7909)

A flaw was found in the way Chromium parsed certain URL values. A malicious
attacker could use this flaw to perform phishing attacks. (CVE-2014-7899)

All Chromium users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
Chromium version 39.0.2171.65, which corrects these issues. After
installing the update, Chromium must be restarted for the changes to take
effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
