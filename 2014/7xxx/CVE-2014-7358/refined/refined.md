Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-7358 (although the provided document indicates "None" for CVE ID, the document is for VU#582497 which has been associated to CVE-2014-7358 based on external sources)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means the applications do not verify that the certificate provided by the server is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation: Applications do not verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain, leaving them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Lack of proper implementation of SSL encryption:  As mentioned in the FTC press release, many companies fail to implement SSL encryption properly in their mobile apps.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept and modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Data Exposure: Sensitive information being transmitted over the network (such as credentials) can be viewed by the attacker.
- Arbitrary code execution: In some cases, the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: Attackers positioned on the same network as the victim (e.g., on a public Wi-Fi network) can intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the targeted device.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM).
- No authentication is required for exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
- A spreadsheet ([Android application SSL spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing)) was created to track affected applications and their fixes.
- The vulnerability was discovered using the CERT Tapioca tool, and the methodology is described in a CERT/CC blog post.
- The issue is related to insecure coding practices, specifically CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and CWE-296 (Improper Handling of Certificate Verification).
- The vulnerability has been publicly known since 2012, but the CERT/CC report was published in September 2014.
