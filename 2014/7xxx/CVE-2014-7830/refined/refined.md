Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-7830:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The last search string in the Feedback module was not properly escaped in the search input field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of output escaping. Specifically, the `$searchcourse` variable in `mod/feedback/mapcourse.php` is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected search input field, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the search string within the Feedback module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to provide a crafted search string to the feedback module's search input field. This could be achieved via a crafted link or direct manipulation of the search functionality.
