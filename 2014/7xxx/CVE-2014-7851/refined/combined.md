| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c0)  Alon Bar-Lev    2014-11-07 17:53:20 UTC  ``` In 3.5.0 there are two sessions between browser and backend: 1. engine 2. restapi  When logout, only (1) is invalidated.  This is incorrect security behavior, all sessions should be invalidated when user logs out.  UI-Plugins included.  Urgent to be fixed for 3.5.1   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c1)  Alon Bar-Lev    2014-11-12 07:09:27 UTC  ``` actually since 3.2.2   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c2)  Sven Kieske    2014-11-18 12:34:52 UTC  ``` this should block 3.5.1 release, if it's urgent :)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c3)  Gonza    2014-12-11 13:46:10 UTC  ``` Which version is this fixed on?   This issue is still appearing on: rhevm-3.5.0-0.23.beta.el6ev.noarch  Steps used to reproduce: 1. Logged in through webadmin and through the API with a session cookie 2. Signed out on webadmin 3. Called the API with the same session cookie and it returned a succesful result   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c4)  Alon Bar-Lev    2014-12-11 16:03:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to grafuls from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c3)) > Which version is this fixed on?   please try use this repo[1]  [1] <http://bob.eng.lab.tlv.redhat.com/builds/latest_vt/>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c5)  grafuls    2014-12-11 18:54:05 UTC  ``` Same result, for that version which I hope it's the following:  # yumdb info rhevm Loaded plugins: product-id, versionlock rhevm-3.5.0-0.23.beta.el6ev.noarch      changed_by = 0      checksum_data = 5c7174bd1d292a6c388b8d88ab1bb15cbd28cddac74719db0d29422cf4c86248      checksum_type = sha256      from_repo = rhevm35      from_repo_revision = 1417692417      from_repo_timestamp = 1417692437      installed_by = 0      reason = user      releasever = 6Server   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c6)  Alon Bar-Lev    2014-12-11 19:16:54 UTC  ``` as far as I can see 45fc369a is applied in this package.  please explain what is: "Logged in through webadmin and through the API with a session cookie"   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c7)  grafuls    2014-12-12 08:54:14 UTC  ``` I logged in to the engine webadmin through: http://[engine-IP]/ovirt-engine/webadmin/  For the RestAPI I connected following this: <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.4/html-single/Technical_Guide/index.html#Authentication_Sessions>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c8)  Alon Bar-Lev    2014-12-12 11:39:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to grafuls from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c7)) > I logged in to the engine webadmin through: > http://[engine-IP]/ovirt-engine/webadmin/ >  > For the RestAPI I connected following this: > <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/> > Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.4/html-single/Technical_Guide/index. > html#Authentication_Sessions  you created a separate session that is detached from the webadmin session, so it has its own life cycle.  we discuss here the restapi restapi session that is created by webadmin and transfered to ui-plugins for example.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c9)  Gonza    2014-12-23 09:05:50 UTC  ``` Verified on: rhevm-3.5.0-0.23.beta.el6ev.noarch  Steps: 1. Logged in through webadmin and 2 session cookies were created, one for webadmin and one for API.  2. Tried to access the API with same cookie headers via curl and got a succesful response. 3. Logged out from webadmin and tried to access the API through curl with the previous cookie headers but got a 401 response requesting for http authentication.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730#c10)  Sandro Bonazzola    2015-01-21 16:03:43 UTC  ``` oVirt 3.5.1 has been released. If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1165311#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-11-18 19:36:38 UTC  ``` It was reported that oVirt 3.2.2 and later did not correctly terminate sessions when a user logged out from the web interface (there are two sessions used between the browser and the backend: the engine and the restapi).  Upon logout, only the engine session was invalidated but the restapi session persisted.  If an attacker could obtain that session data and login with their own credentials, they could replace their session token with the stolen token and elevate their privileges to that of victim user.  Note that in order for this to be exploited, the attacker must also have a valid login and authenticate successfully.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1165311#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-11-18 19:37:58 UTC  ``` The original oVirt bug report is here: [Bug #1161730](show_bug.cgi?id=1161730 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Logout must logout all sessions")   ``` |  |
