Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2014-7851:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the oVirt web administration interface (ovirt-engine-webadmin) did not invalidate all user sessions upon logout. Specifically, it only invalidated the main "engine" session but left the "restapi" session active.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incomplete session invalidation upon logout.
- Presence of multiple session types (engine and restapi), where one was not properly managed during logout.
- The restapi session remains active, even after a user has logged out via the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who could obtain the restapi session token of a logged-out user, and who has their own valid login, could use the stolen session token to impersonate the victim and gain their privileges.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can potentially perform actions on the system using the victim's privileges until the restapi session expires or is manually terminated.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Obtaining the restapi session token through unspecified means (e.g., session hijacking, access to the user's browser session data).
- The attacker must have valid login credentials to the oVirt system.
- The attacker needs to replace their valid session token with the stolen session token.
- After logout on webadmin, the user might think he is disconnected, but the attacker can still use the API with the stolen session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- A valid user account on the oVirt system.
- The ability to obtain a valid, active restapi session token from a logged-out user.
- Ability to manipulate the session tokens and use it to send requests.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in oVirt versions 3.2.2 and later.
- The issue affects the web administration interface and can be exploited through the API.
- The vulnerability was fixed in oVirt version 3.5.1, as indicated by the resolution of the associated bug reports.
