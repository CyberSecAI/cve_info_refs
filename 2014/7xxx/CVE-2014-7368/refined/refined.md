  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates",
       "Failure to validate the SSL chain against trusted root certificate authorities"
    ],

       "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the Android device",
        "Exploiting the lack of proper SSL certificate validation during HTTPS connections."

        "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.",
