Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in the context of CVE-2014-7718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the SSL certificate chain. This allows for the possibility of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can intercept and potentially modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
*   **Data Exposure/Modification:** Depending on the application, the impact can include viewing or modifying sensitive data, potentially leading to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Credential Stealing:** Attackers could steal user credentials if they are transmitted without proper SSL validation.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, manipulated network traffic could lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack vector is primarily network-based. The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This can include public Wi-Fi networks.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the device and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*  **MITM Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the network traffic (e.g., by using a rogue access point or ARP spoofing).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC, with additional reporters of the concept of Android apps that fail to validate SSL certificates including Tony Trummer, Tushar Dalvi, and Kuo Chiang.
*   The vulnerability is tracked in a Google spreadsheet ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing)) that lists the affected applications.
*   CERT developed a tool called Tapioca to detect the SSL issues.
