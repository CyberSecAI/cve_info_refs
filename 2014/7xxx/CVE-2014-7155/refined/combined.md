Multiple security issues have been discovered in the Xen virtualisation
solution which may result in denial of service, information disclosure
or privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-3+deb7u3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-7155 / XSA-105
                              version 3

    Missing privilege level checks in x86 HLT, LGDT, LIDT, and LMSW emulation

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

This issue has been assigned CVE-2014-7155.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The emulation of the instructions HLT, LGDT, LIDT, and LMSW fails to
perform supervisor mode permission checks.

However these instructions are not usually handled by the emulator.
Exceptions to this are
- - when the instruction's memory operand (if any) lives in (emulated or
  passed through) memory mapped IO space,
- - in the case of guests running in 32-bit PAE mode, when such an
  instruction is (in execution flow) within four instructions of one
  doing a page table update,
- - when an Invalid Opcode exception gets raised by a guest instruction,
  and the guest then (likely maliciously) alters the instruction to
  become one of the affected ones.

Malicious guest user mode code may be able to leverage this to install
e.g. its own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).

IMPACT
======

Malicious HVM guest user mode code may be able to crash the guest or
escalate its own privilege to guest kernel mode.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen versions from at least 3.2.x onwards are vulnerable.  Older
versions have not been inspected.

Only user processes in HVM guests can take advantage of this
vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.

There is no mitigation available for HVM guests.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered Andrei Lutas at BitDefender and analyzed by
Andrew Cooper at Citrix.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
