Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Xen hypervisor's emulation of the x86 instructions: HLT, LGDT, LIDT, and LMSW. Specifically, the emulator fails to perform proper supervisor mode permission checks when handling these instructions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Privilege Level Checks:** The core issue is the lack of privilege level checks during the emulation of the mentioned x86 instructions. This means that user-mode code within a guest operating system can potentially execute these instructions, which are typically reserved for the kernel or hypervisor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Guest Crash:** Malicious user-mode code within a guest VM can crash the guest OS.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious guest can potentially escalate its privileges from user mode to kernel mode. This could allow the guest to gain full control over the guest OS and potentially impact other guests or the hypervisor itself.
*   The advisory from xenbits.xen.org specifically notes that a guest could install its own Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HVM Guests:** Only HVM (Hardware Virtual Machine) guests are vulnerable. PV (Paravirtualized) guests are not affected.
*   **User-Mode Code:** The exploit is triggered by malicious user-mode code within the guest VM.
*   **Specific Instruction Emulation Cases:** The vulnerability is triggered when the emulator is invoked under specific conditions:
    *   When the instruction's memory operand is located in emulated or passed-through memory-mapped I/O space.
    *   In 32-bit PAE mode, when the instruction is within four instructions of a page table update.
    *   When a guest raises an invalid opcode exception and then alters the instruction to become one of the affected ones.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control of user-mode code within an HVM guest operating system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the execution flow of the guest to trigger the vulnerable code paths of the emulator.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Xen versions from at least 3.2.x onwards.
*   The issue was discovered by Andrei Lutas at BitDefender and analyzed by Andrew Cooper at Citrix.
*   Patches are available to resolve the issue.

In summary, CVE-2014-7155 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Xen's HVM emulation, where missing privilege checks allow a malicious user-mode guest process to gain control over critical system functions.
