The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7022.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This can include public Wi-Fi or other untrusted networks.
