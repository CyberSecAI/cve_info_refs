The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7364.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means that the application does not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This can lead to the viewing or modification of network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential stealing and arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- The attacker intercepts the network traffic between the application and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be capable of intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic (MITM).
