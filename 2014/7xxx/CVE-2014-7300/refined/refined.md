    "CVE-2014-7300": {
        "description": "The PrtSc key is not disabled when the screen is locked. Taking a bunch of screenshots at once bloats gnome-shell to the point where it's pretty easy to get it targeted by the kernel's oom-killer. This means that anyone with access to the keyboard of a locked GNOME session can (briefly) disable the lockscreen, which lets them see and interact with the running gnome session.",
        "root_cause": "The Print Screen (PrtSc) key functionality was not disabled when the GNOME desktop screen was locked.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Lack of proper input sanitization",
            "Resource exhaustion via uncontrolled actions"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker with physical access to a locked GNOME session can bypass the lock screen by repeatedly pressing the Print Screen key, causing gnome-shell to crash and exposing the user's session.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Physical access to the system keyboard"
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "Physical access to the system keyboard."
