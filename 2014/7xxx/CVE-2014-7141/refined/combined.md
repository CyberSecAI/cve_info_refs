# CVE-Request: squid pinger remote DoS

---

*From*: Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer () suse de>

*Date*: Tue, 9 Sep 2014 10:53:51 +0200

---

```
Hi

I made a fix for squid 3.4.6 and request a CVE for
this issue:

The pinger code that checks for nodes being alive doesnt
properly validate ICMP and ICMPv6 replies, in particular
icmp6 types which are used to index into a string array.
This could cause crashes when the index is OOB.

A patch is available here:

<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=891268>

I also made some cleanups and error checking on the
receive socket.

I am not deep into the overall squid architecture so
I dont know what happens to squid itself when the
pinger sub-process crashes (think SIGPIPE etc). But to me
it looks like you can only DoS the pinger sub-system,
not the whole squid.

Sebastian

```

As far as we can tell, CVE IDs are required for cases #1 and #3:

```
> ```
> 1. "used to index into a string array" possibly corresponds to
> <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/129.html> for the modified

> patch
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-7141.

```
> ```
> 3. added "if (preply.psize) < 0" code apparently corresponds to a more
> general issue with missing data validation
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-7142.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2014:4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2014:4
Date: September 15, 2014
Summary: Multiple issues in pinger ICMP processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.x -> 3.4.7
Fixed in version: Squid 3.4.8

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7142
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrect bounds checking Squid pinger binary is
vulnerable to denial of service or information leak attack when
processing larger than normal ICMP or ICMPv6 packets.
Due to incorrect input validation Squid pinger binary is
vulnerable to denial of service or information leak attacks when
processing ICMP or ICMPv6 packets.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
Several bugs allow any remote server to perform a denial of
service attack on the Squid service by crashing the pinger.
Some of these bugs allow attackers to leak arbitrary amounts of
information from the heap into Squid log files. This is of higher
importance than usual because the pinger process operates with
root priviliges.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 3.4.8
In addition, patches addressing this problem for stable releases
can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 3.1:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/SQUID-2014\_4.patch
Squid 3.2:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/squid-3.2-11830.patch
Squid 3.3:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.3/changesets/squid-3.3-12683.patch
Squid 3.4:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.4/changesets/squid-3.4-13173.patch
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid built with --disable-icmp are not vulnerable to these
problems.
Check the server running processes list to determine if the Squid
service is running a "pinger" child process.
All unpatched Squid-2.x and Squid-3.x versions up to and
including 3.4.7 running the pinger process are vulnerable to
these problems.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workaround:
Configuring the firewall controlling access to Squid service such
that only ICMP ECHO packets are allowed delivery to the Squid
pinger process will limit the denial of service vulnerability.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your primary
support point. For subscription details see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
http://bugs.squid-cache.org/.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed list
(though anyone can post) and security related bug reports are
treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

Well, in any case whether its restarted or not, it should be fixed.
For me its a remote DoS, its your decision if it qualifies for a CVE.
The indexing bug is the "real issue" whereas the others IMHO qualify
as hardening and only produce junk-packets or fake logs if exploited.

# USN-2422-1: Squid vulnerabilities

25 November 2014

Squid could be made to crash if it received specially crafted network
traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [squid3](/security/cves?package=squid3) - Web proxy cache server

## Details

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the Squid pinger incorrectly handled

certain malformed ICMP packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to cause Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
