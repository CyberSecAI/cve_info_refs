  "CVE-2014-7141": {
    "Description": "The pinger in Squid 3.x before 3.4.8 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) via a crafted type in an (1) ICMP or (2) ICMP6 packet.",

      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Missing data validation"

     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
