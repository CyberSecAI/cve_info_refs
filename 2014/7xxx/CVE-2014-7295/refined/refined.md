Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-7295:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's incorrect handling of CSS and JavaScript module allowances. Specifically, user-created CSS was allowed to load on pages where user-created JavaScript was disallowed. This separation was flawed because both CSS and JavaScript can be used for malicious purposes, such as interface manipulation and code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is XSS achieved through CSS. While JavaScript was blocked on sensitive pages, the ability to load user-controlled CSS allowed for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript, especially in older browsers like Internet Explorer using CSS expressions. 
*  **UI Redressing/Interface Manipulation**: User-controlled CSS could manipulate the appearance of the interface, potentially tricking users into performing actions they didn't intend to, such as modifying settings or logging in to a malicious site. This could lead to actions being performed on the user's behalf without their explicit consent or knowledge.
*   **Inconsistent Security Policy:** The separation of CSS and JavaScript module allowance created an inconsistency in the security policy. It was assumed that blocking JavaScript was sufficient for security, but this overlooked the potential risks posed by CSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Takeover:** By manipulating the interface on sensitive pages like Special:Preferences and Special:UserLogin, an attacker could trick users into performing actions that could lead to account compromise.
*   **Data Theft:** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, successful exploitation could potentially be used to steal sensitive information presented on the manipulated interface.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could force users to perform unintended actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious CSS Injection:** An attacker would inject malicious CSS code into a user-controlled CSS file. 
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would likely have to trick a user into visiting a page where the injected CSS would be loaded, such as Special:Preferences or Special:UserLogin, to make the exploit effective.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MediaWiki User Account:** An attacker would need a MediaWiki user account with the ability to create or modify user CSS.
*   **Social Engineering or User Interaction:** The attacker would have to lure the victim to a page where the malicious CSS is active, typically a sensitive page, or find another method to have the user's browser load the malicious css.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability existed because the `disallowUserJs()` function only controlled `TYPE_SCRIPTS`, not `TYPE_STYLES` or `TYPE_COMBINED`.
* The fix involved removing the separation of CSS and JavaScript module allowance. This meant that if user-created JavaScript is disallowed, then user-created CSS would also be disallowed on the same page.
*  The fix also involved removing the ability to directly set module allowances.
* The issue was addressed in MediaWiki versions 1.19.20, 1.22.12, and 1.23.5, as well as in Debian by package version 1:1.19.20+dfsg-0+deb7u1.
* There was some initial pushback regarding this fix as it caused issues for wikis that use custom CSS for skinning, especially because site-wide CSS was also blocked, leading to the configuration option $wgAllowSiteCSSOnRestrictedPages being created to address the usability issue.
