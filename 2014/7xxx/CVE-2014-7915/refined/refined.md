  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow during table allocation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Integer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unspecified, but likely leads to memory corruption or other unexpected behavior due to incorrect memory allocation.",
  "Attack vectors": "Likely through crafted input that causes the table allocation logic to overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to provide input that triggers the vulnerable allocation path."
