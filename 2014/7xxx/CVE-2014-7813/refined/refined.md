Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of the `.to_sym` method on user-supplied input in the Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine (CFME).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Symbol DoS:** The core issue is that the Ruby `.to_sym` method, when used on untrusted input, can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS). An attacker can inject arbitrary strings that are converted into symbols. These symbols are not garbage collected, and repeated requests with new symbols can consume excessive memory, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. The server's memory usage increases with each request containing a new symbol until the system becomes unresponsive or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied data that reaches the vulnerable locations in the code where `.to_sym` is called. This input can be part of HTTP requests, data passed through APIs, or other forms of data entry points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the service to send crafted requests with new, unique strings that will be converted to symbols.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the parameters used in the application that eventually are passed to the vulnerable `.to_sym` call.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report explicitly mentions Aaron Patterson of the Red CloudForms Team as the discoverer of this issue.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having low severity.
*   The affected version is within Red Hat CloudForms 3, and an update is planned to address the issue, but a fix was not immediately applied.
*   The bug is closed with a "WONTFIX" status, suggesting that an update would be released, but not a patch.

The provided information gives more detail than a basic CVE description would likely contain, especially regarding the nature of the DoS through symbol generation and the specific context of Red Hat CloudForms.
