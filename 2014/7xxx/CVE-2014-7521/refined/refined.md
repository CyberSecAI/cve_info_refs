{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates in SSL/TLS connections (CWE-295)",
       "Incorrect implementation of SSL/TLS (CWE-296)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that is intended to be protected by HTTPS. Depending on the application, this could lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim and be able to intercept network traffic (e.g., on a public WiFi)."
