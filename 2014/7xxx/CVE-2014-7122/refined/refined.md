The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7122.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible, allowing an attacker to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential theft and arbitrary code execution.
- The specific impact varies depending on the application's function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- The vulnerability can be exploited via a MITM attack, intercepting communication between the application and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attacker must be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through dynamic testing using CERT Tapioca.
- A spreadsheet (linked in the document) provides details of affected applications.
- The document also mentions a related FTC settlement with Fandango and Credit Karma, which failed to properly implement SSL encryption.
- The CVSS score is provided as a reference and is 7.8 (Base Score) with the vector: AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N.
- The vulnerability has been publicly known since 2012, but was first published in this note on 2014-09-03.
