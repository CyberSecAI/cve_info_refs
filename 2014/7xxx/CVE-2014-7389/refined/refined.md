The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7389.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure that the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL/TLS server certificate

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This can lead to viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Possible outcomes include credential stealing and arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. An attacker intercepts communication between the app and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- No other special capabilities are specified.
