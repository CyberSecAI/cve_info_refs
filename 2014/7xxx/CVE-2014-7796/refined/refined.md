The provided content relates to **CVE-2014-7796**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify that the certificate provided by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper SSL certificate validation.
*   Failure to verify the SSL chain of trust.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   Viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
*   Credential stealing.
*   Arbitrary code execution (depending on the application's functionality).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Attacker on the same network as the Android device.
*   MITM attacks via malicious networks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
*   No specific authentication needed, as the vulnerability lies in the app's handling of SSL.
*   Attacker needs to be on the same network or in a position to intercept traffic.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is widespread, affecting a large number of Android applications.
*   The CERT/CC tested over 1 million apps, with over 23,000 failing the SSL validation.
*   The provided spreadsheet lists affected applications and available fixes.
*   The spreadsheet will be kept up to date with newly-discovered vulnerable applications, fixed versions, manual testing notes, and other information.
*   The vulnerability has been known since 2012-10-16 (Date Public) according to the document, but only became a concern after the disclosure that many apps were vulnerable.
*   The document also contains references to further information and blog posts detailing the vulnerability and the testing methodology.
