Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7906:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Use-after-free in pepper plugins.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to a crash or potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Chromium.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing malformed web content that uses pepper plugins. An attacker could create a malicious web page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page or otherwise load a specially crafted pepper plugin. This implies that the attacker needs to be able to serve or inject the malicious content.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Chrome version 39.0.2171.65.
- The fix was implemented by accessing `PepperMediaDeviceManager` through a `WeakPtr`, which is scoped to the `RenderFrame`. This change addresses the lifetime issue of the `PepperMediaDeviceManager` object that caused the use-after-free.
- Red Hat also addressed this vulnerability in their `chromium-browser` package through RHSA-2014:1894.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Chen Zhang (demi6od) of the NSFOCUS Security Team.
