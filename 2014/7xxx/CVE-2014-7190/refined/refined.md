Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-7190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of session tokens in Openfiler's system shutdown/reboot functionality. This allows an attacker to bypass CSRF protections by crafting a malicious form without the need for a valid session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The primary vulnerability is a CSRF flaw due to the missing session tokens which allows unauthenticated requests.
- Missing session tokens: The core weakness is the absence of proper session validation when performing a system shutdown or reboot, making it possible to trigger these functions via a forged request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition by forcing the Openfiler server to restart or shut down.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  A malicious HTML form can be created and sent to a user with an active session to the vulnerable Openfiler instance, forcing an unwanted shutdown or reboot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker must trick a user with an active session on the targeted Openfiler system into accessing the malicious HTML, which will trigger the POST request.
- No authentication is required because the vulnerability is due to the lack of session validation.
