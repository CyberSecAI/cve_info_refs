Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-7292:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `ct.ashx` handler of Newtelligence dasBlog. This handler is responsible for tracking clicked links within blog posts via a "Click-Through" feature. The handler takes a URL-encoded URL as input through the `url` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `ct.ashx` handler does not properly validate or sanitize the URL provided via the `url` parameter, allowing for an Open Redirect vulnerability. This occurs because the handler redirects the user to the provided URL without checking its validity.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when processed by the `ct.ashx` handler, redirects a user to an attacker-controlled website. This could be used for phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other malicious purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the vulnerable `ct.ashx` handler and a malicious URL in the `url` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to create a URL that includes the vulnerable `ct.ashx` handler and a malicious redirect URL.
