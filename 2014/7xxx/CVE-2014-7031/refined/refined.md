The provided content is related to CVE-2014-7031.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means they don't verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.
- Use of untrusted or public networks, increasing the risk of MITM attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This can lead to viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential theft and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Exploitation of the lack of SSL certificate validation by intercepting and manipulating network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM capabilities).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects numerous Android applications.
- The CERT/CC has identified affected applications through dynamic testing methodology using CERT Tapioca.
- A spreadsheet is available with a list of affected applications and their fix status.
- The vulnerability is tracked under VU#582497.
- Several entities have been notified including Amazon, Fortinet, Google, PNC Bank and Windstream.
