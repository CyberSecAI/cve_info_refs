The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7337.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This occurs because the applications do not verify if the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain and trust the certificate provided by the site was provided by a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Arbitrary code execution (depending on the application's function).

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
