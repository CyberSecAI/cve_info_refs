  "CVE-2014-7840": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Cve ID": "CVE-2014-7840",
      "Cve Description": "It was found that certain values that were read when loading RAM during migration were not validated. A user able to alter the savevm data (either on the disk or over the wire during migration) could use either of these flaws to corrupt QEMU process memory on the (destination) host, which could potentially result in arbitrary code execution on the host with the privileges of the QEMU process."
    },
    "Data": [
      {
        "Root cause": "Insufficient parameter validation during RAM loading in QEMU migration.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "The values read from the migration stream during RAM load were not validated.",
          "Specifically, the offset in `host_from_stream_offset()` and the length of writes in its callers were not validated."
        ],
        "Impact": "A user with the ability to alter the savevm data during migration (either on disk or over the wire) could corrupt the QEMU process memory on the destination host, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the QEMU process.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Manipulating the migration stream data on disk.",
          "Manipulating the migration stream data over the network."
        ],
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
          "Ability to alter the savevm data during migration.",
           "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the data stream between source and destination."
        ],
        "Notes": "This vulnerability is present in the qemu-kvm packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. It was discovered by Michael S. Tsirkin of Red Hat and fixed by upstream commit 0be839a2701369f669532ea5884c15bead1c6e08. The issue is rated as having Important security impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7."
