Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-7852:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because RichFaces, a framework for adding AJAX capabilities to JavaServer Faces (JSF) applications, does not properly sanitize strings included in a URL. It returns these strings unencoded in a CSS file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data (specifically URL strings) within the RichFaces framework.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to inject malicious scripts into the CSS file served by a vulnerable application. This can lead to a number of attacks:
  - **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal user cookies or session data.
  - **Session Hijacking:** Compromised user sessions can be hijacked, granting the attacker access to the user's account.
  - **Malicious Actions:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary actions within the context of a user's session, such as modifying data or performing unauthorized transactions.
  - **Defacement:** Attackers could inject malicious code to deface the application or website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attack can be carried out remotely by crafting malicious URLs.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs the user to visit a crafted URL that includes the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests containing malicious URLs to a vulnerable application server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have credentials or be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.1, which includes the vulnerable RichFaces component.
- Red Hat has provided a security update (RHSA-2014:1973) to address this issue.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" by Red Hat.
- The fix involves sanitizing URLs before including them in a CSS file to prevent the XSS attack.
