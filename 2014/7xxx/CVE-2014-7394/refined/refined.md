  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2014-7394",
      "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper verification of server certificates in SSL/TLS connections.",
        "Failure to validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by an attacker on the same network as the Android device.",
         "Exploitation of vulnerable applications via insecure networks."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device. Requires the ability to intercept and modify network traffic.",
     "additional_notes": "This vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications due to improper implementation of SSL/TLS certificate validation."
