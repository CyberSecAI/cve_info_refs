- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `pairing_cb.is_temp` flag, which indicates whether a pairing is temporary or permanent, was a "positive" flag. This means that if the flag was not explicitly set (e.g., due to a memory reset), it would default to assuming a permanent pairing. Under certain circumstances, this could lead to a link key being stored for a temporarily secured connection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect default handling of the temporary pairing flag. A "positive" flag default led to the potential storage of link keys for temporary pairings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A link key could be erroneously stored for a temporary connection, potentially leading to unintended persistent access.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability occurs when the temporary pairing flag is not explicitly set, causing the system to default to permanent pairing and store the link key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be involved in a Bluetooth pairing process and create a situation where the temporary pairing flag is not correctly set.
