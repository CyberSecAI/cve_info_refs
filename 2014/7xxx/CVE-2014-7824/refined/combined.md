Subject: CVE-2014-7824: D-Bus denial of service via incomplete fix for CVE-2014-3636

CVE: CVE-2014-7824
Tracked as: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85105>
Impact: local denial of service
Access required: local
Versions believed to be vulnerable: dbus >= 1.3.0
Fixed in: dbus 1.6.x >= 1.6.26, 1.8.x >= 1.8.10, all versions >= 1.9.2
Credit: discovered by Simon McVittie at Collabora Ltd.

D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an
asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used
for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other
operating systems.

The patch issued by the D-Bus maintainers for CVE-2014-3636 was based on
incorrect reasoning, and does not fully prevent the attack described as
"CVE-2014-3636 part A", which is repeated below. Preventing that attack
requires raising the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n) to a
higher value. CVE-2014-7824 has been allocated for this vulnerability.

To avoid propagating that higher limit to activatable system services,
it is desirable to start the system dbus-daemon as root so it can store
its previous limit, raise its limit, drop root privileges (which its
default configuration will do automatically), and restore the previous
limit before launching activatable services. Some operating system
distributions, such as anything using the upstream-supplied systemd
units, start the system dbus-daemon as root already; others, such as
Debian 7, currently start the system dbus-daemon under its less
privileged uid and will need minor modifications to their init scripts.

This is fixed in dbus 1.6.26, 1.8.10 and 1.9.2, released today. The
patch used in 1.8.x and 1.9.x is attached; it applies to 1.6.x with
trivial adjustments. Older versions are no longer security-supported by
the D-Bus maintainers, but any distributions needing those versions are
invited to share backported security fixes in the appropriate upstream
branches (dbus-1.4, etc.).

Attack details (repeating CVE-2014-3636 part A):

By queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender
could reach the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically
1024 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:

* new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon
* when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that
  contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,
  indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs
  do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds
  to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service
  to that sender

# [Advisories](index.html) » MGAA-2014-0182

## Updated dbus packages fix a regression with default auth\_timeout

Publication date: 28 Oct 2014

Modification date: 28 Oct 2014

Type: bugfix

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

## Description

```
As part of the earlier security update for dbus (MGASA-2014-0395)
default auth_timeout was changed from 30s to 5s to make it harder
to abuse on systems with no auth_timeout defined.

As it turns out it 5s is not enough for some systems to boot up and
activate services properly, so they ended up with services failing
to start up, leading to slow or unusable systems.

This update changes the default auth_timeout to 20s wich
appears to be enough to fix the issue.

```

## Binary packages built by this source

[dbus](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dbus):
simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus

 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be

 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using

 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but

 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

 .

 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 .

 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.

 .

 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no

 longer contained in this package.

[dbus-1-dbg](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dbus-1-dbg):
simple interprocess messaging system (debug symbols)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in

 terms of complexity.

 .

 This package provides support for debugging programs that use the core

 D-Bus shared library.

 .

 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

[dbus-1-doc](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/dbus-1-doc):
simple interprocess messaging system (documentation)

D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.

 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be

 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using

 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but

 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.

 .

 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.

 .

 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

[libdbus-1-dev](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libdbus-1-dev):

Package        : dbus
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-7824

Simon McVittie discovered that the fix for CVE-2014-3636 was
incorrect, as it did not fully address the underlying
denial-of-service vector.  This update starts the D-Bus daemon as root
initially, so that it can properly raise its file descriptor count.

In addition, this update reverts the auth_timeout change in the
previous security update to its old value because the new value causes
boot failures on some systems.  See the README.Debian file for details
how to harden the D-Bus daemon against malicious local users.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problem have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u5.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problem have been fixed in version 1.8.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.

# [Advisories](index.html) » MGASA-2014-0457

## Updated dbus packages fix security vulnerabilitiy

Publication date: 15 Nov 2014

Modification date: 15 Nov 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-7824](CVE-2014-7824.html)

## Description

```
The patch issued by the D-Bus maintainers for CVE-2014-3636 was based on
incorrect reasoning, and does not fully prevent the attack described as
"CVE-2014-3636 part A", which is repeated below. Preventing that attack
requires raising the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n) to
a higher value.

By queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender
could reach the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically
1024 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:

* new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon
* when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that
  contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,
  indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs
  do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds
  to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service
  to that sender.

This update resolves the issue (CVE-2014-7824).

Also default auth_timeout that was changed from 30s to 5s in MGASA-2014-0395,
and raised to 20s in MGAA-2014-0182 is now changed back to 30s as there
still are reports about failing dbus connections.

```

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c0)  Simon McVittie    2014-10-16 19:05:15 UTC  ``` dbus-daemon should increase its fd limit, but not pass the increased limit on to its children. Otherwise, it's easier than intended to carry out a DoS attack like the one described in [Bug #82820](show_bug.cgi?id=82820 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2014-3636: using all available file descriptors in dbus-daemon: limit DEFAULT_MESSAGE_UNIX_FDS").  This completes a partial fix for CVE-2014-3636 ([Bug #82820](show_bug.cgi?id=82820 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2014-3636: using all available file descriptors in dbus-daemon: limit DEFAULT_MESSAGE_UNIX_FDS")): the justification given on [Bug #82820](show_bug.cgi?id=82820 "RESOLVED FIXED - CVE-2014-3636: using all available file descriptors in dbus-daemon: limit DEFAULT_MESSAGE_UNIX_FDS") assumed a higher fd limit than what is actually present by default.  To avoid making it easier for system-activated services to DoS the system, we should also ensure that they do not inherit dbus-daemon's higher fd-limit. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c1)  Simon McVittie    2014-10-16 19:07:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 107944](attachment.cgi?id=107944 "Set fd rlimit to 64k for the system dbus-daemon") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=107944&action=edit "Set fd rlimit to 64k for the system dbus-daemon") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=85105&attachment=107944) Set fd rlimit to 64k for the system dbus-daemon  Restore the original rlimit for activated services.  ---  Yeah I know this needs a longer commit message. Ideas?  I used a hard-coded 64k fds rather than trying to calculate what we need, as Lennart suggested. If several uids collaborate to use up our fd limit then we lose anyway, afaics. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c2)  Simon McVittie    2014-10-16 19:18:50 UTC  ``` I'm not sure to what extent it's worth handling this as a vulnerability, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c3)  Simon McVittie    2014-10-16 19:23:44 UTC  ``` Debian with sysvinit or Upstart (but not systemd) as pid 1 also needs this patch, to start dbus-daemon with enough privileges that it can get the higher rlimit.  --- a/debian/dbus.init +++ b/debian/dbus.init @@ -69,7 +69,7 @@ start_it_up()      log_daemon_msg "Starting $DESC" "$NAME"    start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --pidfile $PIDFILE \ -    --user $DAEMONUSER --exec $DAEMON -- --system $PARAMS +    --exec $DAEMON -- --system $PARAMS    log_end_msg $?  } ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c4)  Lennart Poettering    2014-10-21 11:46:25 UTC  ``` Patch looks good in principle, but I probably wouldn't make it fatal if bumping the limit doesn't work...  BTW, the code that in systemd tries to make the best of the situation when bumping is here:  <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/tree/src/shared/util.c#n5185> ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c5)  Simon McVittie    2014-10-21 12:12:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Lennart Poettering from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c4)) > Patch looks good in principle, but I probably wouldn't make it fatal if > bumping the limit doesn't work...  Where do you see it being fatal? My intention was that the library code raises a DBusError, and the dbus-daemon catches the DBusError, logs it to syslog and carries on as if nothing had happened.  The only place where it's fatal is if we fail to put the old limit back before activating a child service (without using systemd), in which case it's fatal to the child service. I think that's correct: we shouldn't start children with elevated fd-limits.  The one possible improvement I can see in that area is that raise_file_descriptor_limit() should probably clear context->initial_fd_limit if _dbus_rlimit_raise_fd_limit_if_privileged() fails, so that we can only call setrlimit() from child_setup() if a previous setrlimit() in _dbus_rlimit_raise_fd_limit_if_privileged() has already succeeded.  We should maybe also add a log-level WARNING, corresponding to syslog WARNING, above the current INFO (which is, confusingly, syslog NOTICE). ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c6)  Lennart Poettering    2014-10-21 18:20:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to Simon McVittie from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c5)) > (In reply to Lennart Poettering from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c4)) > > Patch looks good in principle, but I probably wouldn't make it fatal if > > bumping the limit doesn't work... >  > Where do you see it being fatal?

D-Bus <<http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/>> is an asynchronous inter-process communication system, commonly used for system services or within a desktop session on Linux and other operating systems.  The patch issued by the D-Bus maintainers for CVE-2014-3636 was based on incorrect reasoning, and does not fully prevent the attack described as "CVE-2014-3636 part A", which is repeated below. Preventing that attack requires raising the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n) to a higher value. CVE-2014-7824 has been allocated for this vulnerability.  To avoid propagating that higher limit to activatable system services, it is desirable to start the system dbus-daemon as root so it can store its previous limit, raise its limit, drop root privileges (which its default configuration will do automatically), and restore the previous limit before launching activatable services. Some operating system distributions, such as anything using the upstream-supplied systemd units, start the system dbus-daemon as root already; others, such as Debian 7, currently start the system dbus-daemon under its less privileged uid and will need minor modifications to their init scripts.  Attack details (repeating CVE-2014-3636 part A):  By queuing up the maximum allowed number of fds, a malicious sender could reach the system dbus-daemon's RLIMIT_NOFILE (ulimit -n, typically 1024 on Linux). This would act as a denial of service in two ways:  * new clients would be unable to connect to the dbus-daemon * when receiving a subsequent message from a non-malicious client that   contained a fd, dbus-daemon would receive the MSG_CTRUNC flag,   indicating that the list of fds was truncated; kernel fd-passing APIs   do not provide any way to recover from that, so dbus-daemon responds   to MSG_CTRUNC by disconnecting the sender, causing denial of service   to that sender ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=85105#c26)  Simon McVittie    2014-11-06 16:51:47 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 109054](attachment.cgi?id=109054 "CVE-2014-7824: set fd rlimit to 64k for the system  dbus-daemon") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=109054&action=edit "CVE-2014-7824: set fd rlimit to 64k for the system  dbus-daemon") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=85105&attachment=109054) CVE-2014-7824: set fd rlimit to 64k for the system  dbus-daemon  This ensures that our rlimit is actually high enough to avoid the denial of service described in CVE-2014-3636 part A.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
