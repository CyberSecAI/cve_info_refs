Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-7224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `addJavascriptInterface` API in Android's WebView component, which allows JavaScript code within a WebView to access methods of Java objects exposed through this API.
*   Specifically, the issue is that two additional JavaScript objects, named "accessibility" and "accessibilityTraversal", are exposed by default through the `AccessibilityInjector` class when an accessibility service (like TalkBack) is enabled on an Android device.
*   These objects are injected into every WebView component of every app running on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintended Exposure:** The "accessibility" and "accessibilityTraversal" objects are exposed without explicit developer action, meaning that even apps not designed to use these interfaces become vulnerable.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By exploiting the exposed Javascript interfaces, an attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of a vulnerable application using a crafted web page within the application's WebView.
*   **Bypass of Intended Security:** Apps that are normally secure become vulnerable when accessibility services are enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into a WebView, which could then be used to execute arbitrary code on the device, potentially compromising user data and device integrity.
*   **Widespread Impact:** This vulnerability affects a broad range of Android devices and applications as it is triggered by a system-level feature (accessibility services). Any application using WebView is susceptible, regardless of whether the developer intentionally used addJavascriptInterface.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Content:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page containing JavaScript code designed to interact with the exposed `accessibility` or `accessibilityTraversal` objects.
*   **WebView Injection:** This crafted web content is loaded within a vulnerable app's WebView.
*   **Accessibility Service Requirement:**  The attack requires an accessibility service to be enabled on the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control WebView Content:** The attacker needs to be able to cause a vulnerable app to load the malicious web content in its WebView. This could be achieved by compromising a website that the app loads, using an embedded web page, or through other means of injecting web content.
*   **Target User Configuration:** The user must have an accessibility service enabled on their device for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Android versions up to 4.3, but not including 4.4, where AccessibilityInjector occurs.
*   The issue was reported to CVE and Google in September 2014, leading to the CVE assignment.
*   The `removeJavascriptInterface("accessibility")` and `removeJavascriptInterface("accessibilityTraversal")` method calls were recommended as mitigations for app developers.
