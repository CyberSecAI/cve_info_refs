      "Improper SSL certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic meant to be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
