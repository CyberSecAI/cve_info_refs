The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7905.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a flaw allowing navigation to intents that do not have the BROWSABLE category.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in how the browser handles intents, specifically when navigating to intents that lack the BROWSABLE category. This suggests a weakness in the intent handling logic, potentially overlooking security constraints.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to navigate to intents that are not meant to be accessed directly through the browser. This could lead to unintended actions or data exposure, depending on the specific intent and how it's handled by the receiving application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL or webpage that triggers a navigation to an intent without the BROWSABLE category. This means an attacker could potentially redirect a user to a non-browsable intent via a malicious webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into loading the malicious URL or webpage. This could be achieved through various methods, such as phishing emails, compromised websites, or malicious ads.
