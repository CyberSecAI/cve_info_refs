Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2014/11/stable-channel-update_18.html "Stable Channel Update")

Tuesday, November 18, 2014

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 39 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 39.0.2171.65 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* 64-bit support for Mac
* A number of new apps/extension APIs
* Lots of under the hood changes for stability and performance

A partial list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/38.0.2125.0..39.0.2171.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [42 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M39&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles). Below, we highlight fixes that were either contributed by external researchers or particularly interesting. Please see the [Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more information.
