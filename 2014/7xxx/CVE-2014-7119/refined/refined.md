The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7119.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means that the applications do not properly verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure that the certificate presented by the server is trusted by a root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically failing to verify the server certificate on SSL/TLS connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker on the same network can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Possible outcomes include credential stealing and arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack, specifically by performing a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is widespread, affecting numerous Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is maintained to track affected applications, fixes, and other details, indicating the scale of the issue.
- The vulnerability can be exploited on untrusted networks, such as public WiFi.
- The vulnerability was discovered using CERT Tapioca, a tool for testing applications for SSL vulnerabilities.
- The issue has led to settlements with vendors for failing to securely transmit sensitive personal information.
