Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2014-7751.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they don't verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root CA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper SSL certificate validation.
*   Failure to verify the SSL/TLS chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
*   Attackers on the same network may be able to view or modify network traffic.
*   Potential for credential stealing.
*   Possibility of arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Attacker positions themselves on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
*   The attacker intercepts and potentially modifies the network traffic between the device and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
*   Attacker needs to be able to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Android applications.
*   A spreadsheet (available at a provided Google Docs link and as a static copy) contains a list of vulnerable applications.
*   CERT Tapioca tool was used to test and discover the vulnerabilities.
*   The issue is related to insecure coding practices regarding SSL/TLS certificate verification, specifically [DRD19-J. Properly verify server certificate on SSL/TLS](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=134807561).
*   The vulnerability was publicly known since 2012-10-16, however was first published on 2014-09-03.
