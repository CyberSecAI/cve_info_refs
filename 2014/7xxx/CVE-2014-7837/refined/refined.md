Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-7837:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unvalidated parameters in the `mod/wiki/admin.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation on URL parameters in `mod/wiki/admin.php`.
- Lack of proper access control checks when deleting wiki pages, allowing users to delete pages they should not have permission to delete.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized data loss: Users with delete permissions in one wiki activity within a course could delete pages from other wiki activities in the same course, resulting in potential data loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- By manipulating URL parameters, a malicious user with delete permissions in one wiki activity can target other wiki activities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with delete permissions within at least one wiki activity in the course.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify URL parameters when accessing the wiki.
