Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect handling of permissions in `libvirt` when processing the `qemuDomainFormatXML` command. Specifically, the `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_MIGRATABLE` flag, intended for use in migration, was incorrectly implemented to always imply `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE` flag within the qemu implementation of  `virDomainGetXMLDesc` API. The `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE` flag is intended for use by read-write clients and should not be accessible by read-only clients. This created a bypass, allowing a read-only client to trigger the secure flag and access information normally restricted to read-write clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the flawed permission handling within the `libvirt` API, allowing read-only clients to access sensitive data.
*   **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability enables a read-only client to trigger a mechanism normally reserved for read-write clients to access information it should not be authorized to obtain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** A successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows a read-only client to gain access to the value of an optional VNC password that are embedded in domain xml files. This password should only be accessible to read-write clients.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Although the immediate impact is information leakage, a compromised VNC password could potentially be used to gain further unauthorized access to the virtual machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to establish a read-only connection to the `libvirtd` service.
*   **API Exploitation:** The attack relies on exploiting the flaw within the `virDomainGetXMLDesc` API with `VIR_DOMAIN_XML_MIGRATABLE` flag enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the `libvirtd` daemon.
*   **Read-Only Client Status:** The attacker must connect to the libvirt service as a read-only client.

**Additional Details:**

*   The leaked VNC password is capped at 8 bytes, sent in plaintext over the network and isn't compliant with FIPS mode execution, making it inherently weak.
*   Using SPICE connections instead of VNC is recommended.
*   Fine-grained ACLs can be used to prevent information leakage by denying access to read-only clients who do not also have read_secure privileges.
*  The vulnerability was introduced in commit `28f8dfdcccd4c0f69063ef741545b37d8a7f7935` and fixed in commit `b1674ad5a97441b7e1bd5f5ebaff498ef2fbb11b`.
*   The issue was reported by Eric Blake.

**Affected Software:**

*   `libvirt` versions prior to `1.2.11` are affected, including releases `v1.0.0` to `v1.2.10`.
*  Specific Linux distributions like Ubuntu and openSUSE were affected, requiring security updates.
