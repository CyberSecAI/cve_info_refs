Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-7858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a "Check_login bypass" in the D-Link DNR-326 device. The specifics of how the bypass occurs are not detailed in this content, but it implies a flaw in the login validation mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Authentication Bypass: The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the login process without needing valid credentials, which can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full Control: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain full control over the affected device. This means they can execute arbitrary code, modify configurations, access stored data, and potentially use the device as a springboard for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The content indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker, meaning the attacker does not need to be physically present or have prior access to the network.
- Web Interface: While not explicitly stated for this specific CVE, the broader context suggests that the attack likely targets the device's web interface, which is common for NAS and NVR devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device, meaning they must be able to reach the device on the network it is connected to.
- No Authentication: The attacker does not need to have valid user credentials due to the authentication bypass vulnerability.
