{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure that the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device can potentially view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via a compromised network.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
