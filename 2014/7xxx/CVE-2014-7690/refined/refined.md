Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-7690 (although not explicitly stated, this is related to VU#582497)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means they don't verify if the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain.
- Failure to ensure that the certificate was provided by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept and potentially modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- **Credential Stealing:** Attackers can steal usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information transmitted by the application.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some scenarios, an attacker might be able to inject malicious code.
- The overall impact varies depending on the functionality of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.
- Untrusted networks such as public WiFi hotspots, are particularly vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic.
- No specific user interaction is needed besides using a vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
