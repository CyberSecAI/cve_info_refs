```
This is an advisory for TWiki administrators: Attaching a specially named file allows remote upload of an Apache
configuration file. This applies to native TWiki installations on Windows, the TWiki-VM (virtual machine) running in a
Windows server environment is not affected.

TWiki ( <http://twiki.org> ) is an Open Source Enterprise Wiki and Web Application Platform used by millions of people.

---++ Vulnerable Software Version

   * TWiki-6.0.0 (TWikiRelease06x00x00)
   * TWiki-5.1.x (TWikiRelease05x01x00 to TWikiRelease05x01x04)
   * TWiki-5.0.x (TWikiRelease05x00x00 to TWikiRelease05x00x02)

   * TWiki-4.0.x (TWikiRelease04x00x00 to TWikiRelease04x00x05)

---++ Attack Vectors

Use an HTTP POST request towards a TWiki on Windows server to upload a specially named file (typically port 80/TCP).
Prior authentication is typically required.

---++ Impact

A remote attacker can upload a '.htaccess' file that may make uploaded files executable on the server.

---++ Severity Level

The TWiki SecurityTeam triaged this issue as documented in TWikiSecurityAlertProcess and assigned the following
severity level:

   * Severity 1 issue: The web server can be compromised

---++ MITRE Name for this Vulnerability

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CVE-2014-7237 [3] to this vulnerability.

---++ Details

If you attach a file named '%00.htaccess.' (e.g. a '.htaccess' configuration file with a leading null character and a
trailing dot) to a TWiki server on Windows, the attached file will be saved with name '.htaccess'. Under the assumption
that the Apache is configured to allow directory lever configuration files, it is therefore possible to upload a
configuration file that controls the attachment directory. This can be exploited to remotely upload and execute files
on the TWiki server.

__Background:__

In order to provide its users with dynamic content functionality, TWiki allows any sort of file to be uploaded and
attached into articles and pages. This may seem like a dangerous thing to do, but TWiki protects itself in a pretty
good way - It makes sure the file does not contain any dangerous extension (such as .php or .cgi) by using the
following regex:

^(\.htaccess|.*\.(?i)(?:php[0-9s]?(\..*)?|[sp]htm[l]?(\..*)?|pl|py|cgi))$

And if it does, it adds a '.txt' extension at the end of it.

On top of that, TWiki also uses an .htaccess file with the 'Options None' directive, which prohibits any use of CGI
execution, and with the PHP engine flag set to 'Off', which as one can understand - disables PHP execution.

Apart from all these defenses, TWiki makes sure it uses only the base name of the uploaded file (The file name without
any directory path), it removes any trailing dots, and removes any dangerous characters (Such as the famous Null Byte).
These security measurements leave us with almost nothing to do. Even without the Perl based defenses, the .htaccess
file does a pretty good job in securing the upload directory against any kind of code execution. So, the only logical
thing to do is try to upload an .htaccess file directly into the upload folder in order to bypass the original
.htaccess file that's located at the root of the TWiki 'pub' directory.

In order to do that we first must upload a file that starts with a dot. In order to do that let's look at the steps
TWiki takes in order to secure the file name - first it takes the file name without any directory path, then it removes
any leading dots, then it removes any dangerous characters, and finally it checks the file name using the mentioned
regex.

So, uploading a file named '.htaccess' just won't work because of the trailing dots removal. But, what if we'll use a
file name like '%00.htaccess'? TWiki will first try to remove any leading dots, but because the name doesn't have any
(Because of the leading null byte) none will be removed. Then it will remove any dangerous characters - our null byte -
and that will leave us with a nice clean '.htaccess' name.

But, what about the regex? We can see the regex only checks for a file named specifically '.htaccess'. For example, a
file named '.htaccesstest' will be uploaded successfully.

But what can we do with that? Well, in Windows, file names ending with a dot will be changed - the dot will be removed.
That means uploading a file named '.htaccess.' will pass the regex check, and the dot will be removed when storing the
file, resulting in a file named '.htaccess'.

So, if we upload a file named '%00.htaccess.' and it contains the 'Options' directive as 'All' and the 'SetHandler'
directive to allow CGI-scripts to be executed under a different extension, we will be able to execute code on the
server.

---++ Hotfix for TWiki Production Release 6.0.0

Apply the patch listed in the TWiki bug item at TWikibug:Item7560 [8]. The patch is also listed here, but due to
whitespace changes in e-mail it is not recommended to use below patch.

NOTE: In case you use a Perl accelerator make sure to clear the script cache. For example, in case of SpeedyCGI remove
the speedy cache (tmp/speedy.*) before restarting Apache.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
