Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-7920:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly references CVE-2014-7920 as part of a privilege escalation exploit, it is discussed on the blog post 'Android privilege escalation to mediaserver from zero permissions (CVE-2014-7920 + CVE-2014-7921)' and the patches are referenced in the git diff. So it is definitely related to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability exists within the `AudioPolicyManagerBase::startOutput` function of the `mediaserver` process in Android.
   - A lack of proper bounds checking when using the `stream` argument as an index into an array named `mRefCount` within an `AudioOutputDescriptor` object leads to a limited write primitive.
   - A similar lack of sanitization of the `stream` parameter is also found in the `AudioPolicyManagerBase::isStreamActive`, leading to an arbitrary memory read primitive.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds write:** The `startOutput` function uses the unvalidated `stream` parameter as an index into the `mRefCount` array, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. Specifically, the function increments the value of the given memory location by one.
   - **Out-of-bounds read:** The `isStreamActive` function uses the unvalidated `stream` parameter as an index into the `mRefCount` array, allowing for reading a value from arbitrary memory. The function reveals whether a value at the memory location is non-zero or zero, creating a read primitive
   - **Lack of input validation:** The core issue lies in the insufficient input validation in both functions regarding the stream parameter, which is used as an array index.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** By combining the limited write and limited read primitives, an attacker can overwrite function pointers within the `mediaserver` process, thereby achieving arbitrary code execution. Since the `mediaserver` process runs with high privileges, this constitutes a privilege escalation.
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By creating a ROP chain on the heap, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands, which they can also control the arguments for (by leveraging the read & write primitives).
   - **Bypassing ASLR:** Since the read primitive can reveal locations of libraries, which are usually dynamically loaded, and which makes memory locations unpredictable, it allows attackers to reliably execute an exploit on various Android versions.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious application:** An attacker can create a malicious Android application to exploit this vulnerability.
   - **Exploiting vulnerabilities in other services:** This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with other security flaws in other components of the Android OS to create an attack chain.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **No Permissions Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered from a standard Android application without requiring any special permissions.
   - **Basic Android Application Development Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to create and run a malicious Android application that can interact with the audio policy service.
