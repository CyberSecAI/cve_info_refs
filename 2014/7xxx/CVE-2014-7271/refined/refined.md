Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the sddm display manager, under certain conditions, allowed a user to log in as the "sddm" user without requiring authentication. This was due to a flaw in how sddm handled PAM authentication when the user was "sddm."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypassing Authentication:** The core issue was that when sddm detected the user as "sddm", it would use the "sddm-greeter" PAM service which had a permissive configuration (`pam_permit`) allowing login without proper authentication. This was intended to allow the greeter (login screen) to load, but it could be exploited.
*   **Unintended Privilege:** While the sddm user was not supposed to have high privileges, the ability to log in without authentication as that user still presented a security vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could bypass the normal login procedures and gain access to a session as the sddm user. While not necessarily granting root privileges, this could be abused to:

*   **Gain access to system resources**: Depending on the configuration of sddm and the system, the sddm user might have access to certain system resources or functionalities that should not be available to unauthenticated users.
*   **Potential further exploitation**:  Compromising sddm could be a stepping stone to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involved:
*   **Direct login:** Directly attempting to log in as the "sddm" user on the login screen.
*   **Conditions for the vulnerability**: The vulnerability could be triggered when sddm was a regular user account (not a uid-below-1000), or there was a way to choose the sddm user from the user list.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to:
*   **Physical or remote access** to the login screen of the affected system.
*   **Knowledge** of the vulnerability and the existence of the "sddm" user.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by explicitly preventing login attempts with the user "sddm".
*   The fix included the changes in the `Auth.cpp`, `Auth.h`, `Display.cpp`, `Greeter.cpp`, `Backend.cpp`, `Backend.h`, `HelperApp.cpp`, and `PamBackend.cpp` files as detailed in the provided github diff.
*   The fix was included in sddm version 0.10.0
*   The issue was considered a security issue by the vendor, even though it was not directly resulting in privilege escalation.
