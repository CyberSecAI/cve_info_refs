Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2014-7207:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the IPv6 networking subsystem of the Linux kernel, specifically within the `ipv6_select_ident` function. A Debian-specific patch introduced in Linux kernel 3.2.x failed to properly validate arguments passed to this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper argument validation in the `ipv6_select_ident` function, particularly regarding the `rt` argument which could be NULL.
- The vulnerability exposes a flaw where calling `ipv6_select_ident` with a NULL `rt` argument results in a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a denial of service, specifically a system crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vectors involve leveraging access to either `tun` or `macvtap` devices.
- A local user with the ability to use `tun` or `macvtap` can trigger the vulnerability.
- Virtual machines connected to such devices could also be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- The attacker requires access to either `tun` or `macvtap` devices. This could be direct access or via a virtual machine connected to such a device.

**Additional Information from the content:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Debian's Linux 3.2 based backport series.
- A fix involves disabling UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) in `macvtap`, `tun`, and `virtio_net` drivers, which can cause migration issues when moving VMs between patched and unpatched hosts.
- The fix disables UFO by default which is a regression from previous kernels.

**In summary, CVE-2014-7207 describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel where a local user with access to `tun` or `macvtap` devices can cause a system crash due to a NULL pointer dereference in the IPv6 subsystem.**
