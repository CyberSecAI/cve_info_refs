## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles

noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip

(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

([CVE-2014-3647](/security/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged

guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](/security/CVE-2014-3646))

A flaw was discovered with invept instruction support when using nested EPT

in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine). An unprivileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the guest.

([CVE-2014-3645](/security/CVE-2014-3645))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-3673](/security/CVE-2014-3673))

A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(panic). ([CVE-2014-3687](/security/CVE-2014-3687))

It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory

pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-3688](/security/CVE-2014-3688))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual

Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel

processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of

service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging

/dev/kvm access. ([CVE-2014-3690](/security/CVE-2014-3690))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the

Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](/security/CVE-2014-4608))

It was discovered the Linux kernel's implementation of IPv6 did not

properly validate arguments in the ipv6\_select\_ident function. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by

leveraging tun or macvtap device access. ([CVE-2014-7207](/security/CVE-2014-7207))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel was not checking the

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN when remounting filesystems to read-only. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (loss of writability).

([CVE-2014-7975](/security/CVE-2014-7975))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-72-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)

  -
  [3.2.0-72.107](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.2.0-72.107)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Debian Bug     : 766195

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service:

CVE-2014-3610

    Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM
    handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged
    guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (kernel panic) on the host.

CVE-2014-3611

    Lars Bull of Google reported a race condition in in the PIT
    emulation code in KVM. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o
    ports could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash)
    on the host.

CVE-2014-3645 / CVE-2014-3646

    The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security discovered
    that the KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully
    for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) and
    invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On
    hosts with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit
    support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions
    to crash the guest.

CVE-2014-3647

    Nadav Amit reported that KVM mishandles noncanonical addresses when
    emulating instructions that change rip, potentially causing a failed
    VM-entry. A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use this
    flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

CVE-2014-3673

    Liu Wei of Red Hat discovered a flaw in net/core/skbuff.c leading to
    a kernel panic when receiving malformed ASCONF chunks. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2014-3687

    A flaw in the sctp stack was discovered leading to a kernel panic
    when receiving duplicate ASCONF chunks. A remote attacker could use
    this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2014-3688

    It was found that the sctp stack is prone to a remotely triggerable
    memory pressure issue caused by excessive queueing. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to cause denial-of-service conditions
    on the system.

CVE-2014-3690

    Andy Lutomirski discovered that incorrect register handling in KVM
    may lead to denial of service.

CVE-2014-7207

    Several Debian developers reported an issue in the IPv6 networking
    subsystem. A local user with access to tun or macvtap devices, or a
    virtual machine connected to such a device, can cause a denial of
    service (system crash).

This update includes a bug fix related to CVE-2014-7207 that disables
UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload) in the macvtap, tun, and virtio_net
drivers. This will cause migration of a running VM from a host running
an earlier kernel version to a host running this kernel version to fail,
if the VM has been assigned a virtio network device. In order to migrate
such a VM, it must be shut down first.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.63-2+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Subject: CVE-2014-7207 assignment: Debian-specific Linux 3.2 backport issue

Debian has assigned CVE-2014-7207 to the following issue:

    Several Debian developers reported an issue in the IPv6 networking
    subsystem. A local user with access to tun or macvtap devices, or
    a virtual machine connected to such a device, can cause a denial
    of service (system crash).

    This update includes a bug fix related to CVE-2014-7207 that
    disables UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload) in the macvtap, tun, and
    virtio_net drivers. This will cause migration of a running VM from
    a host running an earlier kernel version to a host running this
    kernel version to fail, if the VM has been assigned a virtio
    network device. In order to migrate such a VM, it must be shut
    down first.

The bug report with a few more details is here:

  <<https://bugs.debian.org/766195>>

We believe this is specific to Debian's Linux 3.2-based backport
series.

## Packages

* [linux-ti-omap4](/security/cves?package=linux-ti-omap4) - Linux kernel for OMAP4

## Details

Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles

noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip

(Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use

this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.

([CVE-2014-3647](/security/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the

KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged

guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system

crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](/security/CVE-2014-3646))

A flaw was discovered with invept instruction support when using nested EPT

in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine). An unprivileged guest user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the guest.

([CVE-2014-3645](/security/CVE-2014-3645))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt

timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux

kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](/security/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual

Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged

guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel

panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](/security/CVE-2014-3610))

A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-3673](/security/CVE-2014-3673))

A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(panic). ([CVE-2014-3687](/security/CVE-2014-3687))

It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control

Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory

pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service. ([CVE-2014-3688](/security/CVE-2014-3688))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel's KVM (Kernel Virtual

Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel

processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of

service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging

/dev/kvm access. ([CVE-2014-3690](/security/CVE-2014-3690))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the

Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](/security/CVE-2014-4608))

It was discovered the Linux kernel's implementation of IPv6 did not

properly validate arguments in the ipv6\_select\_ident function. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by

leveraging tun or macvtap device access. ([CVE-2014-7207](/security/CVE-2014-7207))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel was not checking the

CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN when remounting filesystems to read-only. A local user could

exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (loss of writability).

([CVE-2014-7975](/security/CVE-2014-7975))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.2.0-1456-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4)
  -
  [3.2.0-1456.76](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1456.76)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

Hi,

after the latest point release some debian.org hosts became unreliable.
That was tracked down to a panic in the networking code. Ben provided a
test patch:

From: Ben Hutchings <ben@decadent.org.uk>
Date: Tue, 21 Oct 2014 00:49:22 +0100
Subject: ipv6: ipv6_select_ident: handle null rt
Forwarded: not-needed

In Linux 3.2, ipv6_select_ident() can apparently still be called with
rt == NULL and must avoid dereferencing it in this case.

We should probably fix the callers, so WARN_ON_ONCE to get a clue
about how this happens.

I think this is the upstream change which would fix this.  Please test
this on top of the previous one, in case there are any more cases where
ipv6_select_ident() may be called with a rt == NULL.

However, it seems that with this change, when a VM offloads UDP/IPv6
fragmentation to us, we will always set the fragmentation ID to 0.  I'm
not sure whether that's a regression from 3.2.62, but I think it is.  We
should not be choosing fragment IDs for VMs, but currently they aren't
telling us what to use!  I've queried this upstream.

Ben.

i have build a new kernel with the above mentioned patches applied. This
package is now available on
<https://people.debian.org/~zobel/linux-image-3.2.0-4-amd64_3.2.63-2a~test_amd64.deb>

Both machines that i installed the kernel on run for quite some time
without any issue now. Before those patches they stayed up only for a
few minutes.

Cheers,
Martin

I've now written and tested patches for that remaining regression.

There's a signed .changes file there as well, for verification
(distribution=UNRELEASED in case you are wondering).

Additional testing would be appreciated.

1. It shouldn't crash, obviously.

2. You may see a one-time warning about using UFO when we don't claim to
support it, until you also upgrade the guest kernels.  I found that
libvirt+QEMU tells guests they can use UFO even if the host tap device
refuses to support it.

3. UDP packets from the guest that require fragmentation should each get
a different fragmentation ID, and if they are sent at a low rate, the
IDs should not be consecutive (that was the purpose of the change in
3.2.63).  You can check this by capturing and dumping IPv6 fragments on
a *remote* machine:

    tcpdump -i eth0 -v 'ip6[6]==44'

Example output:

The first number after 'frag' is the fragmentation ID; here there are
two sets of fragments from two original 10K packets.

This should work whether or not the guest kernel is upgraded.

But it breaks live migration, probably when the source host runs an
older kernel.

When libvirt tries to complete the migration, it aborts with:
error: Domain not found: no domain with matching name 'VMNAME'

On the destination host, in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/VMNAME.log:
kvm: Features 0x300fffe3 unsupported. Allowed features: 0x711fbbe3
qemu: warning: error while loading state for instance 0x0 of device
'0000:00:03.0/virtio-net'
load of migration failed

I tried again with the older 3.2.60-1+deb7u3 on the destination host,
this works fine.

Cheers
 Harry

Yes, I can see how this (disabling virtio features) would prevent live
migration from old to new host kernels.  You will probably need a
one-time reboot of the guest when migrating to the new host kernel.

We could either mention this in the DSA text, or keep UFO enabled even
though it doesn't work correctly (in practice, we sort of have to do
that as the tap device's feature flags aren't respected by guests -
which I think is a QEMU bug).

Please let us know whether live migration between two hosts running the
new kernel version does work (I think it will).

I confirm that.

Although I did not exactly test this because of some constraints. I
tested with virsh save/restore which uses the same codepaths as virsh
migrate I think. This "cold migration" spewed out the same error
messages as written earlier when migrating from old to new. And it went
fine from new to new.

BTW I use a patched qemu-kvm because of
<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=724758>. So maybe there
are only a few wheezy users doing live migrations.

Cheers
 Harry

Thanks.  We're going to document the live migration issue rather than
fixing it.

At work we are using libvirt guest suspend rather than shutdown across
host reboots. It appears this feature uses migration because now we
cannot start any of our VMs (error below). I am going to do a downgrade
and upgrade dance to work around this bug but I really think that this
issue should be have been fixed rather than documented :(

# CVE-2014-7207

| **Name** | CVE-2014-7207 |

| **Description** | A certain Debian patch to the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel 3.2.x through 3.2.63 does not properly validate arguments in ipv6\_select\_ident function calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) by leveraging (1) tun or (2) macvtap device access. |
