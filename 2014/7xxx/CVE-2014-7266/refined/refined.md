Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) issue stemming from an incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (JVN#10319260). This suggests the initial patch was insufficient to address the underlying problem fully.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is a DoS vulnerability within the Remote Service Manager. The specific nature of the flaw isn't detailed in the provided text, but it allows an attacker to disrupt the service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, making the Remote Service Manager unavailable.
*   This disruption impacts "Cybozu Remote Service", potentially affecting users' ability to access internal systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable with network access (AV:N)
*   Specifics of the attack vector aren't given, but the network access suggests that an attacker can send malicious requests or data over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
*   Authentication is not required (Au:N).
*   The attacker does not require local access or adjacent network access.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a medium access complexity (AC:M), indicating some specialized conditions might be required for successful exploitation.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Cybozu, Inc.
*   The vulnerability can be remediated by applying the appropriate updates and changing the settings of `server.xml`, the Tomcat configuration file.
