Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-7850:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw present in the FreeIPA Web UI. The specific issue is that user input within the breadcrumb navigation is not properly escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XSS:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization in the breadcrumb navigation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with lower privileges, such as sudo rights, could use this XSS flaw to escalate their privileges to full administrator. This is achieved by injecting scripts that manipulate the UI or session to perform actions they are not normally authorized to do.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the user's browser session, leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web UI:** The vulnerability is located in the Web UI component of FreeIPA.
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through manipulating user input that is displayed within the breadcrumb navigation of the Web UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the FreeIPA system.
- **Lower Privileges:** The attacker needs to be a user with lower privileges, such as sudo rights, that are not equivalent to the full administrator.

**Additional Notes:**
-  The vulnerability was fixed in FreeIPA versions 4.1.2 and later.
- The issue does not affect versions of IPA as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7 because they don't include the vulnerable Web UI code.
- The issue was tracked upstream as ticket 4742 at fedorahosted.org.
