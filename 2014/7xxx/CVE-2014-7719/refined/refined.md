{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificate on SSL/TLS connections (CWE-295)",
      "Missing Proper Certificate Validation (CWE-296)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to perform a MITM attack."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content includes a link to a spreadsheet with a list of affected applications and their status. The vulnerability is due to applications not properly validating the SSL certificate chain when communicating over HTTPS. This allows attackers to intercept and modify data. The document also highlights the risk of using untrusted networks."
