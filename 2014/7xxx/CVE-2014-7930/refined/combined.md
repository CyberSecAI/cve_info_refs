Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2015/01/stable-update.html "Stable Channel Update")

Wednesday, January 21, 2015

The Chrome team is delighted to announce the promotion of Chrome 40 to the stable channel for Windows, Mac and Linux. Chrome 40.0.2214.91 contains a number of fixes and improvements, including:

* Updated info dialog for Chrome app on Windows and Linux.
* A new clock behind/ahead error message.

A partial list of changes is available in the [log](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2Blog/39.0.2171.0..40.0.2214.0?pretty=fuller&n=10000).

**Security Fixes and Rewards**

*Note: Access to bug details and links may be kept restricted until a majority of users are updated with a fix. We will also retain restrictions if the bug exists in a third party library that other projects similarly depend on, but haven’t yet fixed.*

This update includes [62 security fixes](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3Abug-security+label%3ARelease-0-M40&sort=id+-security_severity+-secseverity+-owner+-modified&colspec=ID+Pri+Status+Summary+Modified+OS+M+Security_severity+Security_impact+Owner+Reporter&cells=tiles).

We would also like to thank *Atte Kettunen of OUSPG, Christian Holler, cloudfuzzer and Khalil Zhani* for working with us during the development cycle to prevent security bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. $35000 in additional rewards were issued.

As usual, our ongoing internal security work was responsible for a wide range of fixes

* [[449894](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=449894)] CVE-2015-1205: Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives.
* Multiple vulnerabilities in V8 fixed at the tip of the 3.30 branch (currently 3.30.33.15).

Many of the above bugs were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer) or [MemorySanitizer](https://code.google.com/p/memory-sanitizer/wiki/MemorySanitizer).

## Details

Several memory corruption bugs were discovered in ICU. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2014-7923](/security/CVE-2014-7923), [CVE-2014-7926](/security/CVE-2014-7926))

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2014-7924](/security/CVE-2014-7924))

A use-after free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in Blink.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7925](/security/CVE-2014-7925))

Several memory corruption bugs were discovered in V8. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2014-7927](/security/CVE-2014-7927), [CVE-2014-7928](/security/CVE-2014-7928), [CVE-2014-7931](/security/CVE-2014-7931))

Several use-after free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7929](/security/CVE-2014-7929), [CVE-2014-7930](/security/CVE-2014-7930), [CVE-2014-7932](/security/CVE-2014-7932),

[CVE-2014-7934](/security/CVE-2014-7934))

A use-after free was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7933](/security/CVE-2014-7933))

Multiple off-by-one errors were discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2014-7937](/security/CVE-2014-7937))

A memory corruption bug was discovered in the fonts implementation. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2014-7938](/security/CVE-2014-7938))

It was discovered that ICU did not initialize memory for a data structure

correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7940](/security/CVE-2014-7940))

It was discovered that the fonts implementation did not initialize memory

for a data structure correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7942](/security/CVE-2014-7942))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2014-7943](/security/CVE-2014-7943))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2014-7946](/security/CVE-2014-7946))

It was discovered that the AppCache proceeded with caching for SSL

sessions even if there is a certificate error. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this by conducting a MITM attack to modify HTML

application content. ([CVE-2014-7948](/security/CVE-2014-7948))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1205](/security/CVE-2015-1205))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1346](/security/CVE-2015-1346))
