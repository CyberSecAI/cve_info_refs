```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not validate the "tabsel" parameter in the URL "/admin/launch?script=rh&template=sys-users&tabsel=".
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input validation on the "tabsel" parameter.
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows an attacker to change the password of an admin user without consent.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - XSS: Allows the execution of arbitrary HTML/script code in the context of the victim user's browser, which could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    - CSRF: Allows a remote attacker to change the password of the admin user without their consent.
- Attack vectors:
    - XSS: By crafting a malicious URL that includes JavaScript in the "tabsel" parameter and tricking a user into clicking the link.
    - CSRF: By creating a malicious web page that submits a form with the necessary parameters to change the admin password on the vulnerable application, and tricking a logged in admin to visit the malicious page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target device.
    - The administrator needs to be authenticated to the device for the CSRF attack to work.
