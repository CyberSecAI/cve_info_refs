iwlwifi: fix RFkill while calibrating
commit 31b8b343e019e0a0c57ca9c13520a87f9cab884b upstream.
If the RFkill interrupt fires while we calibrate, it would
make the firmware fail and the driver wasn't able to recover.
Change the flow so that the driver will kill the firmware
in that case.
Since we have now two flows that are calling
trans\_stop\_device (the RFkill interrupt and the
op\_mode\_mvm\_start function) - we need to better sync this.
Use the STATUS\_DEVICE\_ENABLED in the pcie transport in an
atomic way to achieve this.

KEYS: Reinstate EPERM for a key type name beginning with a '.'
commit 54e2c2c1a9d6cbb270b0999a38545fa9a69bee43 upstream.
Reinstate the generation of EPERM for a key type name beginning with a '.' in
a userspace call. Types whose name begins with a '.' are internal only.
The test was removed by:

Subject: KEYS: special dot prefixed keyring name bug fix
I think we want to keep the restriction on type name so that userspace can't
add keys of a special internal type.
Note that removal of the test causes several of the tests in the keyutils
testsuite to fail.

net: sctp: fix skb\_over\_panic when receiving malformed ASCONF chunks

Commit 6f4c618ddb0 ("SCTP : Add paramters validity check for

it is still possible to remotely crash a server by sending a
special crafted ASCONF chunk, even up to pre 2.6.12 kernels:

This can be triggered e.g., through a simple scripted nmap
connection scan injecting the chunk after the handshake, for
example, ...
-------------- INIT[ASCONF; ASCONF\_ACK] ------------->
<----------- INIT-ACK[ASCONF; ASCONF\_ACK] ------------
-------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
<-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
------------------ ASCONF; UNKNOWN ------------------>
... where ASCONF chunk of length 280 contains 2 parameters ...
1) Add IP address parameter (param length: 16)
2) Add/del IP address parameter (param length: 255)
... followed by an UNKNOWN chunk of e.g. 4 bytes. Here, the
Address Parameter in the ASCONF chunk is even missing, too.
This is just an example and similarly-crafted ASCONF chunks
could be used just as well.
The ASCONF chunk passes through sctp\_verify\_asconf() as all
parameters passed sanity checks, and after walking, we ended
up successfully at the chunk end boundary, and thus may invoke
sctp\_process\_asconf(). Parameter walking is done with
WORD\_ROUND() to take padding into account.
In sctp\_process\_asconf()'s TLV processing, we may fail in
sctp\_process\_asconf\_param() e.g., due to removal of the IP
address that is also the source address of the packet containing
the ASCONF chunk, and thus we need to add all TLVs after the
failure to our ASCONF response to remote via helper function
sctp\_add\_asconf\_response(), which basically invokes a
sctp\_addto\_chunk() adding the error parameters to the given
skb.
When walking to the next parameter this time, we proceed
with ...
length = ntohs(asconf\_param->param\_hdr.length);
asconf\_param = (void \*)asconf\_param + length;
... instead of the WORD\_ROUND()'ed length, thus resulting here
in an off-by-one that leads to reading the follow-up garbage
parameter length of 12336, and thus throwing an skb\_over\_panic
for the reply when trying to sctp\_addto\_chunk() next time,
which implicitly calls the skb\_put() with that length.
Fix it by using sctp\_walk\_params() [ which is also used in
INIT parameter processing ] macro in the verification \*and\*
in ASCONF processing: it will make sure we don't spill over,
that we walk parameters WORD\_ROUND()'ed. Moreover, we're being
more defensive and guard against unknown parameter types and
missized addresses.

net: sctp: fix panic on duplicate ASCONF chunks
commit b69040d8e39f20d5215a03502a8e8b4c6ab78395 upstream.
When receiving a e.g. semi-good formed connection scan in the
form of ...
-------------- INIT[ASCONF; ASCONF\_ACK] ------------->
<----------- INIT-ACK[ASCONF; ASCONF\_ACK] ------------
-------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
<-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
---------------- ASCONF\_a; ASCONF\_b ----------------->
... where ASCONF\_a equals ASCONF\_b chunk (at least both serials
need to be equal), we panic an SCTP server!
The problem is that good-formed ASCONF chunks that we reply with
ASCONF\_ACK chunks are cached per serial. Thus, when we receive a
same ASCONF chunk twice (e.g. through a lost ASCONF\_ACK), we do
not need to process them again on the server side (that was the
idea, also proposed in the RFC). Instead, we know it was cached
and we just resend the cached chunk instead. So far, so good.
Where things get nasty is in SCTP's side effect interpreter, that
is, sctp\_cmd\_interpreter():
While incoming ASCONF\_a (chunk = event\_arg) is being marked
!end\_of\_packet and !singleton, and we have an association context,
we do not flush the outqueue the first time after processing the
ASCONF\_ACK singleton chunk via SCTP\_CMD\_REPLY. Instead, we keep it
queued up, although we set local\_cork to 1. Commit 2e3216cd54b1
changed the precedence, so that as long as we get bundled, incoming
chunks we try possible bundling on outgoing queue as well. Before
this commit, we would just flush the output queue.
Now, while ASCONF\_a's ASCONF\_ACK sits in the corked outq, we
continue to process the same ASCONF\_b chunk from the packet. As
we have cached the previous ASCONF\_ACK, we find it, grab it and
do another SCTP\_CMD\_REPLY command on it. So, effectively, we rip
the chunk->list pointers and requeue the same ASCONF\_ACK chunk
another time. Since we process ASCONF\_b, it's correctly marked
with end\_of\_packet and we enforce an uncork, and thus flush, thus
crashing the kernel.
Fix it by testing if the ASCONF\_ACK is currently pending and if
that is the case, do not requeue it. When flushing the output
queue we may relink the chunk for preparing an outgoing packet,
but eventually unlink it when it's copied into the skb right
before transmission.

net: sctp: fix remote memory pressure from excessive queueing
commit 26b87c7881006311828bb0ab271a551a62dcceb4 upstream.
This scenario is not limited to ASCONF, just taken as one
example triggering the issue. When receiving ASCONF probes
in the form of ...
-------------- INIT[ASCONF; ASCONF\_ACK] ------------->
<----------- INIT-ACK[ASCONF; ASCONF\_ACK] ------------
-------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
<-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
---- ASCONF\_a; [ASCONF\_b; ...; ASCONF\_n;] JUNK ------>
[...]
---- ASCONF\_m; [ASCONF\_o; ...; ASCONF\_z;] JUNK ------>
... where ASCONF\_a, ASCONF\_b, ..., ASCONF\_z are good-formed
ASCONFs and have increasing serial numbers, we process such
ASCONF chunk(s) marked with !end\_of\_packet and !singleton,
since we have not yet reached the SCTP packet end. SCTP does
only do verification on a chunk by chunk basis, as an SCTP
packet is nothing more than just a container of a stream of
chunks which it eats up one by one.
We could run into the case that we receive a packet with a
malformed tail, above marked as trailing JUNK. All previous
chunks are here goodformed, so the stack will eat up all
previous chunks up to this point. In case JUNK does not fit
into a chunk header and there are no more other chunks in
the input queue, or in case JUNK contains a garbage chunk
header, but the encoded chunk length would exceed the skb
tail, or we came here from an entirely different scenario
and the chunk has pdiscard=1 mark (without having had a flush
point), it will happen, that we will excessively queue up
the association's output queue (a correct final chunk may
then turn it into a response flood when flushing the
queue ;)): I ran a simple script with incremental ASCONF
serial numbers and could see the server side consuming
excessive amount of RAM [before/after: up to 2GB and more].
The issue at heart is that the chunk train basically ends
with !end\_of\_packet and !singleton markers and since commit
2e3216cd54b1 ("sctp: Follow security requirement of responding
with 1 packet") therefore preventing an output queue flush
point in sctp\_do\_sm() -> sctp\_cmd\_interpreter() on the input
chunk (chunk = event\_arg) even though local\_cork is set,
but its precedence has changed since then. In the normal
case, the last chunk with end\_of\_packet=1 would trigger the
queue flush to accommodate possible outgoing bundling.
In the input queue, sctp\_inq\_pop() seems to do the right thing
in terms of discarding invalid chunks. So, above JUNK will
not enter the state machine and instead be released and exit
the sctp\_assoc\_bh\_rcv() chunk processing loop. It's simply
the flush point being missing at loop exit. Adding a try-flush
approach on the output queue might not work as the underlying
infrastructure might be long gone at this point due to the
side-effect interpreter run.
One possibility, albeit a bit of a kludge, would be to defer
invalid chunk freeing into the state machine in order to
possibly trigger packet discards and thus indirectly a queue
flush on error. It would surely be better to discard chunks
as in the current, perhaps better controlled environment, but
going back and forth, it's simply architecturally not possible.
I tried various trailing JUNK attack cases and it seems to
look good now.

KVM: x86: Don't report guest userspace emulation error to userspace

Commit fc3a9157d314 ("KVM: X86: Don't report L2 emulation failures to

userspace due to race-condition between a vmexit and the instruction emulator.
The same rational applies also to userspace applications that are permitted by
the guest OS to access MMIO area or perform PIO.
This patch extends the current behavior - of injecting a #UD instead of
reporting it to userspace - also for guest userspace code.

mm, thp: fix collapsing of hugepages on madvise
commit 6d50e60cd2edb5a57154db5a6f64eef5aa59b751 upstream.
If an anonymous mapping is not allowed to fault thp memory and then
madvise(MADV\_HUGEPAGE) is used after fault, khugepaged will never
collapse this memory into thp memory.
This occurs because the madvise(2) handler for thp, hugepage\_madvise(),
clears VM\_NOHUGEPAGE on the stack and it isn't stored in vma->vm\_flags
until the final action of madvise\_behavior(). This causes the
khugepaged\_enter\_vma\_merge() to be a no-op in hugepage\_madvise() when
the vma had previously had VM\_NOHUGEPAGE set.
Fix this by passing the correct vma flags to the khugepaged mm slot
handler. There's no chance khugepaged can run on this vma until after
madvise\_behavior() returns since we hold mm->mmap\_sem.
It would be possible to clear VM\_NOHUGEPAGE directly from vma->vm\_flags
in hugepage\_advise(), but I didn't want to introduce special case
behavior into madvise\_behavior(). I think it's best to just let it
always set vma->vm\_flags itself.

rcu: Use rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake() to wake up grace period kthreads
commit 2aa792e6faf1a00f5accf1f69e87e11a390ba2cd upstream.
The rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake() function checks for three conditions before
waking up grace period kthreads:
\* Is the thread we are trying to wake up the current thread?
\* Are the gp\_flags zero? (all threads wait on non-zero gp\_flags condition)
\* Is there no thread created for this flavour, hence nothing to wake up?
If any one of these condition is true, we do not call wake\_up().
It was found that there are quite a few avoidable wake ups both during
idle time and under stress induced by rcutorture.
Idle:
Total:66000, unnecessary:66000, case1:61827, case2:66000, case3:0
Total:68000, unnecessary:68000, case1:63696, case2:68000, case3:0
rcutorture:
Total:254000, unnecessary:254000, case1:199913, case2:254000, case3:0
Total:256000, unnecessary:256000, case1:201784, case2:256000, case3:0
Here case{1-3} are the cases listed above. We can avoid these wake
ups by using rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake() to conditionally wake up the grace
period kthreads.
There is a comment about an implied barrier supplied by the wake\_up()
logic. This barrier is necessary for the awakened thread to see the
updated ->gp\_flags. This flag is always being updated with the root node
lock held. Also, the awakened thread tries to acquire the root node lock
before reading ->gp\_flags because of which there is proper ordering.
Hence this commit tries to avoid calling wake\_up() whenever we can by
using rcu\_gp\_kthread\_wake() function.

GFS2: Make rename not save dirent location
commit 19aeb5a65f1a6504fc665466c188241e7393d66f upstream.
This patch fixes a regression in the patch "GFS2: Remember directory
insert point", commit 2b47dad866d04f14c328f888ba5406057b8c7d33.
The problem had to do with the rename function: The function found
space for the new dirent, and remembered that location. But then the
old dirent was removed, which often moved the eligible location for
the renamed dirent. Putting the new dirent at the saved location
caused file system corruption.
This patch adds a new "save\_loc" variable to struct gfs2\_diradd.
If 1, the dirent location is saved. If 0, the dirent location is not
saved and the buffer\_head is released as per previous behavior.

commit c1e7dc91eed0ed1a51c9b814d648db18bf8fc6e9 upstream.
don't try to queue payloads > 0xffff - NLA\_HDRLEN, it does not work.
The nla length includes the size of the nla struct, so anything larger
results in u16 integer overflow.
This patch is similar to

netfilter: nf\_log: account for size of NLMSG\_DONE attribute
commit 9dfa1dfe4d5e5e66a991321ab08afe69759d797a upstream.
We currently neither account for the nlattr size, nor do we consider
the size of the trailing NLMSG\_DONE when allocating nlmsg skb.
This can result in nflog to stop working, as \_\_nfulnl\_send() re-tries
sending forever if it failed to append NLMSG\_DONE (which will never
work if buffer is not large enough).

net: systemport: reset UniMAC coming out of a suspend cycle
commit 704d33e7006f20f9b4fa7d24a0f08c4b5919b131 upstream.
bcm\_sysport\_resume() was missing an UniMAC reset which can lead to
various receive FIFO corruptions coming out of a suspend cycle. If the
RX FIFO is stuck, it will deliver corrupted/duplicate packets towards
the host CPU interface.
This could be reproduced on crowded network and when Wake-on-LAN is
enabled for this particular interface because the switch still forwards
packets towards the host CPU interface (SYSTEMPORT), and we had to leave
the UniMAC RX enable bit on to allow matching MagicPackets.
Once we re-enter the resume function, there is a small window during
which the UniMAC receive is still enabled, and we start queueing
packets, but the RDMA and RBUF engines are not ready, which leads to
having packets stuck in the UniMAC RX FIFO, ultimately delivered towards
the host CPU as corrupted.

net: systemport: enable RX interrupts after NAPI
commit 8edf0047f4b8e03d94ef88f5a7dec146cce03a06 upstream.
There is currently a small window during which the SYSTEMPORT adapter
enables its RX interrupts without having enabled its NAPI handler, which
can result in packets to be discarded during interface bringup.
A similar but more serious window exists in bcm\_sysport\_resume() during
which we can have the RDMA engine not fully prepared to receive packets
and yet having RX interrupts enabled.
Fix this my moving the RX interrupt enable down to
bcm\_sysport\_netif\_start() after napi\_enable() for the RX path is called,
which fixes both call sites: bcm\_sysport\_open() and
bcm\_sysport\_resume().

NFSv4.1: nfs41\_clear\_delegation\_stateid shouldn't trust NFS\_DELEGATED\_STATE
commit 0c116cadd94b16b30b1dd90d38b2784d9b39b01a upstream.
This patch removes the assumption made previously, that we only need to
check the delegation stateid when it matches the stateid on a cached
open.
If we believe that we hold a delegation for this file, then we must assume
that its stateid may have been revoked or expired too. If we don't test it
then our state recovery process may end up caching open/lock state in a
situation where it should not.
We therefore rename the function nfs41\_clear\_delegation\_stateid as
nfs41\_check\_delegation\_stateid, and change it to always run through the
delegation stateid test and recovery process as outlined in RFC5661.

NFSv4: Fix races between nfs\_remove\_bad\_delegation() and delegation return
commit 869f9dfa4d6d57b79e0afc3af14772c2a023eeb1 upstream.
Any attempt to call nfs\_remove\_bad\_delegation() while a delegation is being
returned is currently a no-op. This means that we can end up looping
forever in nfs\_end\_delegation\_return() if something causes the delegation
to be revoked.
This patch adds a mechanism whereby the state recovery code can communicate
to the delegation return code that the delegation is no longer valid and
that it should not be used when reclaiming state.
It also changes the return value for nfs4\_handle\_delegation\_recall\_error()
to ensure that nfs\_end\_delegation\_return() does not reattempt the lock
reclaim before state recovery is done.

So when we clear \_FROZEN, we must set \_NEEDED and ensure that

Otherwise we could miss out on something that is needed.
In particular, this can make it impossible to remove a
failed device from an array is the 'recovery-needed' processing

x86, kaslr: Prevent .bss from overlaping initrd
commit e6023367d779060fddc9a52d1f474085b2b36298 upstream.
When choosing a random address, the current implementation does not take into
account the reversed space for .bss and .brk sections. Thus the relocated kernel
may overlap other components in memory. Here is an example of the overlap from a
x86\_64 kernel in qemu (the ranges of physical addresses are presented):
Physical Address
0x0fe00000 --+--------------------+ <-- randomized base
/ | relocated kernel |
vmlinux.bin | (from vmlinux.bin) |
0x1336d000 (an ELF file) +--------------------+--
\ | | \
0x1376d870 --+--------------------+ |
| relocs table | |
0x13c1c2a8 +--------------------+ .bss and .brk
| | |
0x13ce6000 +--------------------+ |
| | /
0x13f77000 | initrd |--
| |
0x13fef374 +--------------------+
The initrd image will then be overwritten by the memset during early
initialization:
[ 1.655204] Unpacking initramfs...
[ 1.662831] Initramfs unpacking failed: junk in compressed archive
This patch prevents the above situation by requiring a larger space when looking
for a random kernel base, so that existing logic can effectively avoids the
overlap.

box. As it turns out, in save\_microcode\_in\_initrd\_amd() we're using the
\*physical\* address of the container \*after\* we have enabled paging and
thus we #PF in load\_microcode\_amd() when trying to access the microcode
container in the ramdisk range.
Because the ramdisk is exactly there:
[ 0.000000] RAMDISK: [mem 0x35e04000-0x36ef9fff]
and we fault at 0x35e04304.
And since this guest doesn't relocate the ramdisk, we don't do the
computation which will give us the correct virtual address and we end up
with the PA.
So, we should actually be using virtual addresses on 32-bit too by the
time we're freeing the initrd. Do that then!

power: bq2415x\_charger: Fix memory leak on DTS parsing error
commit 21e863b233553998737e1b506c823a00bf012e00 upstream.
Memory allocated for 'name' was leaking if required binding properties
were not present.
The memory for 'name' was allocated early at probe with kasprintf(). It
was freed in error paths executed before and after parsing DTS but not
in that error path.
Fix the error path for parsing device tree properties.

power: bq2415x\_charger: Properly handle ENODEV from power\_supply\_get\_by\_phandle
commit 0eaf437aa14949d2230aeab7364f4ab47901304a upstream.
The power\_supply\_get\_by\_phandle() on error returns ENODEV or NULL.
The driver later expects obtained pointer to power supply to be
valid or NULL. If it is not NULL then it dereferences it in
bq2415x\_notifier\_call() which would lead to dereferencing ENODEV-value
pointer.
Properly handle the power\_supply\_get\_by\_phandle() error case by
replacing error value with NULL. This indicates that usb charger
detection won't be used.
Fix also memory leak of 'name' if power\_supply\_get\_by\_phandle() fails
with NULL and probe should defer.

power: charger-manager: Fix accessing invalidated power supply after charger unbind
commit cdaf3e15385d3232b52287e50692506f8fd01a09 upstream.
The charger manager obtained in probe references to power supplies for
all chargers with power\_supply\_get\_by\_name() for later usage. However
if such charger driver was removed then this reference would point to
old power supply (from driver which was removed).
This lead to accessing invalid memory which could be observed with:

power: charger-manager: Fix accessing invalidated power supply after fuel gauge unbind
commit bdbe81445407644492b9ac69a24d35e3202d773b upstream.
The charger manager obtained reference to fuel gauge power supply in probe
with power\_supply\_get\_by\_name() for later usage. However if fuel gauge
driver was removed and re-added then this reference would point to old
power supply (from driver which was removed).
This lead to accessing old (and probably invalid) memory which could be
observed with:

The charger-manager should get reference to fuel gauge power supply on
each use of get\_property callback. The thermal zone 'tzd' field of
power supply should not be used because of the same reason.
Additionally this change solves also the issue with nested
thermal\_zone\_get\_temp() calls and related false lockdep positive for
deadlock for thermal zone's mutex [1]. When fuel gauge is used as source of
temperature then the charger manager forwards its get\_temp calls to fuel
gauge thermal zone. So actually different mutexes are used (one for
charger manager thermal zone and second for fuel gauge thermal zone) but
for lockdep this is one class of mutex.
The recursion is removed by retrieving temperature through power
supply's get\_property().
In case external thermal zone is used ('cm-thermal-zone' property is
present in DTS) the recursion does not exist. Charger manager simply
exports POWER\_SUPPLY\_PROP\_TEMP\_AMBIENT property (instead of
POWER\_SUPPLY\_PROP\_TEMP) thus no thermal zone is created for this power
supply.

Sleeping under the rcu\_read\_lock is bad. This patch fixes it by dropping
the rcu\_read\_lock before doing the allocation and then reacquiring it
and redoing the dereference before doing the copy. If we find that the
string has somehow grown in the meantime, we'll reallocate and try again.

Input: alps - ignore bad data on Dell Latitudes E6440 and E7440
commit a7ef82aee91f26da79b981b9f5bca43b8817d3e4 upstream.
Sometimes on Dell Latitude laptops psmouse/alps driver receive invalid ALPS
protocol V3 packets with bit7 set in last byte. More often it can be
reproduced on Dell Latitude E6440 or E7440 with closed lid and pushing
cover above touchpad.
If bit7 in last packet byte is set then it is not valid ALPS packet. I was
told that ALPS devices never send these packets. It is not know yet who
send those packets, it could be Dell EC, bug in BIOS and also bug in
touchpad firmware...
With this patch alps driver does not process those invalid packets, but
instead of reporting PSMOUSE\_BAD\_DATA, getting into out of sync state,
getting back in sync with the next byte and spam dmesg we return
PSMOUSE\_FULL\_PACKET. If driver is truly out of sync we'll fail the checks
on the next byte and report PSMOUSE\_BAD\_DATA then.

Input: alps - allow up to 2 invalid packets without resetting device
commit 9d720b34c0a432639252f63012e18b0507f5b432 upstream.
On some Dell Latitude laptops ALPS device or Dell EC send one invalid byte
in 6 bytes ALPS packet. In this case psmouse driver enter out of sync
state. It looks like that all other bytes in packets are valid and also
device working properly. So there is no need to do full device reset, just
need to wait for byte which match condition for first byte (start of
packet). Because ALPS packets are bigger (6 or 8 bytes) default limit is
small.
This patch increase number of invalid bytes to size of 2 ALPS packets which
psmouse driver can drop before do full reset.
Resetting ALPS devices take some time and when doing reset on some Dell
laptops touchpad, trackstick and also keyboard do not respond. So it is
better to do it only if really necessary.

Input: alps - ignore potential bare packets when device is out of sync
commit 4ab8f7f320f91f279c3f06a9795cfea5c972888a upstream.
5th and 6th byte of ALPS trackstick V3 protocol match condition for first
byte of PS/2 3 bytes packet. When driver enters out of sync state and ALPS
trackstick is sending data then driver match 5th, 6th and next 1st bytes as
PS/2.
It basically means if user is using trackstick when driver is in out of
sync state driver will never resync. Processing these bytes as 3 bytes PS/2
data cause total mess (random cursor movements, random clicks) and make
trackstick unusable until psmouse driver decide to do full device reset.
Lot of users reported problems with ALPS devices on Dell Latitude E6440,
E6540 and E7440 laptops. ALPS device or Dell EC for unknown reason send
some invalid ALPS PS/2 bytes which cause driver out of sync. It looks like
that i8042 and psmouse/alps driver always receive group of 6 bytes packets
so there are no missing bytes and no bytes were inserted between valid
ones.
This patch does not fix root of problem with ALPS devices found in Dell
Latitude laptops but it does not allow to process some (invalid)
subsequence of 6 bytes ALPS packets as 3 bytes PS/2 when driver is out of
sync.
So with this patch trackstick input device does not report bogus data when
also driver is out of sync, so trackstick should be usable on those
machines.

dm raid: ensure superblock's size matches device's logical block size
commit 40d43c4b4cac4c2647bf07110d7b07d35f399a84 upstream.
The dm-raid superblock (struct dm\_raid\_superblock) is padded to 512
bytes and that size is being used to read it in from the metadata
device into one preallocated page.
Reading or writing this on a 512-byte sector device works fine but on
a 4096-byte sector device this fails.
Set the dm-raid superblock's size to the logical block size of the
metadata device, because IO at that size is guaranteed too work. Also
add a size check to avoid silent partial metadata loss in case the
superblock should ever grow past the logical block size or PAGE\_SIZE.

dm btree: fix a recursion depth bug in btree walking code
commit 9b460d3699324d570a4d4161c3741431887f102f upstream.
The walk code was using a 'ro\_spine' to hold it's locked btree nodes.
But this data structure is designed for the rolling lock scheme, and
as such automatically unlocks blocks that are two steps up the call
chain. This is not suitable for the simple recursive walk algorithm,
which retraces its steps.
This code is only used by the persistent array code, which in turn is
only used by dm-cache. In order to trigger it you need to have a
mapping tree that is more than 2 levels deep; which equates to 8-16
million cache blocks. For instance a 4T ssd with a very small block
size of 32k only just triggers this bug.
The fix just places the locked blocks on the stack, and stops using
the ro\_spine altogether.

dm bufio: change \_\_GFP\_IO to \_\_GFP\_FS in shrinker callbacks
commit 9d28eb12447ee08bb5d1e8bb3195cf20e1ecd1c0 upstream.
The shrinker uses gfp flags to indicate what kind of operation can the
driver wait for. If \_\_GFP\_IO flag is present, the driver can wait for
block I/O operations, if \_\_GFP\_FS flag is present, the driver can wait on
operations involving the filesystem.
dm-bufio tested for \_\_GFP\_IO. However, dm-bufio can run on a loop block
device that makes calls into the filesystem. If \_\_GFP\_IO is present and
\_\_GFP\_FS isn't, dm-bufio could still block on filesystem operations if it
runs on a loop block device.
The change from \_\_GFP\_IO to \_\_GFP\_FS supposedly fixes one observed (though
unreproducible) deadlock involving dm-bufio and loop device.

Switch over the msgctl, shmat, shmctl and semtimedop syscalls to use the compat
layer. The problem was found with the debian procenv package, which called
shmctl(0, SHM\_INFO, &info);
in which the shmctl syscall then overwrote parts of the surrounding areas on
the stack on which the info variable was stored and thus lead to a segfault
later on.
Additionally fix the definition of struct shminfo64 to use unsigned longs like

Correct the race condition in aarch64\_insn\_patch\_text\_sync()
commit 899d5933b2dd2720f2b20b01eaa07871aa6ad096 upstream.
When experimenting with patches to provide kprobes support for aarch64
smp machines would hang when inserting breakpoints into kernel code.
The hangs were caused by a race condition in the code called by
aarch64\_insn\_patch\_text\_sync(). The first processor in the
aarch64\_insn\_patch\_text\_cb() function would patch the code while other
processors were still entering the function and incrementing the
cpu\_count field. This resulted in some processors never observing the
exit condition and exiting the function. Thus, processors in the
system hung.
The first processor to enter the patching function performs the
patching and signals that the patching is complete with an increment
of the cpu\_count field. When all the processors have incremented the
cpu\_count field the cpu\_count will be num\_cpus\_online()+1 and they
will return to normal execution.

For pNFS direct writes, layout driver may dynamically allocate ds\_cinfo.buckets.
So we need to take care to free them when freeing dreq.
Ideally this needs to be done inside layout driver where ds\_cinfo.buckets
are allocated. But buckets are attached to dreq and reused across LD IO iterations.
So I feel it's OK to free them in the generic layer.

firewire: cdev: prevent kernel stack leaking into ioctl arguments
commit eaca2d8e75e90a70a63a6695c9f61932609db212 upstream.
Found by the UC-KLEE tool: A user could supply less input to
firewire-cdev ioctls than write- or write/read-type ioctl handlers
expect. The handlers used data from uninitialized kernel stack then.
This could partially leak back to the user if the kernel subsequently
generated fw\_cdev\_event\_'s (to be read from the firewire-cdev fd)
which notably would contain the \_u64 closure field which many of the
ioctl argument structures contain.
The fact that the handlers would act on random garbage input is a
lesser issue since all handlers must check their input anyway.
The fix simply always null-initializes the entire ioctl argument buffer
regardless of the actual length of expected user input. That is, a
runtime overhead of memset(..., 40) is added to each firewirew-cdev
ioctl() call. [Comment from Clemens Ladisch: This part of the stack is
most likely to be already in the cache.]
Remarks:
- There was never any leak from kernel stack to the ioctl output
buffer itself. IOW, it was not possible to read kernel stack by a
read-type or write/read-type ioctl alone; the leak could at most
happen in combination with read()ing subsequent event data.
- The actual expected minimum user input of each ioctl from
include/uapi/linux/firewire-cdev.h is, in bytes:
[0x00] = 32, [0x05] = 4, [0x0a] = 16, [0x0f] = 20, [0x14] = 16,
[0x01] = 36, [0x06] = 20, [0x0b] = 4, [0x10] = 20, [0x15] = 20,
[0x02] = 20, [0x07] = 4, [0x0c] = 0, [0x11] = 0, [0x16] = 8,
[0x03] = 4, [0x08] = 24, [0x0d] = 20, [0x12] = 36, [0x17] = 12,
[0x04] = 20, [0x09] = 24, [0x0e] = 4, [0x13] = 40, [0x18] = 4.

arm64: efi: Fix stub cache maintenance
commit 9b0b26580a753d4d6bdd2b8b4ca9a8f3f2d39065 upstream.
While efi-entry.S mentions that efi\_entry() will have relocated the
kernel image, it actually means that efi\_entry will have placed a copy
of the kernel in the appropriate location, and until this is branched to
at the end of efi\_entry.S, all instructions are executed from the
original image.
Thus while the flush in efi\_entry.S does ensure that the copy is visible
to noncacheable accesses, it does not guarantee that this is true for
the image instructions are being executed from. This could have
disasterous effects when the MMU and caches are disabled if the image
has not been naturally evicted to the PoC.
Additionally, due to a missing dsb following the ic ialluis, the new
kernel image is not necessarily clean in the I-cache when it is branched
to, with similar potentially disasterous effects.
This patch adds additional flushing to ensure that the currently
executing stub text is flushed to the PoC and is thus visible to
noncacheable accesses. As it is placed after the instructions cache
maintenance for the new image and \_\_flush\_dcache\_area already contains a
dsb, we do not need to add a separate barrier to ensure completion of
the icache maintenance.
Comments are updated to clarify the situation with regard to the two
images and the maintenance required for both.

arm64: \_\_clear\_user: handle exceptions on strb
commit 97fc15436b36ee3956efad83e22a557991f7d19d upstream.
ARM64 currently doesn't fix up faults on the single-byte (strb) case of
\_\_clear\_user... which means that we can cause a nasty kernel panic as an
ordinary user with any multiple PAGE\_SIZE+1 read from /dev/zero.
i.e.: dd if=/dev/zero of=foo ibs=1 count=1 (or ibs=65537, etc.)
This is a pretty obscure bug in the general case since we'll only
\_\_do\_kernel\_fault (since there's no extable entry for pc) if the
mmap\_sem is contended. However, with CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM enabled, we'll
always fault.
if (!down\_read\_trylock(&mm->mmap\_sem)) {
if (!user\_mode(regs) && !search\_exception\_tables(regs->pc))
goto no\_context;
retry:
down\_read(&mm->mmap\_sem);
} else {
/\*
\* The above down\_read\_trylock() might have succeeded in
\* which
\* case, we'll have missed the might\_sleep() from
\* down\_read().
\*/
might\_sleep();
if (!user\_mode(regs) && !search\_exception\_tables(regs->pc))
goto no\_context;
}
Fix that by adding an extable entry for the strb instruction, since it
touches user memory, similar to the other stores in \_\_clear\_user.

Fix thinko in iov\_iter\_single\_seg\_count
commit ad0eab9293485d1c06237e9249f6d4dfa3d93d4d upstream.
The branches of the if (i->type & ITER\_BVEC) statement in
iov\_iter\_single\_seg\_count() are the wrong way around; if ITER\_BVEC is
clear then we use i->bvec, when we should be using i->iov. This fixes
it.
In my case, the symptom that this caused was that a KVM guest doing
filesystem operations on a virtual disk would result in one of qemu's
threads on the host going into an infinite loop in
generic\_perform\_write(). The loop would hit the copied == 0 case and
call iov\_iter\_single\_seg\_count() to reduce the number of bytes to try
to process, but because of the error, iov\_iter\_single\_seg\_count()
would just return i->count and the loop made no progress and continued
forever.

ARM: mvebu: armada xp: Generalize use of i2c quirk
commit 5129ee22ce4aff7c5907d4c3d67d23f86cd6db9b upstream.
A second product has come to light which makes use of the A0 stepping
of the Armada XP SoC. A0 stepping has a hardware bug in the i2c core
meaning that hardware offload does not work, resulting in the kernel
failing to boot. The quirk detects that the kernel is running on an A0
stepping SoC and disables the use of hardware offload.
Currently the quirk is only enabled for PlatHome Openblocks AX3. The
AX3 has been produced with both A0 and B0 stepping SoCs. The second
product is the Lenovo Iomega IX4-300d. It seems likely that this
device will also swap from A0 to B0 SoC sometime during its life.
If there are two products using A0, it seems likely there are more
products with A0. Also, since the number of A0 SoCs is limited, these
products are also likely to transition to B0. Hence detecting at run
time is the safest option. So enable the quirk for all Armada XP
boards.
Tested on an AX3 with A0 stepping.

bootloader may have SCTLR.I set, which permits normal, cacheable
instruction fetches regardless of SCTLR.M).
This patch moves the cache maintenance check into the maintenance
routines themselves, allowing the v6/v7 versions to invalidate the
I-cache regardless of the MMU state.

ARM: 8198/1: make kuser helpers depend on MMU
commit 08b964ff3c51b10aaf2e6ba639f40054c09f0f7a upstream.
The kuser helpers page is not set up on non-MMU systems, so it does
not make sense to allow CONFIG\_KUSER\_HELPERS to be enabled when
CONFIG\_MMU=n. Allowing it to be set on !MMU results in an oops in
set\_tls (used in execve and the arm\_syscall trap handler):

As best I can tell this issue existed for the set\_tls ARM syscall
before commit fbfb872f5f41 "ARM: 8148/1: flush TLS and thumbee
register state during exec" consolidated the TLS manipulation code
into the set\_tls helper function, but now that we're using it to flush
register state during execve, !MMU users encounter the oops at the
first exec.
Prevent CONFIG\_MMU=n configurations from enabling
CONFIG\_KUSER\_HELPERS.

drm/radeon: add locking around atombios scratch space usage
commit 1c9498425453bb65ef339a57705c5ef59fe1541d upstream.
While developing MST support I noticed I often got the wrong data
back from a transaction, in a racy fashion. I noticed the scratch
space wasn't locked against concurrent users.
Based on a patch by Alex, but I've made it a bit more obvious when
things are locked.

drm/radeon: make sure mode init is complete in bandwidth\_update
commit 8efe82ca908400785253c8f0dfcf301e6bd93488 upstream.
The power management code calls into the display code for
certain things. If certain power management sysfs attributes
are called before the driver has finished initializing all of
the hardware we can run into problems with uninitialized
modesetting state. Add a check to make sure modesetting
init has completed to the bandwidth update callbacks to
fix this. Can be triggered by the tlp and laptop start
up scripts depending on the timing.

drm/i915: Disable caches for Global GTT.
commit d6a8b72edc92471283925ceb4ba12799b67c3ff8 upstream.
Global GTT doesn't have pat\_sel[2:0] so it always point to pat\_sel = 000;
So the only way to avoid screen corruptions is setting PAT 0 to Uncached.
MOCS can still be used though. But if userspace is trusting PTE for
cache selection the safest thing to do is to let caches disabled.
BSpec: "For GGTT, there is NO pat\_sel[2:0] from the entry,
so RTL will always use the value corresponding to pat\_sel = 000"
- System agent ggtt writes (i.e. cpu gtt mmaps) already work before
this patch, i.e. the same uncached + snooping access like on gen6/7
seems to be in effect.
- So this just fixes blitter/render access. Again it looks like it's
not just uncached access, but uncached + snooping. So we can still
hold onto all our assumptions wrt cpu clflushing on LLC machines.
v2: Cleaner patch as suggested by Chris.

mac80211: fix use-after-free in defragmentation
commit b8fff407a180286aa683d543d878d98d9fc57b13 upstream.
Upon receiving the last fragment, all but the first fragment
are freed, but the multicast check for statistics at the end
of the function refers to the current skb (the last fragment)
causing a use-after-free bug.
Since multicast frames cannot be fragmented and we check for
this early in the function, just modify that check to also
do the accounting to fix the issue.

mac80211: use secondary channel offset IE also beacons during CSA
commit 84469a45a1bedec9918e94ab2f78c5dc0739e4a7 upstream.
If we are switching from an HT40+ to an HT40- channel (or vice-versa),
we need the secondary channel offset IE to specify what is the
post-CSA offset to be used. This applies both to beacons and to probe
responses.
In ieee80211\_parse\_ch\_switch\_ie() we were ignoring this IE from
beacons and using the \*current\* HT information IE instead. This was
causing us to use the same offset as before the switch.
Fix that by using the secondary channel offset IE also for beacons and
don't ever use the pre-switch offset. Additionally, remove the
"beacon" argument from ieee80211\_parse\_ch\_switch\_ie(), since it's not
needed anymore.

mac80211: properly flush delayed scan work on interface removal
commit 46238845bd609a5c0fbe076e1b82b4c5b33360b2 upstream.
When an interface is deleted, an ongoing hardware scan is canceled and
the driver must abort the scan, at the very least reporting completion
while the interface is removed.
However, if it scheduled the work that might only run after everything
is said and done, which leads to cfg80211 warning that the scan isn't
reported as finished yet; this is no fault of the driver, it already
did, but mac80211 hasn't processed it.
To fix this situation, flush the delayed work when the interface being
removed is the one that was executing the scan.

commit 3542aed7480925eb859f7ce101982209cc19a126 upstream.
Lenovo Ideapad Z560 has a mute LED that is controlled via EAPD pin
0x1b on CX20585 codec. (EAPD bit on corresponds to mute LED on.)
The machine doesn't need other EAPD, so the fixup concentrates on
controlling EAPD 0x1b following the vmaster state (but inversely).

param: fix crash on bad kernel arguments
commit 3438cf549d2f3ee8e52c82acc8e2a9710ac21a5b upstream.
Currently if the user passes an invalid value on the kernel command line
then the kernel will crash during argument parsing. On most systems this
is very hard to debug because the console hasn't been initialized yet.
This is a regression due to commit 51e158c12aca ("param: hand arguments
after -- straight to init") which, in response to the systemd debug
controversy, made it possible to explicitly pass arguments to init. To
achieve this parse\_args() was extended from simply returning an error
code to returning a pointer. Regretably the new init args logic does not
perform a proper validity check on the pointer resulting in a crash.
This patch fixes the validity check. Should the check fail then no arguments
will be passed to init. This is reasonable and matches how the kernel treats
its own arguments (i.e. no error recovery).

tracing: Do not busy wait in buffer splice
commit e30f53aad2202b5526c40c36d8eeac8bf290bde5 upstream.
On a !PREEMPT kernel, attempting to use trace-cmd results in a soft
lockup:
# trace-cmd record -e raw\_syscalls:\* -F false
NMI watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#0 stuck for 22s! [trace-cmd:61]

Call Trace:

[] SyS\_splice+0x7c1/0x800
[] tracesys\_phase2+0xd3/0xd8
The problem is this: tracing\_buffers\_splice\_read() calls
ring\_buffer\_wait() to wait for data in the ring buffers. The buffers
are not empty so ring\_buffer\_wait() returns immediately. But
tracing\_buffers\_splice\_read() calls ring\_buffer\_read\_page() with full=1,
meaning it only wants to read a full page. When the full page is not
available, tracing\_buffers\_splice\_read() tries to wait again with
ring\_buffer\_wait(), which again returns immediately, and so on.
Fix this by adding a "full" argument to ring\_buffer\_wait() which will
make ring\_buffer\_wait() wait until the writer has left the reader's
page, i.e. until full-page reads will succeed.

operands, it will performs a memory read and overwrite op->val.
Consider for instance the ROR instruction - src2 (the number of times)
would be read from memory instead of being used as immediate.
Mark every immediate operand as such to avoid this problem.

mem-hotplug: reset node present pages when hot-adding a new pgdat
commit 0bd854200873894a76f32603ff2c4c988ad6b5b5 upstream.
When memory is hot-added, all the memory is in offline state. So clear
all zones' present\_pages because they will be updated in online\_pages()
and offline\_pages(). Otherwise, /proc/zoneinfo will corrupt:
When the memory of node2 is offline:
# cat /proc/zoneinfo
......
Node 2, zone Movable
......
spanned 8388608
present 8388608
managed 0
When we online memory on node2:
# cat /proc/zoneinfo
......
Node 2, zone Movable
......

present 16777216

mem-hotplug: reset node managed pages when hot-adding a new pgdat
commit f784a3f19613901ca4539a5b0eed3bdc700e6ee7 upstream.
In free\_area\_init\_core(), zone->managed\_pages is set to an approximate
value for lowmem, and will be adjusted when the bootmem allocator frees
pages into the buddy system.
But free\_area\_init\_core() is also called by hotadd\_new\_pgdat() when
hot-adding memory. As a result, zone->managed\_pages of the newly added
node's pgdat is set to an approximate value in the very beginning.
Even if the memory on that node has node been onlined,
/sys/device/system/node/nodeXXX/meminfo has wrong value:
hot-add node2 (memory not onlined)
cat /sys/device/system/node/node2/meminfo
Node 2 MemTotal: 33554432 kB
Node 2 MemFree: 0 kB
Node 2 MemUsed: 33554432 kB
Node 2 Active: 0 kB
This patch fixes this problem by reset node managed pages to 0 after
hot-adding a new node.
1. Move reset\_managed\_pages\_done from reset\_node\_managed\_pages() to
reset\_all\_zones\_managed\_pages()
2. Make reset\_node\_managed\_pages() non-static
3. Call reset\_node\_managed\_pages() in hotadd\_new\_pgdat() after pgdat
is initialized

hwrng: pseries - port to new read API and fix stack corruption
commit 24c65bc7037e7d0f362c0df70d17dd72ee64b8b9 upstream.
The add\_early\_randomness() function in drivers/char/hw\_random/core.c passes
a 16-byte buffer to pseries\_rng\_data\_read(). Unfortunately, plpar\_hcall()
returns four 64-bit values and trashes 16 bytes on the stack.
This bug has been lying around for a long time. It got unveiled by:

mfd: max77693: Fix always masked MUIC interrupts
commit c0acb8144bd6d8d88aee1dab33364b7353e9a903 upstream.
All interrupts coming from MUIC were ignored because interrupt source
register was masked.
The Maxim 77693 has a "interrupt source" - a separate register and interrupts
which give information about PMIC block triggering the individual
interrupt (charger, topsys, MUIC, flash LED).
By default bootloader could initialize this register to "mask all"
value. In such case (observed on Trats2 board) MUIC interrupts won't be
generated regardless of their mask status. Regmap irq chip was unmasking
individual MUIC interrupts but the source was masked
Before introducing regmap irq chip this interrupt source was unmasked,
read and acked. Reading and acking is not necessary but unmasking is.

commit 43fc9396cac3f7498e07a22e6a987b911462fa58 upstream.
Interrupts coming from Maxim77693 MUIC block (MicroUSB Interface
Controller) were not handled at all because wrong regmap was used for
MUIC's regmap\_irq\_chip.
The MUIC component of Maxim 77693 uses different I2C address thus second
regmap is created and used by max77693 extcon driver. The registers for
MUIC interrupts are also in that block and should be handled by that
second regmap.
However the regmap irq chip for MUIC was configured with default regmap
which could not read MUIC registers.

This caused poweroff command to fail on devices that have the
BCI charger on twl4030 wired, or have power wired for VBUS.
Instead of powering off, the device reboots. This is because
voltage is detected on charger or VBUS with the default bits
enabled for the power transition registers.
To fix the issue, let's just clear VBUS and CHG bits as we want
poweroff command to keep the system powered off.

mm/page\_alloc: restrict max order of merging on isolated pageblock
commit 3c605096d3158216ba9326a16266f6ba128c2c8d upstream.
Current pageblock isolation logic could isolate each pageblock
individually. This causes freepage accounting problem if freepage with
pageblock order on isolate pageblock is merged with other freepage on
normal pageblock. We can prevent merging by restricting max order of
merging to pageblock order if freepage is on isolate pageblock.
A side-effect of this change is that there could be non-merged buddy
freepage even if finishing pageblock isolation, because undoing
pageblock isolation is just to move freepage from isolate buddy list to
normal buddy list rather than to consider merging. So, the patch also
makes undoing pageblock isolation consider freepage merge. When
un-isolation, freepage with more than pageblock order and it's buddy are
checked. If they are on normal pageblock, instead of just moving, we
isolate the freepage and free it in order to get merged.

mm/page\_alloc: add freepage on isolate pageblock to correct buddy list
commit 51bb1a4093cc68bc16b282548d9cee6104be0ef1 upstream.
In free\_pcppages\_bulk(), we use cached migratetype of freepage to
determine type of buddy list where freepage will be added. This
information is stored when freepage is added to pcp list, so if
isolation of pageblock of this freepage begins after storing, this
cached information could be stale. In other words, it has original
migratetype rather than MIGRATE\_ISOLATE.
There are two problems caused by this stale information.
One is that we can't keep these freepages from being allocated.
Although this pageblock is isolated, freepage will be added to normal
buddy list so that it could be allocated without any restriction. And
the other problem is incorrect freepage accounting. Freepages on
isolate pageblock should not be counted for number of freepage.
Following is the code snippet in free\_pcppages\_bulk().
/\* MIGRATE\_MOVABLE list may include MIGRATE\_RESERVEs \*/
\_\_free\_one\_page(page, page\_to\_pfn(page), zone, 0, mt);
trace\_mm\_page\_pcpu\_drain(page, 0, mt);
if (likely(!is\_migrate\_isolate\_page(page))) {
\_\_mod\_zone\_page\_state(zone, NR\_FREE\_PAGES, 1);
if (is\_migrate\_cma(mt))
\_\_mod\_zone\_page\_state(zone, NR\_FREE\_CMA\_PAGES, 1);
}
As you can see above snippet, current code already handle second
problem, incorrect freepage accounting, by re-fetching pageblock
migratetype through is\_migrate\_isolate\_page(page).
But, because this re-fetched information isn't used for
\_\_free\_one\_page(), first problem would not be solved. This patch try to
solve this situation to re-fetch pageblock migratetype before
\_\_free\_one\_page() and to use it for \_\_free\_one\_page().
In addition to move up position of this re-fetch, this patch use
optimization technique, re-fetching migratetype only if there is isolate
pageblock. Pageblock isolation is rare event, so we can avoid
re-fetching in common case with this optimization.
This patch also correct migratetype of the tracepoint output.

mm/page\_alloc: fix incorrect isolation behavior by rechecking migratetype
commit ad53f92eb416d81e469fa8ea57153e59455e7175 upstream.
Before describing bugs itself, I first explain definition of freepage.
1. pages on buddy list are counted as freepage.
2. pages on isolate migratetype buddy list are \*not\* counted as freepage.
3. pages on cma buddy list are counted as CMA freepage, too.
Now, I describe problems and related patch.
Patch 1: There is race conditions on getting pageblock migratetype that
it results in misplacement of freepages on buddy list, incorrect
freepage count and un-availability of freepage.
Patch 2: Freepages on pcp list could have stale cached information to
determine migratetype of buddy list to go. This causes misplacement of
freepages on buddy list and incorrect freepage count.
Patch 4: Merging between freepages on different migratetype of
pageblocks will cause freepages accouting problem. This patch fixes it.
Without patchset [3], above problem doesn't happens on my CMA allocation
test, because CMA reserved pages aren't used at all. So there is no
chance for above race.
With patchset [3], I did simple CMA allocation test and get below
result:
- Virtual machine, 4 cpus, 1024 MB memory, 256 MB CMA reservation
- run kernel build (make -j16) on background
- 30 times CMA allocation(8MB \* 30 = 240MB) attempts in 5 sec interval
- Result: more than 5000 freepage count are missed
With patchset [3] and this patchset, I found that no freepage count are
missed so that I conclude that problems are solved.
On my simple memory offlining test, these problems also occur on that
environment, too.
This patch (of 4):
There are two paths to reach core free function of buddy allocator,
\_\_free\_one\_page(), one is free\_one\_page()->\_\_free\_one\_page() and the
other is free\_hot\_cold\_page()->free\_pcppages\_bulk()->\_\_free\_one\_page().
Each paths has race condition causing serious problems. At first, this
patch is focused on first type of freepath. And then, following patch
will solve the problem in second type of freepath.
In the first type of freepath, we got migratetype of freeing page
without holding the zone lock, so it could be racy. There are two cases
of this race.
1. pages are added to isolate buddy list after restoring orignal
migratetype
CPU1 CPU2
get migratetype => return MIGRATE\_ISOLATE
call free\_one\_page() with MIGRATE\_ISOLATE
grab the zone lock
unisolate pageblock
release the zone lock
grab the zone lock
call \_\_free\_one\_page() with MIGRATE\_ISOLATE
freepage go into isolate buddy list,
although pageblock is already unisolated
This may cause two problems. One is that we can't use this page anymore
until next isolation attempt of this pageblock, because freepage is on
isolate buddy list. The other is that freepage accouting could be wrong
due to merging between different buddy list. Freepages on isolate buddy
list aren't counted as freepage, but ones on normal buddy list are
counted as freepage. If merge happens, buddy freepage on normal buddy
list is inevitably moved to isolate buddy list without any consideration
of freepage accouting so it could be incorrect.
2. pages are added to normal buddy list while pageblock is isolated.
It is similar with above case.
This also may cause two problems. One is that we can't keep these
freepages from being allocated. Although this pageblock is isolated,
freepage would be added to normal buddy list so that it could be
allocated without any restriction. And the other problem is same as
case 1, that it, incorrect freepage accouting.
This race condition would be prevented by checking migratetype again
with holding the zone lock. Because it is somewhat heavy operation and
it isn't needed in common case, we want to avoid rechecking as much as
possible. So this patch introduce new variable, nr\_isolate\_pageblock in
struct zone to check if there is isolated pageblock. With this, we can
avoid to re-check migratetype in common case and do it only if there is
isolated pageblock or migratetype is MIGRATE\_ISOLATE. This solve above
mentioned problems.
Changes from v3:
Add one more check in free\_one\_page() that checks whether migratetype is
MIGRATE\_ISOLATE or not. Without this, abovementioned case 1 could happens.

sparc32: Implement xchg and atomic\_xchg using ATOMIC\_HASH locks
[ Upstream commit 1a17fdc4f4ed06b63fac1937470378a5441a663a ]
Atomicity between xchg and cmpxchg cannot be guaranteed when xchg is
implemented with a swap and cmpxchg is implemented with locks.
Without this, e.g. mcs\_spin\_lock and mcs\_spin\_unlock are broken.

====================
The problem is that pbm->pci\_bus->self is NULL.
This code is trying to go through the standard PCI config space
interfaces to read the PCI controller's PCI\_STATUS register.
This doesn't work, because we more often than not do not enumerate
the PCI controller as a bonafide PCI device during the OF device
node scan. Therefore bus->self remains NULL.
Existing common code for PSYCHO and PSYCHO-like PCI controllers
handles this properly, by doing the config space access directly.
Do the same here, pbm->pci\_ops->{read,write}().

sunvdc: don't call VD\_OP\_GET\_VTOC

The VD\_OP\_GET\_VTOC operation will succeed only if the vdisk backend has a
VTOC label, otherwise it will fail. In particular, it will return error
48 (ENOTSUP) if the disk has an EFI label. VTOC disk labels are already
handled by directly reading the disk in block/partitions/sun.c (enabled by
CONFIG\_SUN\_PARTITION which defaults to y on SPARC). Since port->label is
unused in the driver, remove the call and the field.

vio: fix reuse of vio\_dring slot
[ Upstream commit d0aedcd4f14a22e23b313f42b7e6e6ebfc0fbc31 ]
vio\_dring\_avail() will allow use of every dring entry, but when the last
entry is allocated then dr->prod == dr->cons which is indistinguishable from
the ring empty condition. This causes the next allocation to reuse an entry.
When this happens in sunvdc, the server side vds driver begins nack'ing the
messages and ends up resetting the ldc channel. This problem does not effect
sunvnet since it checks for < 2.
The fix here is to just never allocate the very last dring slot so that full
and empty are not the same condition. The request start path was changed to
check for the ring being full a bit earlier, and to stop the blk\_queue if
there is no space left. The blk\_queue will be restarted once the ring is
only half full again. The number of ring entries was increased to 512 which
matches the sunvnet and Solaris vdc drivers, and greatly reduces the
frequency of hitting the ring full condition and the associated blk\_queue
stop/starting. The checks in sunvent were adjusted to account for
vio\_dring\_avail() returning 1 less.

sunvdc: limit each sg segment to a page

ldc\_map\_sg() could fail its check that the number of pages referred to
by the sg scatterlist was <= the number of cookies.
This fixes the issue by doing a similar thing to the xen-blkfront driver,
ensuring that the scatterlist will only ever contain a segment count <=
port->ring\_cookies, and each segment will be page aligned, and <= page
size. This ensures that the scatterlist is always mappable.

sunvdc: add cdrom and v1.1 protocol support
[ Upstream commit 9bce21828d54a95143f1b74619705c2dd8e88b92 ]
Interpret the media type from v1.1 protocol to support CDROM/DVD.
For v1.0 protocol, a disk's size continues to be calculated from the
geometry returned by the vdisk server. The geometry returned by the server
can be less than the actual number of sectors available in the backing
image/device due to the rounding in the division used to compute the
geometry in the vdisk server.
In v1.1 protocol a disk's actual size in sectors is returned during the
handshake. Use this size when v1.1 protocol is negotiated. Since this size
will always be larger than the former geometry computed size, disks created
under v1.0 will be forwards compatible to v1.1, but not vice versa.

smsc911x: power-up phydev before doing a software reset.
[ Upstream commit ccf899a27c08038db91765ff12bb0380dcd85887 ]
With commit be9dad1f9f26604fb ("net: phy: suspend phydev when going
to HALTED"), the PHY device will be put in a low-power mode using
BMCR\_PDOWN if the the interface is set down. The smsc911x driver does
a software\_reset opening the device driver (ndo\_open). In such case,
the PHY must be powered-up before access to any register and before
calling the software\_reset function. Otherwise, as the PHY is powered
down the software reset fails and the interface can not be enabled
again.
This patch fixes this scenario that is easy to reproduce setting down
the network interface and setting up again.

net: sctp: fix memory leak in auth key management

A very minimal and simple user space application allocating an SCTP
socket, setting SCTP\_AUTH\_KEY setsockopt(2) on it and then closing
the socket again will leak the memory containing the authentication
key from user space:

This is bad because of two things, we can bring down a machine from
user space when auth\_enable=1, but also we would leave security sensitive
keying material in memory without clearing it after use. The issue is
that sctp\_auth\_create\_key() already sets the refcount to 1, but after
allocation sctp\_auth\_set\_key() does an additional refcount on it, and
thus leaving it around when we free the socket.

net: sctp: fix NULL pointer dereference in af->from\_addr\_param on malformed packet
[ Upstream commit e40607cbe270a9e8360907cb1e62ddf0736e4864 ]
An SCTP server doing ASCONF will panic on malformed INIT ping-of-death
in the form of:
------------ INIT[PARAM: SET\_PRIMARY\_IP] ------------>
While the INIT chunk parameter verification dissects through many things
in order to detect malformed input, it misses to actually check parameters
inside of parameters. E.g. RFC5061, section 4.2.4 proposes a 'set primary
IP address' parameter in ASCONF, which has as a subparameter an address
parameter.
So an attacker may send a parameter type other than SCTP\_PARAM\_IPV4\_ADDRESS
or SCTP\_PARAM\_IPV6\_ADDRESS, param\_type2af() will subsequently return 0
and thus sctp\_get\_af\_specific() returns NULL, too, which we then happily
dereference unconditionally through af->from\_addr\_param().

net: ppp: Don't call bpf\_prog\_create() in ppp\_lock
[ Upstream commit 5748eb8f8e989a9da1ac7c96dc73d68cbdedf7df ]
In ppp\_ioctl(), bpf\_prog\_create() is called inside ppp\_lock, which
eventually calls vmalloc() and hits BUG\_ON() in vmalloc.c. This patch
works around the problem by moving the allocation outside the lock.
The bug was revealed by the recent change in net/core/filter.c, as it
allocates via vmalloc() instead of kmalloc() now.

vxlan: Do not reuse sockets for a different address family
[ Upstream commit 19ca9fc1445b76b60d34148f7ff837b055f5dcf3 ]
Currently, we only match against local port number in order to reuse
socket. But if this new vxlan wants an IPv6 socket and a IPv4 one bound
to that port, vxlan will reuse an IPv4 socket as IPv6 and a panic will
follow. The following steps reproduce it:
# ip link add vxlan6 type vxlan id 42 group 229.10.10.10 \
srcport 5000 6000 dev eth0
# ip link add vxlan7 type vxlan id 43 group ff0e::110 \
srcport 5000 6000 dev eth0
# ip link set vxlan6 up
# ip link set vxlan7 up

udptunnel: Add SKB\_GSO\_UDP\_TUNNEL during gro\_complete.
[ Upstream commit cfdf1e1ba5bf55e095cf4bcaa9585c4759f239e8 ]
When doing GRO processing for UDP tunnels, we never add
SKB\_GSO\_UDP\_TUNNEL to gso\_type - only the type of the inner protocol
is added (such as SKB\_GSO\_TCPV4). The result is that if the packet is
later resegmented we will do GSO but not treat it as a tunnel. This
results in UDP fragmentation of the outer header instead of (i.e.) TCP
segmentation of the inner header as was originally on the wire.

net: mv643xx\_eth: reclaim TX skbs only when released by the HW
[ Upstream commit 2c2a9cbd64387d6b70ac5db013e9bfe9412c7354 ]
ATM, txq\_reclaim will dequeue and free an skb for each tx desc released
by the hw that has TX\_LAST\_DESC set. However, in case of TSO, each
hw desc embedding the last part of a segment has TX\_LAST\_DESC set,
losing the one-to-one 'last skb frag'/'TX\_LAST\_DESC set' correspondance,
which causes data corruption.
Fix this by checking TX\_ENABLE\_INTERRUPT instead of TX\_LAST\_DESC, and
warn when trying to dequeue from an empty txq (which can be symptomatic
of releasing skbs prematurely).

inet: frags: remove the WARN\_ON from inet\_evict\_bucket
[ Upstream commit d70127e8a942364de8dd140fe73893efda363293 ]
The WARN\_ON in inet\_evict\_bucket can be triggered by a valid case:
inet\_frag\_kill and inet\_evict\_bucket can be running in parallel on the
same queue which means that there has been at least one more ref added
by a previous inet\_frag\_find call, but inet\_frag\_kill can delete the
timer before inet\_evict\_bucket which will cause the WARN\_ON() there to
trigger since we'll have refcnt!=1. Now, this case is valid because the
queue is being "killed" for some reason (removed from the chain list and
its timer deleted) so it will get destroyed in the end by one of the
inet\_frag\_put() calls which reaches 0 i.e. refcnt is still valid.

inet: frags: fix a race between inet\_evict\_bucket and inet\_frag\_kill
[ Upstream commit 65ba1f1ec0eff1c25933468e1d238201c0c2cb29 ]
When the evictor is running it adds some chosen frags to a local list to
be evicted once the chain lock has been released but at the same time
the \*frag\_queue can be running for some of the same queues and it
may call inet\_frag\_kill which will wait on the chain lock and
will then delete the queue from the wrong list since it was added in the
eviction one. The fix is simple - check if the queue has the evict flag
set under the chain lock before deleting it, this is safe because the
evict flag is set only under that lock and having the flag set also means
that the queue has been detached from the chain list, so no need to delete
it again.
An important note to make is that we're safe w.r.t refcnt because
inet\_frag\_kill and inet\_evict\_bucket will sync on the del\_timer operation
where only one of the two can succeed (or if the timer is executing -
none of them), the cases are:
1. inet\_frag\_kill succeeds in del\_timer
- then the timer ref is removed, but inet\_evict\_bucket will not add
this queue to its expire list but will restart eviction in that chain
2. inet\_evict\_bucket succeeds in del\_timer
- then the timer ref is kept until the evictor "expires" the queue, but
inet\_frag\_kill will remove the initial ref and will set
INET\_FRAG\_COMPLETE which will make the frag\_expire fn just to remove
its ref.
In the end all of the queue users will do an inet\_frag\_put and the one
that reaches 0 will free it. The refcount balance should be okay.

arm64: \_\_clear\_user: handle exceptions on strb

```
ARM64 currently doesn't fix up faults on the single-byte (strb) case of
__clear_user... which means that we can cause a nasty kernel panic as an
ordinary user with any multiple PAGE_SIZE+1 read from /dev/zero.
i.e.: dd if=/dev/zero of=foo ibs=1 count=1 (or ibs=65537, etc.)

This is a pretty obscure bug in the general case since we'll only
__do_kernel_fault (since there's no extable entry for pc) if the
mmap_sem is contended. However, with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM enabled, we'll
always fault.

if (!down_read_trylock(&mm->mmap_sem)) {
	if (!user_mode(regs) && !search_exception_tables(regs->pc))
		goto no_context;
retry:
	down_read(&mm->mmap_sem);
} else {
	/*
	 * The above down_read_trylock() might have succeeded in
	 * which
	 * case, we'll have missed the might_sleep() from
	 * down_read().
	 */
	might_sleep();
	if (!user_mode(regs) && !search_exception_tables(regs->pc))
		goto no_context;
}

Fix that by adding an extable entry for the strb instruction, since it
touches user memory, similar to the other stores in __clear_user.

Subject: CVE-2014-7843 Linux kernel: aarch64: copying from /dev/zero causes
 local DoS

It was found that a read of n*PAGE_SIZE+1 from /dev/zero
will cause the kernel to panic due to an unhandled exception since it's
not handling the single byte case with a fixup (anything larger than a
single byte will properly fault.)

A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.
