      "Improper verification of server certificate on SSL/TLS connections."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",

  "additional_information": {
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is caused by the application failing to validate the SSL chain, thus not ensuring that the certificate provided by the site is from a trusted root certificate authority. The issue was identified by the CERT Coordination Center using CERT Tapioca tool.",
