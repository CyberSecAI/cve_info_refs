Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2014-7070**.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Lack of verification of the SSL/TLS chain to ensure the server's certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can be performed by attackers on the same network as the affected Android device.
- Attackers may be able to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device.
- The attacker intercepts and manipulates network traffic between the device and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Must be on the same network as the victim's Android device.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM capability).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is widespread, affecting a large number of Android applications.
- The CERT/CC has performed dynamic testing on over 1 million apps, with over 23,000 found vulnerable.
- A spreadsheet is maintained with details of affected applications, fixes, and other information.
- Workarounds are suggested, such as avoiding untrusted networks and not using affected apps.
- Vendor notifications have been sent to app store operators, such as Amazon, Google.
