- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Exposing an AJAX function to anonymous users using the 'nopriv' method, allowing arbitrary HTML/JavaScript injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript can be executed on the site globally, potentially leading to various malicious activities. Attackers can insert any custom HTML content.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a crafted payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs no authorization and can be remote. They need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.
