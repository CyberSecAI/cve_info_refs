The vulnerability is a use-after-free error in the pdfium library. Specifically, the `m_pLinearized` member was not set to NULL after being released.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted PDF file to the victim's browser.

**Additional Information:**
