{
  "CVE-2014-7822": {
    "Description": "The Linux kernel's splice system call did not correctly validate its parameters. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash).",
    "Root cause": "Lack of size checks in the splice IO path.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient parameter validation",
      "Inadequate size checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system crash) via writing past maximum file size.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user with ability to use the splice system call"
  }
}
