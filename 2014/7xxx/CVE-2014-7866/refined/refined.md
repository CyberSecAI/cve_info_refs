Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7866:

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote code execution via file upload.
*   **Root Cause:** The application allows unauthenticated file uploads to specific servlets, enabling attackers to upload malicious WAR files. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the uploaded file and its destination. Specifically, the `fileName` parameter in the `MigrateLEEData` servlet and `zipFileName` in `MigrateCentralData` servlet are vulnerable because they can be manipulated to write files to arbitrary locations. The use of `%00` (null byte) in the filename likely truncates the filename, allowing writing a WAR file into the webapps directory.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/servlet/MigrateLEEData` or `/servlet/MigrateCentralData` with a crafted `fileName` or `zipFileName` parameter pointing to the web application deployment directory (e.g., `../tomcat/webapps/warfile.war%00`) and including the malicious WAR file payload in the request body.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server by deploying a malicious WAR file.
*   **Affected Versions:**
    *   OpManager v8 build 88XX to 11.4
    *   IT360 10.3/10.4 (requires authentication)
    *   Social IT 11.0 (unauthenticated)
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Unauthenticated access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability in OpManager and Social IT. IT360 requires authentication.
*   **Affected Products:** ManageEngine OpManager, Social IT Plus, and IT360.
*   **Fix:** Apply the provided emergency patch or upgrade to OpManager 11.5 (when released). The emergency patches can be applied to the latest versions of each product (OpManager 11.3/11.4, Social IT 11.0, IT360 10.4).
