# [The ManageOwnage series, part VIII]: Remote code execution and blind SQLi in OpManager, Social IT and IT360

Hi,

This is the 8th part of the ManageOwnage series. For previous parts see [1].

This time we have a file upload leading to remote code execution and a
blind SQL injection in ManageEngine OpManager, Social IT Plus and
IT360.
ManageEngine have released an emergency fix, see details in the
advisory below. The proper fixed version will be 11.5, which will come
out at the end of the year.

I had already released a Metasploit exploit for RCE back in September
[2], which also had an emergency fix and will only be properly fixed
in 11.5, so there is no point in updating the exploit. This is just
another vector that ManageEngine have plugged while we wait for the
release of 11.5. Note that this is all for OpManager. No indication
was given of when Social IT or IT360 will updated with the security
fixes. However the emergency patches be applied to all applications.

Anyway details are below, and I have updated the full text advisory in [3].

Regards,
Pedro
