    "CVE-2014-7206": {
      "description": "The changelog command in Apt before 1.0.9.2 allows local users to write to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the changelog file.",
      "root_cause": "The `apt-get changelog` command creates a temporary directory but then creates the changelog file alongside the temporary directory using the directory name as a prefix, instead of inside the directory. This makes the filename predictable and vulnerable to a symlink attack.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Insecure temporary file handling",
        "Predictable temporary file name",
        "Symlink attack vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files by creating a symlink with the predictable temporary file name before the `apt-get changelog` command creates the file.",
      "attack_vector": "Local symlink attack.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local user with the ability to create symlinks.",
        "details": "The vulnerability is exacerbated by the time it takes apt-get to download the changelog, providing a larger window for the attacker to perform the symlink attack.  The vulnerability was introduced in apt version 0.8.11, and does not affect earlier versions."
