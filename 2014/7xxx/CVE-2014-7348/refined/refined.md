{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper SSL certificate validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
