Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1938)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue and one bug
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way neutron handled the
'dns\_nameservers' parameter. By providing specially crafted
'dns\_nameservers' values, an authenticated user could use this flaw to
crash the neutron service. (CVE-2014-7821)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill, and Michael Xin
(Rackspace) as the original reporters.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The "/var/log/neutron/" directory was world-readable. With this update,

world-read permissions have been removed. (BZ#1149688)

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack 5.0 for RHEL 6 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - RHSA-2014:1938](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1149688)
  - /var/log/neutron/ and all logs within it are world readable.
* [BZ - RHSA-2014:1938](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1163457)
  - CVE-2014-7821 openstack-neutron: DoS via maliciously crafted dns\_nameservers

### Bug Description

The following request body will crash neutron nodes.

{"subnet": {"network\_id": "2aeb163a-a415-4568-bb9e-9c0ac93d54e4", "ip\_version": 4,

"cidr": "192.168.1.3/16",

"dns\_nameservers": ["111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"]}}

Even strace stops logging.

A bit of spelunking shows that the HOSTNAME\_PATTERN expression was introduced to Quantum (now Neutron) during the Grizzly development cycle with change <https://review.openstack.org/14219> and backported to Folsom (in time its first stable point release) with <https://review.openstack.org/16085> in an effort to fix [bug 1062046](/bugs/1062046). It has never been adjusted since, so this vulnerability potentially stretches back to 2012.2.1.

Looks like we probably need a stable/icehouse series task for this bug.

Jeremy,

Also can you add/change that the bug was discovered by Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill and Michael Xin (our security QE team). I was just the one filling the bug and attaching patch from our Neutron developers. Hope it is possible. Thank you for any help.

Neutron core security reviewers need to review the patches attached to this bug and/or propose some new attachments. At the same time the vulnerability management team drafts an impact description, requests a CVE with that and schedules a disclosure date with sufficient time to warn downstream consumers and provide advance copies of the accepted patches. On the disclosure date the patches get pushed into Gerrit, rapidly approved and at the same time an advisory is published detailing the vulnerability. <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management>

It would seem to me to be a good idea to include the CVE and OSSA reference in the commit message, at least for stable/\*.

Thanks

In the past the VMT has merely relied on the closes-bug header in the commit message, but I'll engage the others on the possibility of amending this. Note however that the VMT often is not the source of stable backport uploads, so this would be a requirement the stable branch managers would need to impose on backport change authors. The VMT can document it as a recommended guideline but can't do much to enforce it directly. Also, it could have the potential to further delay landing stable branch security fixes if encumbered with too much additional process beyond that which is strictly necessary to accomplish the intended task.

commit 2794bb89d664355ae1194a0b1f8346c1538caef8

Author: YAMAMOTO Takashi <email address hidden>

Date: Fri Nov 21 14:16:03 2014 +0900

attributes: Additional IP address validation

Introduce an additional IP address validation instead of assuming

    that netaddr provides it. Namely, it ensures that an address

    either has ':' (IPv6) or 3 periods like 'xx.xx.xx.xx'. (IPv4)

The "'1' \* 59" test case recently introduced by

    commit 1681f62ec91b6c3705a14393815542dc1746de71 fails on

    some platforms because it's considered a valid address by

    their inet\_aton. Examples of such platforms: NetBSD, OS X

While one might argue it's a fault of the platforms, this is

    a historical behavior which is probably too late to change there.

(The breakage has been hidden by later UT changes in

    commit 35662d07628452d14306f5197871ad64f6396ff3 .

    This commit includes a UT change to uncover the problem again.)

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0044)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way neutron handled the
'dns\_nameservers' parameter. By providing specially crafted
'dns\_nameservers' values, an authenticated user could use this flaw to
crash the neutron service. (CVE-2014-7821)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill, and Michael Xin
(Rackspace) as the original reporters.

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1149688#c0)  Lee Yarwood    2014-10-06 13:14:57 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  /var/log/neutron/ and all logs within it are world readable. These logs can contain sensitive information and should have access restricted as much as possible.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openstack-neutron-2014.1.2-4.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1149688#c1)  Ihar Hrachyshka    2014-10-07 16:58:13 UTC  ``` Though I agree that we should limit access to log directory as much as possible, the issue is not Neutron specific, and is present in other components (I've checked Nova, Ceilometer; I expect other components to follow the example). So we need to determine how to properly handle that project wide.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1149688#c2)  Lee Yarwood    2014-10-07 20:03:04 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ihar Hrachyshka from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1149688#c1)) > Though I agree that we should limit access to log directory as much as > possible, the issue is not Neutron specific, and is present in other > components (I've checked Nova, Ceilometer; I expect other components to > follow the example). So we need to determine how to properly handle that > project wide.  Agreed, however the customer cited Neutron in the case thus the specific bug. Shall we create an overall tracker to audit the permissions of all openstack service logs and keep this one targeted at Neutron?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1149688#c6)  Ihar Hrachyshka    2014-10-30 16:12:42 UTC  ``` @Perry, I'm all for tracking the issue in all projects though I'm not the one to decide, clone and track all of them.  As for puppet, I think the proper way is to make sure puppet modules do *not* touch any directories and rely on proper packaging. Yes, the clone for puppet-modules will also be needed to track that.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1149688#c11)  Toni Freger    2014-11-16 06:25:25 UTC  ``` Have tested in Rhe7  openstack-neutron-2014.1.3-8.el7ost.noarch  /var/log/neutron directory is chmod 750  drwxr-x---. 2 neutron    neutron    4096 Nov 13 15:27 neutron   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1149688#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-12-02 16:48:53 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1938.html>   ``` |  |

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1942)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way neutron handled the
'dns\_nameservers' parameter. By providing specially crafted
'dns\_nameservers' values, an authenticated user could use this flaw to
crash the neutron service. (CVE-2014-7821)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill, and Michael Xin
(Rackspace) as the original reporters.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the network name and UUID were not sent to N1KV

during the subnet creation process. Consequently, N1KV was unable to
properly associate the network and subnet in its local configuration.
This update addresses this issue by sending the required network name and
UUID during subnet creation, with the result that they are now properly
associated on the N1KV. (BZ#1118508)

* Previously, a rollback did not result in all entries being cleared from

the N1KV-specific database tables, resulting in the presence of stale
entries. This update addresses the issue by performing a proper cleanup of
all N1KV tables. Consequently, stale entries are no longer left in the N1KV
tables. (BZ#1124991)

* Previously, the N1KV OpenStack Networking (neutron) plug-in did not sent

the subtype for overlay networks during the network segment pool creation
process. This update addresses this issue by sending the required details
during the creation process. (BZ#1130336)

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1163470#c0)  Miguel Angel Ajo    2014-11-12 18:46:44 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  If you stop the neutron-dhcp-agent, start a new VM, then start neutron-dhcp-agent, the new config file isn't set with new lease, so, the new VM won't find DHCP unless a new VM is started afterwards.  This regression is introduced by the process monitor patch I backported.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  openstack-neutron-2014.1.3-9.el6ost  openstack-neutron-2014.1.3-8.el7ost  starting at openstack-neutron-2014.1.3-4.el7ost  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. stop neutron-dhcp-agent 2. start a new VM, and wait 10-20 seconds 3. start neutron-dhcp-agent 4. try to reboot, start/stop the VM, no success with DHCP 5. Add a new VM to same network, this one will get DHCP 6. Restart the first VM, it will get DHCP now  Actual results:  VM doesn't get dhcp if it was started on the middle of a restart. because leases aren't updated.  dhcp_agent.log will have something like:  2014-11-12 13:16:54.422 23588 DEBUG neutron.agent.linux.utils [req-b123e47f-d42e-4cce-a989-7845168a7acb None] Unable to access /var/lib/neutron/external/pids/74124f90-5fbf-48f2-b2c9-36dbd109ad7d.pid.dnsmasq get_value_from_file /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/agent/linux/utils.py:162  Expected results:  VM get's dhcp as the dhcp-agent restart may update the leases.

A bit of spelunking shows that the HOSTNAME\_PATTERN expression was introduced to Quantum (now Neutron) during the Grizzly development cycle with change <https://review.openstack.org/14219> and backported to Folsom (in time its first stable point release) with <https://review.openstack.org/16085> in an effort to fix [bug 1062046](/bugs/1062046). It has never been adjusted since, so this vulnerability potentially stretches back to 2012.2.1.

Looks like we probably need a stable/icehouse series task for this bug.

Jeremy,

Also can you add/change that the bug was discovered by Henry Yamauchi, Charles Neill and Michael Xin (our security QE team). I was just the one filling the bug and attaching patch from our Neutron developers. Hope it is possible. Thank you for any help.

Neutron core security reviewers need to review the patches attached to this bug and/or propose some new attachments. At the same time the vulnerability management team drafts an impact description, requests a CVE with that and schedules a disclosure date with sufficient time to warn downstream consumers and provide advance copies of the accepted patches. On the disclosure date the patches get pushed into Gerrit, rapidly approved and at the same time an advisory is published detailing the vulnerability. <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management>

In the past the VMT has merely relied on the closes-bug header in the commit message, but I'll engage the others on the possibility of amending this. Note however that the VMT often is not the source of stable backport uploads, so this would be a requirement the stable branch managers would need to impose on backport change authors. The VMT can document it as a recommended guideline but can't do much to enforce it directly. Also, it could have the potential to further delay landing stable branch security fixes if encumbered with too much additional process beyond that which is strictly necessary to accomplish the intended task.

commit 2794bb89d664355ae1194a0b1f8346c1538caef8

Author: YAMAMOTO Takashi <email address hidden>

Date: Fri Nov 21 14:16:03 2014 +0900

attributes: Additional IP address validation

Introduce an additional IP address validation instead of assuming

    that netaddr provides it. Namely, it ensures that an address

    either has ':' (IPv6) or 3 periods like 'xx.xx.xx.xx'. (IPv4)

The "'1' \* 59" test case recently introduced by

    commit 1681f62ec91b6c3705a14393815542dc1746de71 fails on

    some platforms because it's considered a valid address by

    their inet\_aton. Examples of such platforms: NetBSD, OS X

While one might argue it's a fault of the platforms, this is

    a historical behavior which is probably too late to change there.

(The breakage has been hidden by later UT changes in

    commit 35662d07628452d14306f5197871ad64f6396ff3 .

    This commit includes a UT change to uncover the problem again.)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
