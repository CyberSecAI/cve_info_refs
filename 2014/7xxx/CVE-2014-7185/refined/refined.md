Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an integer overflow in Python's `buffer()` function, which fails to properly validate offset and size arguments. Specifically, if very large (or `sys.maxsize`) values are passed to `buffer()`, it is possible to cause an integer wraparound.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is an integer overflow during the calculation of buffer size.
*  **Out-of-bounds read:** The overflow could lead to an attacker being able to read portions of memory outside the boundaries of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to read sensitive data from process memory.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially crash the application due to the memory corruption resulting from out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered if the attacker can control the offset and size arguments passed to the `buffer()` function.
*   This may be possible via network protocols, or through command line arguments.
*   Specific affected components like the CGIHTTPServer module may provide avenues for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to control the offset and size parameters in Python buffer calls. This means the attacker might need control of inputs processed by Python code.
*   The attacker's position varies based on how the vulnerable Python code is used. In some instances, it could be local and some via remote network connection.

**Specific details from the provided contents:**

*   **Red Hat:**
    *   Red Hat Security Advisory RHSA-2015:1330 and RHSA-2015:1064 specifically mention CVE-2014-7185 as a vulnerability fixed in their python27 and python packages.
    *   The issue is described as an integer overflow that can lead to out-of-bounds reads.
    *   The fix is applied through package updates which include python 2.7.8, addressing the vulnerability directly.
*   **Oracle Linux:**
    *   Oracle Linux Bulletin mentions CVE-2014-7185 as affecting `python27` on versions 6 and 7.
    *   They classify the vulnerability as having a base CVSS score of 4.0 with network attack vector which could lead to partial confidentiality and availability impact.
*   **Gentoo:**
    *   Gentoo lists CVE-2014-7185 as one of multiple vulnerabilities fixed in their Python update GLSA 201503-10.
    *   They classify it as exploitable locally or remotely.
*   **Apple:**
    *   Apple's security content mentions CVE-2014-7185 as part of OS X Yosemite v10.10.5 and Security Update 2015-006, addressed by updating python to 2.7.10.
*   **Python Bug Tracker:**
    *   The Python bug tracker (bugs.python.org) highlights the vulnerability as an integer overflow in the `buffer` type that allows reading memory and shows the related changeset as the fix.
*  **Openwall:**
    *   Openwall lists CVE-2014-7185 as a vulnerability related to a wraparound in the `buffer()` function.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an integer overflow in Python's `buffer()` function that can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads, possibly resulting in information disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is addressed by applying specific patches across a range of systems including Red Hat, Oracle Linux, Gentoo, and Apple products. The fix involves validating inputs passed to `buffer()` to prevent the overflow from happening.
