Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-7280:

**Root Cause:**
- A regression error led to the temporary removal of a security control in the Nessus Web UI. This allowed for the injection of arbitrary script code via a specially crafted host header. The vulnerability occurred in Web UI versions 2.3.3 build #83 and #84 before a fix was implemented in version 2.3.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. The Nessus Web UI failed to properly sanitize the "server" header received from scanned web servers. This allowed an attacker to inject JavaScript code into the database via the server header, which was then executed when a user viewed the corresponding scan report.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Escaping:** The server header input received via the plugin was not sanitized or escaped before being stored in the backend database and displayed to users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a Nessus Web UI user's browser.
- **Potential for Account Compromise/Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the JavaScript code injected, an attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing session cookies, modifying data, or performing administrative actions if the user has the required privileges.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could use this to redirect users to malicious websites, or to inject malicious content into the Nessus interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Server:** An attacker needs to set up a malicious web server that returns a specially crafted host header containing JavaScript code.
- **Nessus Scan:** The victim (Nessus user) would need to scan the malicious web server with the vulnerable version of Nessus.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to set up a web server:** An attacker needs the technical capability to set up and control a web server to serve the malicious header.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Nessus Version:** The attacker needs to know that the target is using a vulnerable version of Nessus (Web UI 2.3.3 Build #83 or #84).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present for a limited time due to a regression error and was quickly addressed by Tenable.
- The advisory notes that this vulnerability was mistakenly introduced on 2014-06-12, discovered and reported the following day, and a fix was released on the same day.
- The provided PoC demonstrates the injection of a simple `alert(1)` script within the `server` header.
