**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The Tenda A32 router's web interface lacks proper CSRF protection. Specifically, the `/goform/SysToolReboot` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to:
1. Be able to convince an authenticated administrator of the Tenda A32 router to visit a malicious page.
2. Know the path to the vulnerable endpoint: `/goform/SysToolReboot`.
3. The user must be logged into the routerâ€™s admin interface in order for the attack to work.
