  "CVE-2014-7656": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "Root cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper verification of server certificate on SSL/TLS connections."
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is due to the failure of applications to validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA. A spreadsheet with a list of vulnerable applications is maintained by CERT/CC."
