  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificate during SSL/TLS handshake."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on a network shared with the Android device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to intercept and modify network traffic."
  },
  "additional_information": {
        "details": "The vulnerability arises from applications not verifying the SSL chain against trusted root certificate authorities. The provided Google Sheets document includes a detailed list of affected applications.",
        "testing_methodology": "The CERT Tapioca tool was used for dynamic testing of SSL certificate validation in Android applications. The methodology is further explained in the CERT/CC blog."
