The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7028.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means they don't verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the authenticity of the server certificate during HTTPS communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, allowing an attacker to intercept, view, or modify network traffic meant to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically Man-in-the-Middle (MITM).
- Attackers positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device. This can include public WiFi networks.
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android application and the server it is communicating with.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is provided with a list of affected applications, their status, and any available fixes.
- The CERT Tapioca tool was used for testing applications for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is described as a failure to implement SSL encryption properly.
- There are also references to the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java regarding proper server certificate verification.
- The document also includes CVSS metrics for the vulnerability, which are: Base Score: 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N), Temporal Score: 7, and Environmental Score: 7.5.
- The vulnerability was publicly reported by multiple researchers.
