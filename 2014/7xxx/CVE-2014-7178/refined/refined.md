Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7178:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation in Tuleap's SVN handler pages. Specifically, the application does not validate the syntax of requests before passing them to the `passthru()` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** The vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary operating system commands on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the input provided to the SVN handler, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting Tuleap.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive files)
    - System compromise (installing malware, creating backdoors)
    - Denial of service (crashing the server)

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the SVN handler pages.
- Specifically, the `root` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to command injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid account on the Tuleap instance that has access to SVN repositories. This indicates that the attack is limited to authenticated users who are authorized to view SVN repositories.
- The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted HTTP requests with malicious commands embedded in the `root` parameter.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is demonstrated with the following HTTP request:
```
GET /svn/viewvc.php/?roottype=svn&root=t11 HTTP/1.1
Host: [IP]
User-Agent: M" && cat /etc/passwd > /usr/share/codendi/src/www/passwd.txt && "ozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64;
rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://[IP]/svn/?group_id=102
Cookie: PHPSESSID=2uqjkd0iupn84gigi4e1tekg95; TULEAP_session_hash=362a9e41d1a93c8f195db4ccc6698ef5
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```

In this example, the attacker injects the command `cat /etc/passwd > /usr/share/codendi/src/www/passwd.txt` into the `root` parameter. This command reads the `/etc/passwd` file and saves it to a publicly accessible location within the Tuleap installation.

**Affected versions:**
- Tuleap version 7.4.99.5 and earlier are vulnerable.

**Fixed version:**
- Tuleap version 7.5 addresses this vulnerability.
