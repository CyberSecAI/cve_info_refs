Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-7829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Action Pack (a component of Ruby on Rails) handles static file requests when static file serving is enabled at runtime. Specifically, a specially crafted request can be used to probe the existence of files outside of the application's root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Existence Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to determine if a file exists on the server's filesystem, even if the file is outside the intended web application's scope.
- **Information Leak:** The vulnerability leaks potentially sensitive information about the server's filesystem structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can discover the presence of files that might contain sensitive data or provide clues about the server's configuration.
- While the vulnerability does not allow the attacker to directly access the file contents, knowing of their existence can lead to further reconnaissance or other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers send crafted requests, likely manipulating file paths to probe for the existence of files outside the web application's root directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Rails application.
- The Rails application must have the `config.serve_static_assets` option set to `true` in its configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2014-7818 but uses slightly different crafted strings.
- The issue affects Rails versions >= 3.0.0 and is fixed in versions 3.2.21, 4.0.12, 4.1.8, and later.
- A workaround is available by setting `config.serve_static_assets = false`. However, upgrading is recommended.
- Patches were released for supported release series (3.2.x, 4.0.x & 4.1.x).
