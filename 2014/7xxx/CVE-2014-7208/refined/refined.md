Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-7208:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper sanitization of strings before passing them as parameters to OS commands within GParted. Specifically, filesystem labels used in mount paths were not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection: GParted executes OS commands using root privileges and is vulnerable to command injection attacks due to the lack of sanitization of user-controlled inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete compromise of the system: Attackers can inject arbitrary OS commands which are then executed with root privileges. This allows attackers to reboot the system or execute other malicious commands, resulting in full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- External storage devices: An attacker could create a malicious filesystem with a specially crafted label and use it to inject commands.
- Automounters: If an automounter uses the filesystem label as part of the mount path, this becomes an avenue for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Physical access (local):  The attacker requires the ability to mount a malicious filesystem.
- A system configured to automount external storage devices based on their labels.
- Basic understanding of how filesystems are mounted in Linux.

**More details than the CVE Description:**
- The provided content gives a complete view of the vulnerability, including a proof of concept using mkfs.ext2 to create a malicious filesystem with a command embedded in the label.
- It details the timeline of the vulnerability disclosure and patch release.
- It includes details on how the vulnerability can be exploited when automounters are used.
- It specifies that GParted versions <= 0.14.1 are affected and that versions >= 0.15.0 or patched versions of 0.14.1 are fixed.
