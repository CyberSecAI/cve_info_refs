Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-7836:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of session key checks in two specific files within the LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) module of Moodle.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The absence of session key validation in `mod/lti/request_tool.php` and `mod/lti/instructor_edit_tool_type.php` allows for CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions within the LTI module by tricking a logged-in user into submitting malicious requests. This could include modifying or deleting LTI tool configurations or potentially other actions depending on the functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that targets the vulnerable files. This request would need to be triggered by a logged-in user on the Moodle platform.
- This is a client-side attack that relies on a user visiting a page or opening a link that contains malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get a logged-in Moodle user to execute a crafted request. This could be achieved through various methods, such as:
    - Embedding the malicious request in a website or email
    - Utilizing social engineering tactics to trick a user into visiting a malicious link.
    - Exploiting an unrelated vulnerability to inject malicious code into a trusted page.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is considered "Serious" in terms of severity/risk.
- The affected Moodle versions range from 2.5 to 2.7.2, as well as earlier unsupported versions.
- Patched versions are 2.8, 2.7.3, 2.6.6 and 2.5.9
- The vulnerability was reported by Petr Skoda and tracked under issue number MDL-47924
