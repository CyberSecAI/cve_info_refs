{
  "Root cause": "The JBoss Application Server (WildFly) JacORB subsystem incorrectly assigned socket-binding-ref sensitivity classification for the security-domain attribute.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Incorrect sensitivity classification",
    "Information disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact": "An authenticated user with a specific role could access sensitive information present in the security-domain attribute.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed via JBoss Application Server (WildFly) JacORB subsystem.",
   "Required attacker capabilities": "An authenticated user with a role that has access to attributes with socket-binding-ref, but not with the security-domain-ref classification."
