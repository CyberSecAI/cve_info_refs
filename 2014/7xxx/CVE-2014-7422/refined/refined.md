The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7422.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means they don't verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
- Attackers on the same network may view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The vulnerability occurs when the application communicates via HTTPS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic.
- Man-in-the-middle position on the same network as the vulnerable device.
