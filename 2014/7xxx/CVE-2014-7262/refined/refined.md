Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The "Omake BBS" component within the i-HTTPD web server has a flaw in how it processes input strings. This flaw leads to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before storing it, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts that can be executed when other users view the stored content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary script execution on the user's web browser: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Omake BBS" that will be executed when other users visit or interact with the affected part of the website. This could lead to a variety of impacts such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, via HTTP requests to the vulnerable "Omake BBS" component.
- Input injection: The attack vector involves injecting malicious script through user inputs within "Omake BBS."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No authentication required: The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to inject malicious code.
- Network accessibility: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional Information**
- The affected product, i-HTTPD, is no longer maintained since June 2011.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yamagata of webappsec.jp to IPA.
- The vulnerability was analyzed by JPCERT/CC on 2014/12/09
- The recommended solution is to stop using the vulnerable i-HTTPD and "Omake BBS".
