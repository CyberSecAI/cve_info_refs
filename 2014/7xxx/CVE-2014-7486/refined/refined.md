Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#582497, which is related to CVE-2014-7486:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks become possible.
- Attackers can potentially view or modify network traffic that should be encrypted by HTTPS.
- Possible credential stealing
- Arbitrary code execution could occur depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be a public WiFi network or any network where the attacker can intercept traffic.
- The attacker needs the capability to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the CERT/CC and other researchers.
- The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
- A spreadsheet has been created to track the affected applications and their patch status.
- The CERT/CC used a tool called "CERT Tapioca" for dynamic testing of SSL certificate validation in Android apps.
- The vulnerability is not specific to one vendor but affects many different applications.
- The document references that the FTC settled charges with Fandango and Credit Karma for failing to secure sensitive data.
- The CVSS score is 7.8 (Base) - 7 (Temporal) - 7.5 (Environmental)
- The issue relates to CWE-295 "Improper Certificate Validation" and CWE-296 "Improper Handling of Certificate Validation Results".

This information provides a detailed understanding of the vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and impacts related to the improper SSL certificate validation in multiple Android applications.
