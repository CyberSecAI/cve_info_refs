{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-7191",
    "details": "The nodejs-qs module has the ability to create sparse arrays during parsing. By specifying a high index in a querystring parameter it is possible to create a large array that will eventually take up all the allocated memory of the running process, resulting in a crash.",
    "affected_components": [
      "nodejs-qs module",
      "IBM SDK for Node.js v1.1.0.7 and previous releases",
      "IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Configuration Editor"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the nodejs-qs module's ability to create sparse arrays during parsing without proper limits on array size or index values.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service by sending specially crafted requests with large array indexes in the query string, leading to excessive memory consumption and a crash of the server process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests with crafted query strings."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable component.",
     "Knowledge of how to craft the malicious query string parameter"
    ],
 "additional_info": "The vulnerability is due to a missing call to a compact function after array creation in the `nodejs-qs` module, allowing for the creation of large sparse arrays that exhaust memory. It was also noted that the issue could be triggered by providing a high index within the query string."
