How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2016:1380 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: nodejs010-node-gyp and nodejs010-nodejs-qs security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2016%3A1380)

## Topic

An update for nodejs010-node-gyp and nodejs010-nodejs-qs is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Node.js is a software development platform for building fast and scalable network applications in the JavaScript programming language.

Security Fix(es):

* The nodejs-qs module has the ability to create sparse arrays during parsing. By specifying a high index in a querystring parameter it is possible to create a large array that will eventually take up all the allocated memory of the running process, resulting in a crash. (CVE-2014-7191)

Bug Fix(es):

* A previous patch to the nodejs010-node-gyp RPM package introduced a bug, which caused the node-gyp module to work incorrectly. As a consequence, users were unable to install or build native Node.js modules. A new patch has been applied, the node-gyp module now works as expected, and it no longer affects other modules. (BZ#1255594)

All nodejs010-nodejs-qs and nodejs010-node-gyp users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata relevant to your system have been applied.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Description

[![@Dshiv](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7023987?u=50cb8abb014857412857e36184aac5cf118fddf2&v=4&size=48)](/Dshiv)[Dshiv](https://github.com/Dshiv)opened [on Apr 22, 2014](https://github.com/tj/node-querystring/issues/104#issue-32012724)

This may be the same as issue [#28](https://github.com/tj/node-querystring/issues/28) but the parser will create a new array if the parameter looks like: foo[0]=bar. Taking that a step farther foo[0][100000000]=bar will create an array with an array of null objects at the first index of the object. Any time the server tries to perform an action on this object the process runs out of memory and crashes.

I'd suggest range checks be performed before the creation of the query string parameter object, or cap the size of the parameter object.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1146054#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-09-24 11:27:36 UTC  ``` The qs module has the ability to create sparse arrays during parsing. By specifying a high index it is possible to create a large array that will eventually take up all the allocated memory of the running process, resulting in a crash.  More information: <https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring/issues/104> CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/640>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1146054#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-09-24 11:28:02 UTC  ```  Created nodejs-qs tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1146055](show_bug.cgi?id=1146055 "CLOSED ERRATA - nodejs-qs: Denial-of-Service Memory Exhaustion [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1146056](show_bug.cgi?id=1146056 "CLOSED ERRATA - nodejs-qs: Denial-of-Service Memory Exhaustion [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1146054#c2)  T.C.

That, by itself, might not be considered a vulnerability report; however, omitting the call to the compact function can probably be considered a security problem.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1255594#c0)  Honza Horak    2015-08-21 04:46:19 UTC  ``` Description of problem: after removing nodejs-gyp, the package is trying to build with v8314-gyp, but since configure.js clears PYTHONPATH, the gyp python module is not found.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): nodejs010-node-gyp-1.0.2-3.el7 nodejs010-node-gyp-1.0.2-3.el6  How reproducible: everytime  Steps to Reproduce: 1. try to rebuild nodejs010-nodejs-bson package  Actual results: gyp info spawn argsTraceback (most recent call last):    '-Goutput_dir=.' ]   File "/opt/rh/v8314/root/usr/bin/gyp", line 15, in <module>     import gyp  Expected results: package builds successfully  Additional info: found during centos rebuild: <https://cbs.centos.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=24459>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1255594#c1)  andrew.sharpe.7.9    2015-09-19 06:00:17 UTC  ``` Working around the path issue by commenting the line that overwrites PYTHONPATH in configure.js reveals further issues, such as  gyp: error: no such option: --no-parallel   One workaround is to install a newer version of node-gyp using npm, so it seems we're needing an update to the packaged node-gyp to alleviate this issue.  The PYTHONPATH workaround is not required with the newer node-gyp.  The version of node-gyp I have from RPMs (via software collections) is nodejs010-node-gyp-1.0.2-3.el6.noarch.  The version installed by npm is 3.0.3   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1255594#c3)  ashahugian    2015-12-16 15:52:26 UTC  ``` I am hitting the same issue with nodejs010-2.1-3.el6.x86_64 and nodejs010-node-gyp-1.0.2-3.el6.noarch.  The original node-gyp comes with bundled gyp inside it; which is expected to be located in node-gyp/gyp/pylib and the config.js file overrides the PYTHONPATH. When the RPM provided gyp wrapper is called it takes no measures to readjust the PYTHONPATH and the RPM provided node-gyp doesn't have gyp/pylib directory at all; resulting in errors.  The simplest workaround that I have found is to edit /opt/rh/v8314/root/usr/bin/gyp and add line right after the import sys:  sys.path.append("/opt/rh/v8314/root/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages")  The above path is where the RPM supplied gyp is located which completely fixes the issue.  Without this fix npm install for any packages that have addons is effectively broken.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1255594#c5)  Joe Orton    2016-06-14 09:53:45 UTC  ``` Proposing for 2.2-Z update along with [bug 1344158](show_bug.cgi?id=1344158)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1255594#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2016-07-05 06:25:36 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
