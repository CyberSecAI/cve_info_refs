- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the failure to properly sanitize user-supplied pointers before they are dereferenced within the handling of calls to `IOHIDSecurePromptClient`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input sanitization of user-supplied pointers before dereferencing them.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to crash an instance of OS X, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker through a malicious page or file that the target must interact with. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to lure a user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
