The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7767.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they don't verify if the certificate provided by the site was issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain of trust.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential stealing and arbitrary code execution, depending on the applicationâ€™s functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept and modify HTTPS traffic.
- Untrusted networks, such as public WiFi, increase the likelihood of a successful MITM attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM capability).
