The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7491.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate was issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to check the validity of the SSL chain, leaving applications vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing.
- Potential arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic.
