The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7054.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. They do not verify that the certificate presented by the server is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically a failure to verify the server certificate against a trusted root CA. This allows for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept and potentially modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. The specific impact can vary based on the application, but may lead to:
*   Credential stealing
*   Arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could include public WiFi or other untrusted networks.

**Additional details:**

*   The CERT/CC blog provides details on the dynamic testing methodology used to identify vulnerable applications via the CERT Tapioca tool.
*   The vulnerability is widespread and affects a large number of applications.
*   A spreadsheet is provided to track affected applications, fixes, and other related information.
*   The vulnerability is related to the broader issue of insecure SSL/TLS implementations in mobile apps, which was also the subject of Federal Trade Commission settlements with vendors like Fandango and Credit Karma in March 2014.
*   The vulnerability note also mentions the concept of “Android apps that fail to validate SSL certificates” was reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC, along with additional reporters of this issue.
