{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to two weaknesses in the Google Play system apk's OAuth implementation. First, arbitrary URL parameters could be injected into the HTTP request, allowing modification of request behavior such as setting 'has_permission=1' without user consent. Second, undocumented scopes \"SID\" and \"LSID\" could be requested, returning session cookies in clear.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "URL parameter injection vulnerability via the `_opt_XXX` parameter in the `getToken` Bundle extras argument.",
    "Exposure of sensitive session cookies (SID and LSID) through undocumented scopes."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An installed app with no permissions could gain full access to the device owner's Google account. This could allow an attacker to leak sensitive OAuth2 scopes and potentially take over the Google account.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious Android app can exploit the vulnerability by binding to the `com.google.android.gms/.auth.GetToken` service and injecting specific parameters/scopes in the request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to create and install a malicious app on the victim's Android device. The app itself requires no special permissions."
