Package        : getmail4
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-7273 CVE-2014-7274 CVE-2014-7275
Debian Bug     : 766670

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in getmail4, a mail
retriever with support for POP3, IMAP4 and SDPS, that could allow
man-in-the-middle attacks.

CVE-2014-7273

    The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.43.0
    does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain
    sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

CVE-2014-7274

    The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify
    that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's
    Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain
    sensitive information via a crafted certificate from a recognized
    Certification Authority.

CVE-2014-7275

    The POP3-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.44.0
    does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof POP3 servers and obtain
    sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.46.0-1~deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.46.0-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.46.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your getmail4 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
