The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7047.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify that the certificate provided by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically the lack of proper verification of the server's certificate chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible, allowing an attacker on the same network as the Android device to intercept and modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
*   This can lead to various impacts depending on the application, including credential theft (e.g., usernames, passwords) or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*   Attackers need to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be positioned on the same network as the targeted Android device. This could be a public Wi-Fi network or any network under the attacker's control.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the Android device and the server it is communicating with.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is widespread, affecting numerous Android applications.
*   The CERT/CC performed dynamic testing using a tool called "CERT Tapioca" to identify vulnerable applications.
*   A spreadsheet is maintained with details about affected applications, fixes, and related information.
*   The issue is also related to previous FTC settlements with companies for similar SSL implementation failures.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by avoiding untrusted networks and ensuring applications properly validate SSL certificates.
*   The provided CVSS metrics give a base score of 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N), which signifies high impact.
