Vulnerability: Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

Root Cause: The applications do not properly validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

Impact: An attacker on the same network can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS, potentially leading to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.

Attack Vector: A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.

Attacker Capabilities: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
