The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7104.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means that they do not verify if the certificate provided by a server was issued by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Improper SSL certificate validation

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This could allow the attacker to view or modify network traffic, potentially leading to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks, specifically man-in-the-middle attacks on a network shared with the vulnerable Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This could be an untrusted network such as public WiFi.
