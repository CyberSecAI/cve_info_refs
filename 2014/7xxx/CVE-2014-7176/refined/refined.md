Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7176:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **blind SQL injection** present in the Enalean Tuleap application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `global_txt` parameter in the `/plugins/docman/` URL. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database through user-controlled input.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The SQL injection is "blind," meaning that the attacker does not receive direct output from their queries. Exploitation relies on observing application behavior to infer information from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful attack could allow an attacker to access sensitive information stored in the database, including usernames and password hashes. This can lead to complete compromise of user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the `/plugins/docman/` URN to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Tuleap system to access the vulnerable `/plugins/docman/` resource.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tuleap server.

**Additional Information:**
*   The specific vulnerable parameter is `global_txt` in a GET request to the `/plugins/docman/` URL.
*   The affected versions are Tuleap 7.4.99.5 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Tuleap version 7.5.
