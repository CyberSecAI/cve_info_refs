CVE-2014-7427:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. They do not properly validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper SSL certificate validation.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker on the same network may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS, potentially leading to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.
  - Attack vectors: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to perform a MITM attack.
