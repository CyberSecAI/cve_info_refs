The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7726.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This occurs when applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL/TLS server certificate

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can be performed.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Arbitrary code execution (in some cases depending on the application functionality).

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Public or untrusted Wi-Fi networks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is available with a list of affected applications (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing).
- The issue was discovered using a tool called CERT Tapioca.
- The problem of improper SSL validation in mobile apps was highlighted in an FTC settlement with Fandango and Credit Karma.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-295 and CWE-296.
