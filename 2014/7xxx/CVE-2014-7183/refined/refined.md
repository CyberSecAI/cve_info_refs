Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7183:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the LiteCart application's search functionality. Specifically, the `query` parameter in the `search.php` script does not properly neutralize special characters, particularly those used to construct HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application reflects user-provided data directly into the HTML output without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed within the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page.
- This allows the attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Modify the content of the web page.
    - Conduct phishing attacks.
    - Potentially perform other actions within the context of the victim's browser and session on the vulnerable web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the `query` parameter of the `search.php` script.
- Specifically, crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code are used as input to the vulnerable parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs that include malicious JavaScript code.
- No special privileges or positions are needed other than being able to send an HTTP request to the target web server.
- The attacker can distribute the malicious URL via email, social media, or any other method.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a victim clicks on the malicious link or visits a page containing the malicious link, causing the injected code to run in their browser.

**Technical Details:**
The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) URLs demonstrate how to exploit this vulnerability:
```
http://example.com/litecart-1-1-2-1/search.php?query='"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(0x0000C0)</scRipt>
```
```
http://example.com/litecart-1-1-2-1/search.php?'"--></style></scRipt><scRipt>alert(0x0000B9)</scRipt>
```
These URLs inject malicious script tags that execute a simple `alert()` function within the user's browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Netsparker (now Invicti) and reported as NS-14-032.
- The vulnerability was found in LiteCart version 1.1.2.1 and potentially earlier versions.
- A fix for this vulnerability was included in LiteCart version 1.2 as stated in the provided text.
- The issue was fixed by the vendor within a few days of being notified (23/09/2014 – First Contact, 29/09/2014 – Vendor released fix).
- The reference from Henri Salo points out the vulnerability was also present in the search functionality of LiteCart 1.3.2
