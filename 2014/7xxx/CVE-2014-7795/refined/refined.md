The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7795.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means that the applications do not verify the SSL certificate chain to ensure the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation: Applications do not verify the SSL chain, which can lead to accepting untrusted certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker on the same network can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential theft: Attackers can potentially steal user credentials transmitted over compromised HTTPS connections.
- Arbitrary code execution: Depending on the application, this vulnerability could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device to intercept and modify traffic.
- MITM attack: Attackers perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting and potentially modifying the traffic between the vulnerable app and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Interception capabilities: The attacker must be able to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was identified and reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC, along with other researchers.
- The CERT/CC blog provides details about the methodology used to test applications with CERT Tapioca, a tool used to identify the vulnerability.
- The document references a spreadsheet that lists affected applications and the availability of fixes.
- The provided content mentions that over 23,000 apps out of 1 million tested were vulnerable.
