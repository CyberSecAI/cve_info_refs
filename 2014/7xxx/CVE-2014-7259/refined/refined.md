**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information management issue within the "Kaku-San-Sei Million Arthur" Android application. Specifically, the application stores credentials on the SD card without sufficient protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure storage of credentials on the SD card.
- Lack of proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.

- The malicious application would then be able to read and exfiltrate the credentials stored by the vulnerable "Kaku-San-Sei Million Arthur" application.
- The user needs to be tricked into installing this malicious application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to develop and distribute Android applications.
- Ability to trick users into installing their malicious app.
- No specific network access is required, but the attacker's malicious application must be installed on the same device as the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-255 (Credentials Management) which indicates an issue with storing and handling credentials.
- The CVSS v2 score for this vulnerability is 2.6, which is considered low. This is largely because of the high access complexity, where the user needs to install a malicious application.
