In that case, calling umount on \"/\" will return -EINVAL with or without this patch. Outside a userns, this patch will have no effect. may_mount, required by umount, already checks ns_capable(current->nsproxy->mnt_ns->user_ns, CAP_SYS_ADMIN) so an additional capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN) check will have no effect. That leaves anything that calls umount on \"/\" in a non-root userns while chrooted.
