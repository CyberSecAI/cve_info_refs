It seems unlikely that there's an alternate perspective in which it's
not an upstream vulnerability. Untrusted .js input seems to be a
common use case, and the impact is an infinite loop (or similar).

Use CVE-2014-7204.

## Binary packages built by this source

[exuberant-ctags](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/exuberant-ctags):
build tag file indexes of source code definitions

ctags parses source code and produces a sort of index mapping

 the names of significant entities (e.g. functions, classes,

 variables) to the location where that entity is defined. This

 index is used by editors like vi and emacsen to allow moving to

 the definition of a user-specified entity.

 .

 Exuberant Ctags supports all possible C language constructions

 and multiple other languages such as assembler, AWK, ASP, BETA,

 Bourne/Korn/Z shell, C++, COBOL, Eiffel, Fortran, Java, Lisp,

 Lua, Makefile, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, REXX, Ruby, S-Lang,

 Scheme, Tcl, Verilog, Vim and YACC.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14277#c0)  David Walser    2014-10-13 20:14:03 CEST  ``` Fedora has issued an advisory on October 1: <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2014-October/140349.html>  Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 3, Mageia 4, and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated ctags package fixes security vulnerability:  A denial of service issue was discovered in ctags 5.8. A remote attacker could cause excessive CPU usage and disk space consumption via a crafted JavaScript file by triggering an infinite loop (CVE-2014-7204).

Not familiar with this package but managed to create a TAGS index file in my ruby directory by running "ctags -eR *" and then searched the file from within emacs.  exuberant-ctags is an application designed to compile an index of various program constructs found in a specified set of files.  There is support for a variety of languages including C, C++, Python and Ruby and programming tools such as emacs understand the format.  It proves its worth in large software projects with a complex file hierarchy.

Package        : exuberant-ctags
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-7204

Stefano Zacchiroli discovered a vulnerability in exuberant-ctags, a tool
to build tag file indexes of source code definitions: Certain JavaScript
files cause ctags to enter an infinite loop until it runs out of disk
space, resulting in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-4+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-8.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your exuberant-ctags packages.

Package: exuberant-ctags
Version: 1:5.9~svn20110310-7
Severity: important

<http://sources.debian.net> run ctags on Debian source packages. When, a few days
ago, it hit chromium-browser/33.0.1750.152, it was up to a bad surprise. Ctags
run as follows:

  ctags --recurse --excmd=number --fields=+lnz --sort=no --links=no -o FILE

not only seems to enter an infinite loop (similar to #190717), but does so in a
way that can quickly exhaust disk space (differently from #190717, AFAICT).

I've tracked down the culprit to glge-compiled-min.js (attached, 200 Kb). It
seems that on it ctags end up generating an infinite symbol name whose pattern
looks like this (yes, on a single very long line):

   augment.augment.ParticleSystem...augment.augment.ParticleSystem..augment.augment.ParticleSystem........augment.augment.ParticleSystem..augment.augment.ParticleSystem...augment.augment.ParticleSystem..augment.augment.ParticleSystem....augment.augment.ParticleSystem..augment.augment.ParticleSystem...augment.augment.ParticleSystem..augment.augment.ParticleSystem.....augment.augment

Running ctags on it alone suffices to trigger the bomb. FWIW (and for different
reasons) I've tried various combinations of flags that make ctags use, or not,
tempfiles, and it doesn't affect the outcome. It's either the tempfile or
directly the final output file built incrementally that explodes.

As it is pretty nasty for sources.d.n, forcing me to implement a bare bone
package blacklist, I'm also open to workaround suggestions :)

With many thanks for maintaining ctags!
Cheers.

I had a brief look at this, but not enough to find the exact source of
the issue. I think the issue may start in writeCtagsEntry(), resulting
in lots of new_do_write() calls.

FWIW, I tried your reproducer on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, ctags
5.6-1.1, and it was not affected. Fedora was affected, which uses ctags
5.8-10.

Cheers,

Sorry for taking so long to look at this.  I finally got round to
checking upstream and noticed that it doesn't happen with trunk, so I
bisected and found that this change fixes the bug:

  <http://sourceforge.net/p/ctags/code/791/>

This applies cleanly to the snapshot we currently have, so I'll apply it
to unstable.  I'll put together a wheezy-security update too.

Cheers,

Hi team@security.d.o,

I'd like to issue security updates for #742605, as above.  As far as I
can tell this does not yet have a CVE identifier assigned.  Please could
you assign one?

Thanks,

That's awesome, Colin, thanks a lot!  One of the blockers to migrating
sources.d.n to sources.d.o just went away, thank to you.

I'm looking forward to the security upload,
Cheers.

Right, I requested that one.

team@security, is the attached patch (and .dsc and .debian.tar.gz) fine
with you?  I wouldn't ordinarily leave a commented-out function in place
in my own code, but I thought it best to stick to backporting a single
upstream commit where possible rather than tidying it up further.

If this is OK then I can upload, and also make a similar change to
squeeze-lts.

Thanks,

Yes, please upload. Note that exuberant-ctags is new in wheezy-security, so it needs
to be built with "-sa".

I'll take care of the update.

Cheers,
