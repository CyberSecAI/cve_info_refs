Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-7536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means the applications do not verify if the server's certificate is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper SSL certificate validation in the affected applications. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended security of HTTPS connections.
*   The applications do not verify the SSL/TLS chain to ensure the certificate presented by the server is legitimate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a MITM attack.
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS, leading to the exposure of sensitive data transmitted by the application.
*   **Credential Theft:** The attacker can potentially steal user credentials.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based, requiring the attacker to be on the same network as the victim's Android device.
*   **MITM:** The attacker intercepts communications between the application and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device, or in a position to intercept network traffic between the device and the server.
*   **MITM Capabilities:** The attacker must be capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack. This can be achieved on untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi or by compromising network infrastructure.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Applications:** A large number of Android applications were affected by this vulnerability. A spreadsheet with a list of affected applications and their status is provided, although the spreadsheet's content was not directly available in the provided data.
*   **Testing Methodology:** The CERT Tapioca tool was used to test applications for this vulnerability.
*   **Vendor Notifications:**  Application store operators (Amazon, Google) and some app vendors were notified of the vulnerability.
