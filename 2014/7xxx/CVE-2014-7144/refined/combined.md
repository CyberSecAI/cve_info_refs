The same comments about the option set in the paste.ini for [bug 1354269](/bugs/1354269) and this being managed by the oslo.config object apply here.

This, if oslo.config is used as a fix, is a duplicate of [bug 1354269](/bugs/1354269)

The scenario where a deployer specifically sets:

ssl\_insecure = false

... in an attempt to ensure that verification is performed will be sorely disappointed to learn that it is not, and perhaps left vulnerable. This qualifies as a security fix and \*should\* be fixed in python-keystoneclient as well as keystonemiddleware.

After reading the code & proposed patch, I'm not sure that the assertion made by this bug is correct: "In auth\_token.py, \_http\_request(), self.ssl\_insecure is a string" (it's defined using oslo to be a bool). Can someone confirm that this is an issue?

Also, my example config in comment #4 should not have used "ssl\_insecure." The correct configuration option is actually:

insecure = false

I have done the tests and can confirm this is an issue. If I add 'insecure = 1' in /etc/nova/nova.conf it is OK, the 'insecure' can be convert to bool. But, if I add 'insecure = 1' in /etc/nova/api-paste.ini the 'insecure' would be a string. This is because when add conf in /etc/nova/api-paste.ini the conf will be passed into AuthProtocol class as initialization parameters rather than passed into oslo.

So.. how we consider this this depends a bit how common it is to pass such parameters in api-paste.conf instead of nova.conf. Are both options fully supported ? Was one deprecated in favor of the other ?

Thierry - config options for auth\_token can be put in either api-paste.ini or .conf. Both are fully supported. I think the plan was to deprecate api-paste.ini options but that never happened.

Draft impact description:

Title: TLS certificate verification option not honoured in paste configurations

Reporter: Qin Zhao (IBM)

Products: keystonemiddleware, python-keystoneclient

Versions: versions up to 1.1.1 (keystonemiddleware), versions up to 0.9.0 (python-keystoneclient)

Description:

Qin Zhao from IBM reported a vulnerability in python-keystoneclient and keystonemiddleware. When the 'insecure' option is set in a paste configuration file it is effectively ignored, regardless of its value. As a result certificate verification will be disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. All versions of keystonemiddleware and python-keystoneclient configured via a paste.ini file are affected by this flaw.

Impact description in #12 looks good to me.

Maybe a note that ssl configuration in .conf is not impacted if no ssl configuration is done in paste file.

Maybe "certificate" -> "cert" and "configurations" -> "configs" in the title for shorter title line ?

Maybe mention that the vulnerability is in keystonemiddleware, which was in the past shipped as part of python-keystoneclient (that may make it clearer what they need to update)

convert the conf value into correct type

If options are set in paste file e.g. api-paste.ini for nova, all

    the option values passed into AuthProtocol.conf are string type.

    So, we should convert the conf value into correct type.

The same comments about the option set in the paste.ini for [bug 1354269](/bugs/1354269) and this being managed by the oslo.config object apply here.

This, if oslo.config is used as a fix, is a duplicate of [bug 1354269](/bugs/1354269)

The scenario where a deployer specifically sets:

ssl\_insecure = false

... in an attempt to ensure that verification is performed will be sorely disappointed to learn that it is not, and perhaps left vulnerable. This qualifies as a security fix and \*should\* be fixed in python-keystoneclient as well as keystonemiddleware.

After reading the code & proposed patch, I'm not sure that the assertion made by this bug is correct: "In auth\_token.py, \_http\_request(), self.ssl\_insecure is a string" (it's defined using oslo to be a bool). Can someone confirm that this is an issue?

Also, my example config in comment #4 should not have used "ssl\_insecure." The correct configuration option is actually:

insecure = false

I have done the tests and can confirm this is an issue. If I add 'insecure = 1' in /etc/nova/nova.conf it is OK, the 'insecure' can be convert to bool. But, if I add 'insecure = 1' in /etc/nova/api-paste.ini the 'insecure' would be a string. This is because when add conf in /etc/nova/api-paste.ini the conf will be passed into AuthProtocol class as initialization parameters rather than passed into oslo.

So.. how we consider this this depends a bit how common it is to pass such parameters in api-paste.conf instead of nova.conf. Are both options fully supported ? Was one deprecated in favor of the other ?

Thierry - config options for auth\_token can be put in either api-paste.ini or .conf. Both are fully supported. I think the plan was to deprecate api-paste.ini options but that never happened.

Draft impact description:

Title: TLS certificate verification option not honoured in paste configurations

Reporter: Qin Zhao (IBM)

Products: keystonemiddleware, python-keystoneclient

Versions: versions up to 1.1.1 (keystonemiddleware), versions up to 0.9.0 (python-keystoneclient)

Description:

Qin Zhao from IBM reported a vulnerability in python-keystoneclient and keystonemiddleware. When the 'insecure' option is set in a paste configuration file it is effectively ignored, regardless of its value. As a result certificate verification will be disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. All versions of keystonemiddleware and python-keystoneclient configured via a paste.ini file are affected by this flaw.

Impact description in #12 looks good to me.

Maybe a note that ssl configuration in .conf is not impacted if no ssl configuration is done in paste file.

Maybe "certificate" -> "cert" and "configurations" -> "configs" in the title for shorter title line ?

Maybe mention that the vulnerability is in keystonemiddleware, which was in the past shipped as part of python-keystoneclient (that may make it clearer what they need to update)

convert the conf value into correct type

If options are set in paste file e.g. api-paste.ini for nova, all

    the option values passed into AuthProtocol.conf are string type.

    So, we should convert the conf value into correct type.

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-keystoneclient security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1784)

## Topic

Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue and two
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command line utility for
interacting with the OpenStack Identity API.

It was found that Python-keystoneclient treated all settings in paste.ini
files as string types. If the "insecure" option were set to any value in a
paste.ini configuration file, it would be evaluated as true, resulting in
TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
(CVE-2014-7144)

Note that when the "insecure" option was not set in paste.ini, it evaluated
to false, and verification was performed.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, when running Python-keystoneclient in the DEBUG log level,

sensitive data may have been logged in plain text. Refer to the OSSN-0024
document, linked to in the References, for further information.
(BZ#1106328)

* Previously, when attempting to enable the use of the s3\_token middleware,

for use with the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) APIs, a "No
module named webob" error was returned. (BZ#1133431)

All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Details

Qin Zhao discovered Keystone disabled certification verification when

the "insecure" option is set in a paste configuration (paste.ini)

file regardless of the value, which allows remote attackers to conduct

machine-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted certificate. ([CVE-2014-7144](/security/CVE-2014-7144))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c0)  Eduard Barrera    2014-08-25 06:58:35 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Hi,  I'm attempting to enable the S3 APIs in Swift with authentication via Keystone. According to this page from the Grizzly docs:  <http://docs.openstack.org/grizzly/openstack-compute/admin/content/configuring-swift-with-s3-emulation-to-use-keystone.html>  the s3token middleware is needed to enable Keystone authentication. However after adding s3token to the pipeline I get this error in swift-startup.log:  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "/usr/bin/swift-proxy-server", line 23, in <module>     sys.exit(run_wsgi(conf_file, 'proxy-server', default_port=8080, **options))   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/swift/common/wsgi.py", line 257, in run_wsgi     loadapp(conf_path, global_conf={'log_name': log_name})   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/swift/common/wsgi.py", line 107, in wrapper     return f(conf_uri, *args, **kwargs)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 247, in loadapp     return loadobj(APP, uri, name=name, **kw)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 271, in loadobj     global_conf=global_conf)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 296, in loadcontext     global_conf=global_conf)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 320, in _loadconfig     return loader.get_context(object_type, name, global_conf)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/swift/common/wsgi.py", line 55, in get_context     object_type, name=name, global_conf=global_conf)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 450, in get_context     global_additions=global_additions)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 562, in _pipeline_app_context     for name in pipeline[:-1]]   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/swift/common/wsgi.py", line 55, in get_context     object_type, name=name, global_conf=global_conf)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 458, in get_context     section)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 517, in _context_from_explicit     value = import_string(found_expr)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/PasteDeploy-1.5.0-py2.6.egg/paste/deploy/loadwsgi.py", line 22, in import_string     return pkg_resources.EntryPoint.parse("x=" + s).load(False)   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/pkg_resources.py", line 1948, in load     entry = __import__(self.module_name, globals(),globals(), ['__name__'])   File "/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/keystoneclient/middleware/s3_token.py", line 35, in <module>     import webob ImportError: No module named webob  I found that we have the package python-webob1.2 installed on the Swift proxy servers (exact version: 1.2.3-2.2.el6ost), but obviously it's not being found. After further investigation, I found this bugzilla:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=971026](show_bug.cgi?id=971026 "CLOSED ERRATA - Dependancy issue prevents swift proxy from starting")  Which seems to indicate that this exact issue was corrected in python-keystoneclient-0.2.3-4.el6ost a year ago. However we still seem to be experiencing this issue despite having a newer version (python-keystoneclient-0.7.1-2.el6ost) installed.   I've also found that installing the package python-webob (version: 0.9.6.1-3.el6) gets round this issue and allows Swift to start with the s3token middleware in the pipeline. However as this appears to be a recurrence of a known and previously fixed bug I thought I'd ask for help.  So I have 2 questions:  1. Is the s3token middleware still required for S3 API authentication via Keystone please? 2. Is there a way to get the s3token middleware working with python-webob1.2?      Actual results:   Expected results:   Additional info:   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c2)  Alan Pevec    2014-08-26 13:46:55 UTC  ``` Which is NVR of openstack-swift RPM?   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c3)  Pete Zaitcev    2014-08-27 04:06:12 UTC  ``` To answer Eduard's questions:  1. Yes, s3_token is required.  2. One could make the s3_token working with python-webob1.2 by applying a corrective patch in the field, taken from [bug 971026](show_bug.cgi?id=971026 "CLOSED ERRATA - Dependancy issue prevents swift proxy from starting"). Of course you have to re-apply this by hand every time there's an update.  Most likely, we'll make sure that the same patch is applied again in order to fix this bug (I'll talk it over with Alan).  That, however, is still undesirable, I think. The reason is, the middleware creates a webob.Request, then feeds it down into the rest of Swift. But Swift switched to swob, which may not be perfectly compatible. When it operates on a request, Swift core considers it a swob.Request.  I need to come up with a solution like this:  <https://review.openstack.org/32825> Unfortunately, fixing s3_token is trickier, since it uses a full Request.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c5)  Alan Pevec    2014-08-27 09:56:45 UTC  ``` > 2.

Note: that would apply to rhos4 only, in rhos5 we dropped parallel versions and updated webob to python-webob-1.2.3-8.el6ost   > That, however, is still undesirable, I think.

Seems that swob.Request is compatible enough with python-webob-0.9.6.1-3.el6   for duck-typing to work so we could just add dep on python-webob as a workaround until proper fix is done upstream.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c6)  Alan Pevec    2014-08-27 10:17:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 931374](attachment.cgi?id=931374&action=diff "proposed patch for RHOS4") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=931374&action=edit "proposed patch for RHOS4") proposed patch for RHOS4   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c7)  Alan Pevec    2014-08-27 10:37:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 931388](attachment.cgi?id=931388&action=diff "proposed patch for RHOS4") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=931388&action=edit "proposed patch for RHOS4") proposed patch for RHOS4  <= Icehouse keystoneclient includes s3_token only (ec2_token was moved, along with s3_token m/w to keystonemiddleware project in Juno)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c8)  Alan Pevec    2014-08-27 10:38:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 931389](attachment.cgi?id=931389&action=diff "proposed patch for RHOS5") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=931389&action=edit "proposed patch for RHOS5") proposed patch for RHOS5   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c9)  Pete Zaitcev    2014-08-27 14:15:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Alan Pevec from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1133431#c7)) > Created [attachment 931388](attachment.cgi?id=931388&action=diff "proposed patch for RHOS4") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=931388&action=edit "proposed patch for RHOS4") > proposed patch for RHOS4  Even better than the add-dist magic.

# RHSA-2015:0020 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-keystoneclient security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0020)

## Topic

Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command line utility for
interacting with the OpenStack Identity API. The OpenStack Identity
auth\_token middleware component handles the authentication of tokens
with keystone.

It was found that python-keystoneclient treated all settings in paste.ini
files as string types. If the "insecure" option were set to any value in a
paste.ini configuration file, it would be evaluated as true, resulting in
TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
(CVE-2014-7144)

Note that when the "insecure" option was not set in paste.ini, it evaluated
to false, and verification was performed.

All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, all
OpenStack services using auth\_token must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Subject: [OSSA 2014-030] TLS cert verification option not honoured in paste
 configs (CVE-2014-7144)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-030
CVE: CVE-2014-7144
Date: September 25, 2014

Title: TLS cert verification option not honoured in paste configs
Reporter: Qin Zhao (IBM)
Products: keystonemiddleware, python-keystoneclient
Versions: versions up to 1.1.1 (keystonemiddleware),
          versions up to 0.10.1 (python-keystoneclient)

Description:
Qin Zhao from IBM reported a vulnerability in keystonemiddleware
(formerly shipped as python-keystoneclient). When the 'insecure' option
is set in a paste configuration file it is effectively ignored,
regardless of its value. As a result certificate verification will be
disabled, leaving TLS connections open to MITM attacks. All versions of
keystonemiddleware with TLS settings configured via a paste.ini file are
affected by this flaw.

keystonemiddleware fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/113191>

python-keystoneclient fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/112232>

Notes:
These fixes are included in the keystonemiddleware 1.2.0 release
and in the python-keystoneclient 0.11.0 release.

# RHSA-2014:1783 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-keystoneclient security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1783)

## Topic

Updated python-keystoneclient packages that fix one security issue and one
bug are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

Python-keystoneclient is a client library and a command line utility for
interacting with the OpenStack Identity API.

It was found that Python-keystoneclient treated all settings in paste.ini
files as string types. If the "insecure" option were set to any value in a
paste.ini configuration file, it would be evaluated as true, resulting in
TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
(CVE-2014-7144)

Note that when the "insecure" option was not set in paste.ini, it evaluated
to false, and verification was performed.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, when attempting to enable the use of the s3\_token middleware,

for use with the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) APIs, a "No
module named webob" error was returned. (BZ#1141933)

All python-keystoneclient users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.
