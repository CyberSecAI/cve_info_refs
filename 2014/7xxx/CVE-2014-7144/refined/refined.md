  "CVE-2014-7144": {
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in how the `python-keystoneclient` and `keystonemiddleware` handle the 'insecure' option when set in a paste configuration file (e.g., api-paste.ini). Specifically, the code incorrectly interprets the value of the `insecure` option. If this option is present, regardless of whether its value is set to 'true' or 'false', the code treats it as true and disables TLS certificate verification. This behavior leaves TLS connections vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "affected_components": [
      "keystonemiddleware",
      "python-keystoneclient"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The root cause is an incorrect conditional expression in the code that handles the 'insecure' option from paste configuration files.  The code checks for the mere existence of the configuration option instead of evaluating the boolean value associated with the key. Because configuration values from paste.ini files are treated as strings, any non-empty string is considered `True` in the conditional expression, thus disabling certificate verification regardless of the intended value.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect handling of boolean configuration values.",
      "Failure to properly validate TLS certificates.",
        "Improper type conversion from string to boolean"
    ],
    "impact": "By disabling TLS certificate verification, the vulnerability opens TLS connections to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could intercept and modify communication between the client and the server, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on TLS connections"
    ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server, such as being on the same network or having compromised a router or intermediate device.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is specific to scenarios where the 'insecure' option is set in a paste configuration file (.ini), and not when it is set in .conf files where the values are properly parsed by oslo library as booleans."
