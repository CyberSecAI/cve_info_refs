Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#582497 which relates to CVE-2014-7049:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** Applications do not correctly verify the SSL certificate chain, leaving them vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Lack of Trust:** The applications don't ensure that the server they connect to is who they claim to be due to the lack of proper certificate validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can intercept, view, and modify network traffic that should be encrypted by HTTPS.
- **Credential Stealing:** Attackers may be able to steal sensitive information like usernames and passwords.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable devices.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially alter data exchanged between the application and the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The primary attack vector is network-based, specifically an attacker on the same network (e.g., public WiFi) as the vulnerable Android device.
- **MITM Attack:** The attacker performs a MITM attack, intercepting communications between the application and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim.
- **MITM Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack to intercept and potentially modify network traffic. This may involve tools to spoof DNS or other methods to redirect traffic.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was discovered through dynamic testing using a tool called CERT Tapioca.
- A spreadsheet tracks affected applications, their status, and any available fixes.
- The issue was widespread, affecting many Android apps and libraries.
- The vulnerability was found to be related to the fact that companies failed to properly implement SSL encryption.
