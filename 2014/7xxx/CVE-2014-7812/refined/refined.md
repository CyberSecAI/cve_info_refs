Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2014-7812 is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present within the "System Groups" field in Red Hat Satellite and Spacewalk. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The vulnerability is of the stored XSS type. This means that malicious script injected into the system is stored on the server (in the System Groups field). When other users access this data, the malicious script is executed within their browsers.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The core issue is that the application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided input (specifically, XML data through the REST API) before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the context of a victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:**  By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal a victim's session cookies, allowing for session hijacking and unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can potentially be used to steal data.
*   **Phishing and Defacement:** An attacker can leverage XSS to deface web pages, redirect users to malicious sites, and craft convincing phishing attacks.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In certain circumstances, an attacker could potentially use XSS as part of a larger chain of exploits that can lead to privilege escalation within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **REST API:** The attack vector involves using the REST API to submit XML data containing malicious scripts within the "System Groups" field.
*   **Web Interface:** The injected code is executed when an authorized user accesses the affected areas of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to interact with the REST API.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to reach the REST API endpoint of the Red Hat Satellite/Spacewalk server.
*   **Knowledge of the API:** The attacker must be aware of the specific REST API endpoint and the structure of the XML data required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was discovered and reported by MickaÃ«l Gallier, as acknowledged by Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in Red Hat Satellite Server v 5.7 via RHSA-2015:0033.
*   SUSE also addressed the vulnerability in SUSE Manager 1.7 and 2.1.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 score of 3.5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N) indicating a moderate severity.

The provided data indicates that multiple XSS vulnerabilities were found (CVE-2014-7811), with CVE-2014-7812 being one of them specifically related to the system group field. This confirms that other fields are also affected by similar issues.
