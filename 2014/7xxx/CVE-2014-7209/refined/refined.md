Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7209:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `run-mailcap` utility, which is part of the `mime-support` package, is vulnerable to shell command injection. This is due to insufficient sanitization of filenames passed to the utility when executing commands based on entries in the mailcap file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Shell command injection:** The primary vulnerability is that filenames containing shell meta-characters (e.g., backticks, `$` , semicolons) are not properly sanitized before being used in commands executed by `run-mailcap`. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By crafting a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Direct calls to `run-mailcap`:** Some software packages, particularly email clients, might directly call `run-mailcap` to handle certain file types, creating a direct attack vector.
*   **Indirect calls via `xdg-open`:** The widely used `xdg-open` utility can also call `run-mailcap`. In specific scenarios, particularly when the victim isn't using a popular desktop environment, this indirect call can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious file downloads:** An attacker can use malicious filenames in file downloads (e.g., through Google Chrome/Chromium) to trigger the vulnerability via `xdg-open`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to provide a malicious filename:** An attacker needs to be able to trick the victim's system into processing a file with a malicious name. This can be achieved through various means such as:
    *   Email attachments
    *   File downloads
    *   Other mechanisms that pass filenames to `run-mailcap` or `xdg-open`
*   **User interaction:** The victim must take some action to open the malicious file (or trigger a program to open it).

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically triggered when `run-mailcap` executes a command based on a mailcap entry, and the filename argument contains shell meta-characters.
*   The provided patches address the vulnerability by:
    *   Sanitizing the filename argument to prevent command injection
    *   Ensuring absolute paths are used for filenames.
*   The vulnerability primarily affects Debian-based Linux distributions, though other systems with `mime-support` installed might also be vulnerable.
