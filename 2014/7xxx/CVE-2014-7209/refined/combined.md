Debian Security Advisory DSA-3114-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : mime-support
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-7209

Timothy D. Morgan discovered that run-mailcap, an utility to execute
programs via entries in the mailcap file, is prone to shell command
injection via shell meta-characters in filenames. In specific scenarios
this flaw could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.52-1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Subject: Command Injection in mime-support/run-mailcap (CVE-2014-7209)

Hello,

I discovered a shell injection vulnerability in the run-mailcap script of the
mime-support package.  This vulnerability is exploitable in a variety of very
specific scenarios when an attacker can convince a victim to open a file with a
malicious file name using the run-mailcap script.  Only a handful of software
packages (such as email clients) are likely to call run-mailcap directly, but it can
also be called by xdg-open, which is much more widely used.  However, in the xdg-open
case, the victim must not be using one of the popular desktop environments in order
for the issue to be triggered.  In the xdg-open case, it was possible to execute
arbitrary code using Google Chrome/Chromium file downloads as a vector.  (Yes, this
is a separate issue from the xdg-open shell injection vulnerability that was reported
not long ago.)

It seems that mime-support is primarily used by Debian-based Linux distributions,
though FreeBSD does have a port for it.  I'm not sure what other distros may make it
available.  Debian has released a security update (DSA-3114-1) for the issue.  I am
also attaching patches which correct the flaw in the previous version.

Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso and Charles Plessy for developing the patches.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
