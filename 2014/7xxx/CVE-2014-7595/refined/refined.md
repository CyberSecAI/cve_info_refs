{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates in SSL/TLS connections."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is due to the failure of Android applications to validate the SSL chain to ensure that the certificate is issued by a trusted root CA. This issue is tracked under VU#582497 by CERT. A spreadsheet with affected applications is maintained. The document also mentions that in March 2014, the Federal Trade Commission settled charges with two vendors (Fandango and Credit Karma) for similar issues, highlighting the widespread nature of the problem."
