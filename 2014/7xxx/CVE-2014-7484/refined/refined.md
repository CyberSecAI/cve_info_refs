The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7484.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate provided by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, applications do not validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted CA.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, positioned on the same network as the Android device, can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This can lead to the attacker viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. The specific impact varies depending on the application but includes the potential for credential theft and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, achievable by an attacker positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim. This could be a public Wi-Fi network or any network where the attacker can intercept and manipulate network traffic.
