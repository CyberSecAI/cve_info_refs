Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an **OS command injection flaw** present in multiple FUJITSU Android devices. This occurs when the device fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input before passing it to the operating system for command execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core issue is that the affected devices allow an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands through a vulnerable interface. This is due to insufficient input validation and sanitization.
*   **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') (CWE-77)** is a parent weakness of CWE-78
*   **Argument Injection (CWE-88):** In some cases, the vulnerability might also include argument injection, where the attacker can manipulate command-line arguments passed to the OS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
*   **Root Privileges:** The attacker can gain root privileges on the device.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** This can lead to total loss of system protection, allowing for full compromise of the device.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** Exploitation can lead to total information disclosure, complete compromise of system integrity, and a total shutdown of the affected resource.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access to the device, requiring either physical access or a local shell account.
*   **Malicious Applications:** A malicious app could exploit the vulnerability after being installed.
*   **Input Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by providing malicious input, specially crafted commands or arguments, through a vulnerable application or interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some form of local access to the device, either physical or through a shell account.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker must be able to provide malicious input in the correct format to be processed by the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Devices:** The vulnerability affects multiple FUJITSU Android devices. Specific models are listed by NTT DOCOMO, INC, including:
    *   F-12C
    *   ARROWS Tab LTE F-01D
    *   ARROWS Kiss F-03D
    *   REGZA Phone T-01D
*   **Vendor Response:** Software updates were made available for all the affected devices in 2012. Users are advised to apply the latest software updates.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 6.2, indicating a medium severity.
*   **Reported by:** Masaaki Chida of GREE, Inc. reported this vulnerability to IPA.
