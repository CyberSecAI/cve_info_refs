### Bug Description

Relates to findings while fixing [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1343604](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/%2Bbug/1343604)

mask\_password() needs to be more robust and catch many more common formats of strings that could include passwords.

An example is that it does not catch something like '--password=top-secret' but does catch '--password="top-secret"'. See below; the logged messages are being generated by using mask\_password().

/usr/sbin/mysqld --password=top-secret

2014-07-19 18:35:01.415 20588 ERROR openstack.common.processutils [-] Running cmd (subprocess): /usr/sbin/mysqld --password=secret

They did catch

/usr/sbin/mysqld --password="top-secret"

2014-07-19 18:35:48.686 20605 ERROR openstack.common.processutils [-] Running cmd (subprocess): /usr/sbin/mysqld --password="\*\*\*"

We are going to take care of the OSSA task within the former report:

Can we mark this bug as a duplicate of 1343604 ?

Oh forget about the duplicate idea, this is another issue. We may cover both within a single OSSA though.

@Amrith, while those two bugs where under private review here in LP you may have wait for a disclosure time before pushing fix to gerrit.

Now that the former referenced bug report is public, and as it contains all the details of this strutils.mask\_password bug, I think it's better to open this report as well.

Yes, this bug should be marked public-security rather than private-security, since the vulnerability was already explicitly mentioned publicly in [bug 1343604](/bugs/1343604).

Tristan, Doug,

I've pushed a partial fix for this bug. I would like to fix it more thoroughly but in the interest of time, and of getting something into Juno, I've pushed a partial.

Thanks,

Make strutils.mask\_password more secure

Make some enhancements to strutils.mask\_password to allow it to catch

    more cases of passwords in strings. Test cases have been added to test

    for these newly added situations.

The following is a listing of patterns that will be handled. The

    keyword that mask\_password uses (a list of four now) is represented by

    <key> and the password is shown as <password>. Quotes (both single and

    double) are represented as <quote>.

--<key> <password>

    --<key> <quote><password><quote>

    <key> = <password>

    <key> = <quote><password><quote>

All existing tests and patterns are still handled.

I've manually marked this as "Fix Released" because the change appears to have made it to all the paces where we need it (for now). The changes had been submitted with "Partial Fix" and therefore LP didn't do this automatically (I'm guessing).

There are (at least) two CVE IDs needed because of the different
vulnerability types. The older code in which processutils.execute was
simply logging cmd directly, without any masking step, can be
considered an instance of the
<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html> issue. For this, use
CVE-2014-7230.

The older code with a short _FORMAT_PATTERNS list, with a later
replacement by longer _FORMAT_PATTERNS_1 and _FORMAT_PATTERNS_2 lists,
can be considered an instance of the
<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/184.html> issue. Bug #1343604
mentions 'mask_password did not, for example, catch the usage ...
/usr/sbin/mysqld --password=top-secret ... They did catch ...
/usr/sbin/mysqld --password="top-secret" ... make the strings in
strutils.mask_password more robust.' For this, use CVE-2014-7231.

The additional complication is that there were apparently already
releases with incomplete fixes for CVE-2014-7230. Separate CVE IDs are
needed when parts of the problem were fixed in different releases. For
example, Cinder 2013.2.4 contains a fix for the "Running cmd
(subprocess)" logging problem but apparently does not contain a fix
for the "Running cmd (SSH)" logging problem. The patch for the latter
is shown in the
<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/trove/commit/?id=9672744f090d462cac5eb757ceaacd7122362708>
commit. Is this a remaining vulnerability in Cinder 2013.2.4 and
possibly other products? If so, then we will assign another CVE ID.

## Topic

Updated openstack-trove packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Database (trove) is Database as a Service for Openstack. It runs
entirely on OpenStack, with the goal of allowing users to quickly and
easily utilize the features of a database without the burden of handling
complex administrative tasks. Cloud users and database administrators can
provision and manage multiple database instances as needed.

It was found that the processutils.execute() and strutils.mask\_password()
functions did not correctly sanitize the authentication details from their
output before storing them in log files. This could allow an attacker with
read access to these log files to obtain sensitive information such as
passwords. (CVE-2014-7230, CVE-2014-7231)

The openstack-trove packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149745)

All openstack-trove users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.
