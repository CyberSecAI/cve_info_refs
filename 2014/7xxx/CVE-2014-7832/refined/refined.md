Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-7832:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient access checks within the LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) module.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The LTI module's capability checks only verified access to the course and not the specific activity within the course.
- Specifically, the `mod/lti/launch.php` file lacked proper access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to LTI activities by users who should not have access, potentially allowing them to view or interact with content they are not supposed to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves directly accessing the `mod/lti/launch.php` script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user within the Moodle platform and have some form of access to the course containing the vulnerable LTI activity, but not necessarily authorized access to the specific LTI activity.

**Versions Affected:**
- Moodle versions 2.7 to 2.7.2, 2.6 to 2.6.5, 2.5 to 2.5.8, and earlier unsupported versions are vulnerable.

**Versions Fixed:**
- This issue was fixed in Moodle versions 2.8, 2.7.3, 2.6.6, and 2.5.9.
