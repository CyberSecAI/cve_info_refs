The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7746.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This occurs because the applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically not verifying the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.
- Failure to implement proper server certificate verification on SSL/TLS connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, allowing an attacker on the same network to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic, typically by being on the same network as the victim's Android device (e.g., on the same public Wi-Fi).
- The attacker needs to be able to perform a MITM attack to intercept and modify the HTTPS communication.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
*   The CERT/CC blog describes the methodology used to test applications with CERT Tapioca for this vulnerability.
*   The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) settled charges with two vendors for similar SSL encryption failures, highlighting the real-world implications.
*   A spreadsheet is maintained with details about the affected applications and the availability of fixes, which is continuously updated.
*   The provided CVSS metrics are as follows: Base: 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N), Temporal: 7 (E:F/RL:W/RC:C), Environmental: 7.5 (CDP:ND/TD:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:ND)
