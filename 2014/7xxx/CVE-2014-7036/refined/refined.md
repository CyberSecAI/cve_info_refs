  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of SSL certificate chains."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the Android device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. No user interaction is required beyond the app using the network."
