Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw present in JBoss Undertow when running on Microsoft Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation when handling resource URIs, specifically when they contain "dot dot" prefixes ("../"). This allows attackers to bypass intended directory access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that are accessible to the user running the Java process. This leads to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data, configuration files, or other confidential resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests where the requested resource URI is manipulated to include directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- No specific authentication or prior access is required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can be remote.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the paths of the files they want to read.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Windows platform.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Undertow versions 1.0.17.Final, 1.2.0.Beta3, and 1.1.0.CR5.
- The vulnerability is tracked as UNDERTOW-338 in the JBoss issue tracker.
