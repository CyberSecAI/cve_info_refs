Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the iLogScanner software's flawed processing of analysis results. When a specially crafted access log file is analyzed, the software fails to properly sanitize the data before outputting the results into an HTML page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) is present due to improper handling of user-controlled input (the access log file content) when generating the output HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary scripts into the HTML output. This allows the attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser when viewing the analysis results. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Phishing attacks
    - Defacement of the viewed page
    - Unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through a crafted access log file.
    - An attacker needs to create a malicious access log file with embedded script tags or other methods of injecting JavaScript.
    - The attacker would then need to have the user (target) analyze the malicious log using the vulnerable iLogScanner application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious access log file.
    - The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, they simply need the victim to open the crafted log file in the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects iLogScanner V4.0.
- The online version of iLogScanner has already been updated to fix this issue.
- Users of the offline version of iLogScanner should update to the latest version.
- The vulnerability was reported by Shinya Mizutani of NTT NEOMEIT CORPORATION and Kazuhiko Kusano to IPA.
