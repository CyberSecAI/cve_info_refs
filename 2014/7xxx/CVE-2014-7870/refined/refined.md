- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Drupal Custom Search module fails to sanitize filter labels before display.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript, to attack site users, potentially leading to account compromise, web server compromise, or client-side malware attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the "Label text" input field in the Custom Search module configuration, an attacker can inject malicious code that is then executed when a user views the search results.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the "administer custom search" permission to modify the module settings.
