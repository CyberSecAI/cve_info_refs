The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7380.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically failing to check if the certificate is from a trusted CA. This corresponds to CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation and CWE-296: Improper Handling of Certificate Validation.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This allows the attacker to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. The impact varies depending on the application but can include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This is often achieved through public Wi-Fi networks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target Android device and have the ability to intercept network traffic (MITM).
