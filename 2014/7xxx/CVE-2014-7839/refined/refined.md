  "CVE-2014-7839": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CVELink": "https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2014-7839.html",
      "Description": "The RESTEasy DocumentProvider did not set the external-parameter-entities and external-general-entities features appropriately, thus allowing external entity expansion. A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The RESTEasy DocumentProvider does not disable external entity processing by default.",
       "Weaknesses": [
        "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, and potentially execute arbitrary code through further advanced XXE attacks.",
      "Attack Vector": "By sending specially crafted XML requests to a RESTEasy endpoint.",
      "Attacker Capabilities": "A remote attacker capable of sending XML requests."
    },
    "Affected Products": [
       "Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.1.0",
        "Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.1.0",
        "Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 6.4.1",
        "Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.1.0",
        "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.3.3"
    ],
   "Fix Information":{
        "Fix": "The issue is addressed by ensuring that the RESTEasy DocumentProvider disables external parameter and general entities by default.",
        "Resolution": "Upgrade to the patched versions of the affected Red Hat JBoss products."
