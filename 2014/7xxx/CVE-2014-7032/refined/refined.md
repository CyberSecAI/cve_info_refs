  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper SSL certificate validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack via a compromised network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is due to applications not verifying the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority. A large number of Android applications are affected. CERT/CC used CERT Tapioca to identify vulnerable applications. The provided spreadsheet contains information about affected applications and available fixes, and it was updated frequently."
