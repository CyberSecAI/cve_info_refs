Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they don't verify if the certificate presented by the server is from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL/TLS chain of trust.
- Lack of proper implementation of SSL encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Ability for attackers on the same network to view or modify network traffic meant to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential theft and arbitrary code execution.
- Exposure of sensitive information transmitted by the applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, specifically MITM attacks.
- Exploitation through compromised or untrusted networks, including public Wi-Fi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided spreadsheet ([Android App SSL Failures](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing)) contains a list of affected applications and information about fixes.
- The vulnerability was discovered through dynamic testing methodology using a tool named CERT Tapioca.
- This issue has been publicly known since at least October 2012, but was made more broadly known in 2014.
- The vulnerability relates to the issues highlighted in the FTC settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma.
- CERT/CC has notified vendors operating Android application stores to promote better testing of application before inclusion into their stores.
