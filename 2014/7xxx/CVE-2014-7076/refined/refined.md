  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper verification of server certificates on SSL/TLS connections.",
        "Failure to validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker on the same network may perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the Android device.",
        "Exploiting lack of proper SSL certificate validation in vulnerable applications."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to intercept and modify the network traffic."
