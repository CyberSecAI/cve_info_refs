How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Updated icu packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 31 Jan 2015

Modification date: 31 Jan 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-7923](CVE-2014-7923.html)
,
[CVE-2014-7926](CVE-2014-7926.html)
,
[CVE-2014-7940](CVE-2014-7940.html)

## Description

```
Updated icu packages fix security vulnerabilities:

The Regular Expressions package in International Components for Unicode (ICU)
52 before SVN revision 292944 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
vectors related to a zero-length quantifier or look-behind expression
(CVE-2014-7923, CVE-2014-7926).

The collator implementation in i18n/ucol.cpp in International Components for
Unicode (ICU) 52 through SVN revision 293126 does not initialize memory for a
data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted character sequence
(CVE-2014-7940).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c0)  David Walser    2015-01-27 20:37:15 CET  ``` The latest Google Chrome update fixed multiple issues in ICU: <http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2015/01/stable-update.html>  Our package uses the system icu, so these still need to be fixed there.  Christiaan located patches in the Chromium source for these, and said the first two also apply to ICU 53 in Cauldron.  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  David Walser    2015-01-27 20:37:26 CET   Whiteboard: (none) => MGA4TOO  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c1)  David Walser    2015-01-27 21:47:35 CET  ``` Cauldron is still pending investigation.  Christiaan has uploaded a patched package for Mageia 4: icu-52.1-2.1.mga4 icu-data-52.1-2.1.mga4 icu-doc-52.1-2.1.mga4 libicu52-52.1-2.1.mga4 libicu-devel-52.1-2.1.mga4  from icu-52.1-2.1.mga4.src.rpm ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c2)  David Walser    2015-01-27 22:16:10 CET  ``` The RedHat bug for CVE-2014-7940 says the affected code was completely rewritten in ICU 53, which confirms what Christiaan told me earlier.  The RedHat bugs for CVE-2014-7923 and CVE-2014-7926 identify upstream commits, which I have rediffed for 53.1 and applied in Cauldron. <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1185202> <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1185205> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c3)  David Walser    2015-01-27 22:23:06 CET  ``` Thanks Christiaan for your help with this!  Advisory: ========================  Updated icu packages fix security vulnerabilities:  The Regular Expressions package in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 52 before SVN revision 292944 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to a zero-length quantifier or look-behind expression (CVE-2014-7923, CVE-2014-7926).  The collator implementation in i18n/ucol.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 52 through SVN revision 293126 does not initialize memory for a data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted character sequence (CVE-2014-7940).

Looking at Insert > Special Character in LibreOffice Writer, it looks to me like things are fine with this update.  Firefox in Mageia 4 isn't built against system icu.  This should probably be corrected.  It was fixed in Cauldron in r655459. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c5)  David Walser    2015-01-28 13:46:46 CET  ``` As pointed out on oss-security, the upstream patches I added in from the links from the RedHat bugs for the two CVEs only corresponded to the "regex.patch" from Chromium, but the "regex2.patch" corresponds to an additional upstream commit: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/01/28/12>  I've now added the additional commit in Cauldron's icu.  A CVE has been requested for this change in the message above.  I'll update the advisory when it has been assigned. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c6)  Herman Viaene    2015-01-28 14:56:55 CET  ``` MGA4-64 on HP Probook 6555b. No installation issues.

It does not.  No, strace only catches system calls. ltrace is meant for tracing library calls but it never seems to work properly when I try to use it. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c8)  David Walser    2015-01-28 15:05:10 CET  ``` I'm guessing you forgot to use the -f option to strace to follow child processes.  The libreoffice commands run a series of scripts before they run the real executable.  Alternatively, you can run "oowriter --strace" as the libreoffice scripts have the option, and it will run it through strace for you, and save it in the current directory as "strace.log"  You should see libicuuc.so.52 being loaded. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c9)  claire robinson    2015-01-28 16:46:26 CET  ``` Testing complete mga4 32  Used thunderbird.  $ strace -o strace.out thunderbird  $ grep icu strace.out open("/lib/libicui18n.so.52", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4 open("/lib/libicuuc.so.52", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4 open("/lib/libicudata.so.52", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 4 ..etc  Everything displays normally. ```  ---   Whiteboard: (none) => has\_procedure mga4-32-ok  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c10)  claire robinson    2015-01-28 18:16:21 CET  ``` Advisory uploaded. ```  ---   Whiteboard: has\_procedure mga4-32-ok => has\_procedure advisory mga4-32-ok  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=15145#c11)  claire robinson    2015-01-28 18:45:10 CET  ``` Testing complete mga4 64  Validating.

CVE-2014-9654 has been assigned: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/02/05/15>  I don't have a description for this one yet, but it sounds like a stack overflow.

## Details

Several memory corruption bugs were discovered in ICU. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2014-7923](/security/CVE-2014-7923), [CVE-2014-7926](/security/CVE-2014-7926))

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation. If a user

were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. ([CVE-2014-7924](/security/CVE-2014-7924))

A use-after free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in Blink.

If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an

attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7925](/security/CVE-2014-7925))

Several memory corruption bugs were discovered in V8. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2014-7927](/security/CVE-2014-7927), [CVE-2014-7928](/security/CVE-2014-7928), [CVE-2014-7931](/security/CVE-2014-7931))

Several use-after free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in

Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service

via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7929](/security/CVE-2014-7929), [CVE-2014-7930](/security/CVE-2014-7930), [CVE-2014-7932](/security/CVE-2014-7932),

[CVE-2014-7934](/security/CVE-2014-7934))

A use-after free was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary

code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7933](/security/CVE-2014-7933))

Multiple off-by-one errors were discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash

or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render

process. ([CVE-2014-7937](/security/CVE-2014-7937))

A memory corruption bug was discovered in the fonts implementation. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer

crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed

render process. ([CVE-2014-7938](/security/CVE-2014-7938))

It was discovered that ICU did not initialize memory for a data structure

correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted

website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges

of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7940](/security/CVE-2014-7940))

It was discovered that the fonts implementation did not initialize memory

for a data structure correctly. If a user were tricked in to opening a

specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code

with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7942](/security/CVE-2014-7942))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2014-7943](/security/CVE-2014-7943))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to

opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit

this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2014-7946](/security/CVE-2014-7946))

It was discovered that the AppCache proceeded with caching for SSL

sessions even if there is a certificate error. A remote attacker could

potentially exploit this by conducting a MITM attack to modify HTML

application content. ([CVE-2014-7948](/security/CVE-2014-7948))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial

of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1205](/security/CVE-2015-1205))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked

in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially

exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via

renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1346](/security/CVE-2015-1346))

# oxide-qt 1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
oxide-qt (1.4.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1) trusty-security; urgency=medium

  * Update to v1.4.2 (see USN-2476-1)
    - Bump Chromium rev to 40.0.2214.91
    - Fix LP: [#1297973](/bugs/1297973) - Don't allow the BrowserContext to be deleted until
      the render thread is quit in single process mode
    - Fix LP: [#1321969](/bugs/1321969) - Add proper API for handling page closing:
      + Add WebView.prepareToClose() which runs the current page's
        beforeunload handler
      + Add WebView.prepareToCloseResponse signal, which tells the embedder
        whether a close should proceed
      + Add WebView.closeRequested signal, driven from window.close()
      + Ensure the current page's unload handler runs when a WebView is deleted
    - Fix LP: [#1353143](/bugs/1353143) - Add an API for saving and restoring the state of a
      WebView, used for session restore in the browser
    - Fix LP: [#1374494](/bugs/1374494) - Warnings when processing GPU blacklist
    - Fix LP: [#1283291](/bugs/1283291) - Cannot use multiple BrowserContexts in single-process
      mode. Make WebView.context read-only in single-process mode (all
      WebViews will use a default WebContext)
    - Fix LP: [#1326115](/bugs/1326115) - Disable WebView.incognito in single-process mode. It
      relies on using multiple BrowserContexts, which is not possible in
      single process
    - Fix LP: [#1249147](/bugs/1249147) - Use TCMalloc in the renderer process
    - Fix LP: [#1389777](/bugs/1389777) - More natural scrolling - tweak the gesture fling curve
    - Fix LP: [#1398941](/bugs/1398941) - Tidy up the LoadEvent sequence for failed loads
    - Fix LP: [#1381558](/bugs/1381558) - Fix crash in
      oxide::CompositorThreadProxy::SendSwapSoftwareFrameOnOwnerThread
    - Fix LP: [#1402382](/bugs/1402382) - Fix a potential memory leak because of a refcount race
    - Fix LP: [#1398087](/bugs/1398087) - Fix application crash when accessing
      navigator.webkitPersistentStorage.requestQuota
    - Really fix LP: [#1391230](/bugs/1391230) - Release the screen dim lock when the
      application becomes inactive
    - Turn pinch virtual viewport on for mobile form factors
    - Limit the maximum decoded image size on mobile
    - Remove the screen-dim lock when the application goes in to the background
      (and restore it when it comes back in to the foreground)
    - Don't create OTR BrowserContexts unnecessarily
    - Add an experimental API for changing the process model
      (Oxide.processModel)
    - Don't leak WebPreferences if the WebView is deleted without ever
      accessing WebView.preferences
    - Add support for component builds
  * Refresh gross-hack-for-dual-ffmpeg-build.patch

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
