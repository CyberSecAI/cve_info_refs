                 CVE-2014-7188

Multiple security issues have been discovered in the Xen virtualisation
solution which may result in denial of service, information disclosure
or privilege escalation.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

              Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-7188 / XSA-108
                              version 4

              Improper MSR range used for x2APIC emulation

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Public release.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The MSR range specified for APIC use in the x2APIC access model spans
256 MSRs. Hypervisor code emulating read and write accesses to these
MSRs erroneously covered 1024 MSRs. While the write emulation path is
written such that accesses to the extra MSRs would not have any bad
effect (they end up being no-ops), the read path would (attempt to)
access memory beyond the single page set up for APIC emulation.

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious HVM guest can crash the host or read data
relating to other guests or the hypervisor itself.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 4.1 and onward are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered Jan Beulich at SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2013-10-03 08:06:37 UTC  ``` public now, via oss-sec               Xen Security Advisory CVE-2013-4344 / XSA-65                               version 2                   qemu SCSI REPORT LUNS buffer overflow  UPDATES IN VERSION 2 ====================  Public release.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================  qemu contains a possible buffer overflow in the SCSI code that implements the REPORT LUNS command.  The buffer can be overflowed by creating a SCSI controller with more than 256 attached devices (such as disks) and sending a REPORT LUNS command with a short transfer buffer (less than 2056 bytes).  Xen systems do not use the qemu SCSI code by default.  IMPACT ======  On Xen systems where the device_model_args (or equivalent) parameters have been used to configure a SCSI controller for a guest, with more than 256 devices, a malicious guest might be able to escalate its privilege to that of the qemu process in the host (typically root).  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Only Xen systems whose administrators have deliberately configured HVM guests to have emulated SCSI controllers, and where those guests are provided with more than 256 devices, are vulnerable.  We are not aware of any such systems.  MITIGATION AND RESOLUTION =========================  Please refer to the advisories and information from the Qemu project.  If, during the embargo period, you have any questions about this advisory in the context of Xen, please contact the Xen Project Security Team.  CREDITS =======  This issue was reported to us by the Qemu project. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c3)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2014-01-24 17:00:20 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (842006) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/215063> 13.1+12.3 / qemu+qemu-linux-user ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c4)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-04-01 13:47:54 UTC  ``` @Charles  This is really a narrow-band scenario. Is it even applicable for any SLE Xen version? If not I would suggest to close this bug. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c5)  Charles Arnold   2014-04-01 22:11:24 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c4)) > @Charles >  > This is really a narrow-band scenario. Is it even applicable for any SLE Xen > version? If not I would suggest to close this bug.  All SLE versions prior to SLE12 use the legacy qemu for HVM guests. SLE11 SP3 allows the use of the newer qemu with HVM guests but it is considered 'technical preview' and is not the default. SLE12 Xen has the fix in its version of qemu.  It is applicable to the Xen version on os13.1 which uses qemu 1.3.1 for both HVM and PV guests. I have taken the patch for os13.1 and SLE11 SP3 (even though it is not the default) just for completeness. I'm ok with closing it. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c6)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-04-02 06:40:42 UTC  ``` Closing as discussed. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-05-08 13:53:51 UTC  ``` Update released for: kvm, kvm-debuginfo, kvm-debugsource Products: SLE-DESKTOP 11-SP3 (i386, x86_64) SLE-SERVER 11-SP3 (i386, s390x, x86_64) ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=842006#c13)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-05-08 17:04:45 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2014:0623-1: An update that fixes 9 vulnerabilities is now available.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Can you provide the domain config file?  With your config, I assume reproducing is as simple as 'xl create config.file; sleep; xl list dom-name'?  > What version of xen-tools are you running?  Currently the system has xen-tools-4.3.0_03-248.1.x86_64 from the Virtualization project in OBS.  But I also tried with the latest xen-tools package from the updates (<http://download.opensuse.org/update/12.3/x86_64/xen-tools-4.2.1_12-1.8.1.x86_64.rpm>) ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c5)  Ralph Schaffner   2013-06-12 15:12:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 543896](attachment.cgi?id=543896 "Xen xm formatted config file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=543896&action=edit "Xen xm formatted config file") Xen xm formatted config file  Actually I use virsh for starting my VMs and the long list option doesn't work with any of them.  After upgrading my homevhst to os12.3, I took my xm formatted config files and converted them to libvirt formatted xml using "virsh domxml-from-native". I then used "virsh define" to add them to libvirt.  I can do most things through virsh and libvirt but some things are not yet supported (ex. "virsh console" does not work) which means I need to use xl.  I would assume that xl is pulling the information from xenstore and not from a config file so I would assume it doesn't matter but maybe I'm wrong.  I've attached the original xm formatted config file. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c6)  Ralph Schaffner   2013-06-12 15:16:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 543898](attachment.cgi?id=543898 "Libvirt formatted config file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=543898&action=edit "Libvirt formatted config file") Libvirt formatted config file  This is the output generated by virsh from the original xm formatted config and what I then added to libvirt using "virsh define"  This is what is used to start the VM.

There are no guarantees libvirt and xl will play nicely together.  These are two different libxl applications, neither of which is aware that the other exits.  libxl supports the notion of "user data", where applications can store private data related to a domain.  xl stores its data with userid "xl".  libvirt stores its data with userid "libvirt-xml".  The bug you are seeing is xl unable to find its user data.  (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c7)) > Ok, it looks like the problem is in the libvirtd libxl driver. > "xl list -l" only works if the VM is started by xl.  No problem in the libvirt libxl driver.  IMO, the bug here is that xl could report a better error message, e.g. "No xl user data found. Is this domain managed by another libxl application?".  (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c8)) > Of course, if I start them with xl then libvirt doesn't see them.  That's correct.  libvirt will only know about domains started by libvirt, similar to the qemu driver where domains started with e.g. 'qemu-kvm ...' are unknown to libvirt.  Again, I think the bug here is an unclear error message from xl.  Do you agree? ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c10)  James Fehlig   2013-10-15 03:07:34 UTC  ``` Bamvor, can you look at this bug?  See my comment above.  I think xl behavior should be improved when e.g. doing 'xl list --long' on a domain not created by libxl (aka a 'foreign' domain).  IMO, the bug can be closed after fixing it upstream and backporting the fix to Factory.

I'm sure there are other ways to get the same information but I was looking for some consistency. Prior to upgrading to opensuse 12.3, I didn't use virsh or libvirt. I could use virt-manager and vm-install to create VMs and manage them with xm.  After upgrading to opensuse 12.3, virt-manager and vm-install use libvirt. This is currently pushing me towards libvirtd and virsh but I still have VMs that were created prior to my upgrade and exist outside libvirtd control.  I was hoping I could still maintain the same workflow and simply replace xm with xl but I guess that isn't going to be possible. I suspect I will end up migrating everything to virsh and libvirtd but until the upstream code for "virsh console" makes it's way into opensuse, I will continue to have to use a mix of commands.  But as James said, useful/informative error messages are always preferred. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c15)  Ralph Schaffner   2013-10-15 18:06:12 UTC  ``` This may actually be a feature request but if xl is suppose to be a generic tool for working with libxl, it might make sense for xl to be able to view or dump data created by libxl even if it is from another toolstack that uses libxl. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c16)  James Fehlig   2013-10-17 18:55:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c14)) > After upgrading to opensuse 12.3, virt-manager and vm-install use libvirt.  virt-manager and vm-install have always used libvirt.  What did change in 12.3 is moving the libvirt xen driver from libvirt-client to libvirtd.  So libvirtd is now required on xen hosts even when using the legacy xend driver.  It has always been required when using the libxl stack.  > This > is currently pushing me towards libvirtd and virsh but I still have VMs that > were created prior to my upgrade and exist outside libvirtd control.  xl is supposed to be compatible with xm, so your existing tooling/scripts should still work.  That said, I'd suggesting using libvirt anyhow since it will provide a stable interface even when upstream Xen swaps one toolstack for another.  > I was hoping I could still maintain the same workflow and simply replace xm > with xl but I guess that isn't going to be possible.  Are there specific issues preventing this?  As mentioned above, upstream Xen strives for xl compatibility with xm.  > until the upstream code for > "virsh console" makes it's way into opensuse  Will be included in 13.1.  FYI, if you live on the bleeding edge, the OBS Virtualization project always contains the latest, SUSE-packaged libvirt, which e.g. contains Bamvor's console patches  <https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/Virtualization/libvirt> ``` [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c17)  James Fehlig   2013-10-17 19:02:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c15)) > This may actually be a feature request but if xl is suppose to be a generic > tool for working with libxl  I don't think that is the purpose of xl - it is simply an "in-tree" libxl app AFAIK.  But that would need to be verified with the upstream Xen community.  But I think the problem here is with the notion "user data" that libxl supports.  Apps can store domain-specific private data with libxl, and I suspect xl is choking on the user data provided by libvirt.  It should ignore this data IMO, and print a message that the domain is unknown or foreign to xl. ``` [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c18)  Ralph Schaffner   2013-10-17 19:24:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c16)) > > I was hoping I could still maintain the same workflow and simply replace xm > > with xl but I guess that isn't going to be possible. >  > Are there specific issues preventing this?

I can't just swap out xl for xm and keep doing that. Before 12.3, I didn't use virsh. ``` [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c19)  James Fehlig   2013-10-17 19:38:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c18)) > Well, since the point of the bug is that I can't do a long list using xl on VMs > created using vm-install which is something I could do with with xm, I'd say > that is a fairly specific issue preventing me from maintaining the same > workflow. ;)  Hehe, touche.  But really the problem here is with the workflow.  You shouldn't mix and match toolstacks. ``` [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c20)  Bamvor Jian Zhang   2014-03-10 05:59:30 UTC  ``` after discuss with xen upstream, there are more than one reasons could lead to the empty message your report. so we could not just report a warning. because we do not know the specific reasons. ``` [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=820873#c21)  Chunyan Liu   2014-07-24 06:28:13 UTC  ``` Upstream Wei Liu's "libxl: synchronise domain configuration" series solved this issue perfectly.
