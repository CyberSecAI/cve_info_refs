The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7111.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to check if the certificate is provided by a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- Potential outcomes include viewing or modifying network traffic, credential stealing, or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic.
