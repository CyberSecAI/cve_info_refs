Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Atlas Systems Aeon software. Specifically, the `Action` and `Form` parameters within the `aeon.dll` page are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application that are then executed in the victim's browser.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability resides in how the `Action` and `Form` parameters of the `aeon.dll` page are handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the web page
    *   Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs to the vulnerable `aeon.dll` page.
*   An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code into the `Action` or `Form` parameters of a URL targeting `aeon.dll`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft malicious URLs containing the exploit payload (malicious JavaScript code).
*   The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link, or the malicious link may be embedded in another site the user visits. The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges on the system.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Vulnerable Versions:** Aeon versions 3.6 and 3.5 are affected.
*   **Vendor Status**: The vulnerability has been reported to the vendor (Atlas Systems), and the vendor has indicated they will change the source code to remediate the issue.
*   **Mitigation Status**: The vendor has issued a fix, as referenced by the "Solution Status: Fixed by Vendor" field.
