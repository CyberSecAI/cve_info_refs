Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-7862:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication in the `DCPluginServelet` component of ManageEngine Desktop Central. Specifically, the `addPlugInUser` action within this servlet could be accessed without any authentication or authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication or authorization requirements to access the `addPlugInUser` action within the `DCPluginServelet`.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The application directly uses parameters provided by the user to create the admin user. This means that an attacker can provide their own values, including the username and password, to create a new admin account.
*   **Insecure API Endpoint:** The `DCPluginServelet` endpoint, intended for plugin user management, was exposed without proper security considerations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Administrator Account Creation:** Attackers can create new administrator accounts on the ManageEngine Desktop Central server.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** After creating an administrator account, an attacker gains full control over the Desktop Central server, allowing them to manage all connected endpoints (desktops, servers, mobile devices).
*   **Remote Code Execution:** With admin access, an attacker can then execute arbitrary code on all devices managed by the Desktop Central server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited using a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `DCPluginServelet` endpoint.
*   **Publicly Accessible Endpoint:** The affected `DCPluginServelet` endpoint is accessible to unauthenticated users and likely exposed on the network where the product is deployed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the ManageEngine Desktop Central server. The server does not need to be exposed on the public Internet; local network access is sufficient.
*   **No Credentials:** No user credentials or prior authentication are needed to exploit this vulnerability, making it highly accessible.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to send a HTTP GET request and encode the request URI with the required parameters.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of ManageEngine Desktop Central from v7 onwards are vulnerable.
*   **Exploit Availability:** A Metasploit module was created to exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Timeline**: The vulnerability was disclosed as a 0-day due to the vendor's slow response to the initial disclosure.
*  **Fix**: The vendor released a fix in build 90109, and recommended to also update ServiceDesk Plus if integrated with Desktop Central
