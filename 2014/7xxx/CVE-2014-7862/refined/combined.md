# ManageEngine Desktop Central Administrator Account Creation

 [Back to Search](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

### ManageEngine Desktop Central Administrator Account Creation

Disclosed
12/31/2014

Created
05/30/2018

#### Description

This module exploits an administrator account creation vulnerability in Desktop Central
from v7 onwards by sending a crafted request to DCPluginServelet. It has been tested in
several versions of Desktop Central (including MSP) from v7 onwards.

#### Author(s)

* Pedro Ribeiro <pedrib@gmail.com>

#### Development

* [Source Code](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/auxiliary/admin/http/manage_engine_dc_create_admin.rb)
* [History](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/commits/master//modules/auxiliary/admin/http/manage_engine_dc_create_admin.rb)

#### Module Options

To display the available options, load the module within the Metasploit console and run the commands 'show options' or 'show advanced':

```
msf > use auxiliary/admin/http/manage_engine_dc_create_admin
msf auxiliary(manage_engine_dc_create_admin) > show actions
    ...actions...
msf auxiliary(manage_engine_dc_create_admin) > set ACTION < action-name >
msf auxiliary(manage_engine_dc_create_admin) > show options
    ...show and set options...
msf auxiliary(manage_engine_dc_create_admin) > run
```

Time is precious, so I don’t want to do something manually that I can automate. Leveraging the Metasploit Framework when automating any task keeps us from having to re-create the wheel as we can use the existing libraries and focus our efforts where it matters.

# [The ManageOwnage Series, part X]: 0-day administrator account creation in Desktop Central

---

*From*: Pedro Ribeiro <pedrib () gmail com>

*Date*: Wed, 31 Dec 2014 02:17:55 +0000

---

```
Hi,

This is part 10 of the ManageOwnage series. For previous parts, see [1].

This time we have a vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user
to create an administrator account, which can then be used to execute
code on all devices managed by Desktop Central (desktops, servers,
mobile devices, etc).
An auxiliary Metasploit module that creates the administrator account
has been released and its currently awaiting review [2]. I will leave
to someone else the task of creating an exploit that executes code on
all managed devices (it's not hard to write but testing it properly
might take a fair few hours).

I am releasing this as a 0 day as 112 days have elapsed since I first
communicated the vulnerability to ManageEngine. I received many
promises about getting updates but they were very evasive (a
disclosure timeline is at the bottom of this email). The full advisory
text is below, and a copy can be obtained from my repo [3].

Regards,
Pedro
