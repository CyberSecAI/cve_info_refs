Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper verification of the SSL/TLS certificate chain. This makes the applications vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can intercept, view, or modify network traffic meant to be secured by HTTPS.
*   **Credential Stealing:** Sensitive data, including login credentials, could be intercepted by the attacker.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the application's functionality and the data being exchanged, a successful MITM attack might allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The primary attack vector is a network-based MITM attack. This can be achieved by an attacker on the same network as the victim's device. This could include public Wi-Fi networks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network as the victim.
*   **Network Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and potentially modify network traffic between the Android device and the intended server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Applications:** The attacker benefits from awareness of which specific apps are vulnerable to this type of attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided documents refer to a tracking spreadsheet (available at [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing)), which lists specific vulnerable Android apps.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and publicized in part through testing with CERT Tapioca.
*   The vulnerability has led to settlements by the FTC with some vendors.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by CERT as VU#582497, and CVE-2014-7564 is assigned to track this specific vulnerability.
*   CVSS metrics:
    *   Base Score: 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N) - High impact and exploitability
    *   Temporal Score: 7 - Exploitable, not fully remediated, and confirmed to occur
*   CWE-295 Improper Certificate Validation.
*   CWE-296 Improper Handling of Certificate Validation
