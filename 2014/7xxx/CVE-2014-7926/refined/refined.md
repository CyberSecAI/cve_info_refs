Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-7926:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect handling of a zero-length quantifier in the regular expression engine of the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library. This faulty handling leads to memory corruption when a regular expression with a zero-length quantifier is processed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is the potential for memory corruption due to the incorrect processing of regular expressions.
*   **Incorrect Optimization:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect optimization of patterns containing a zero-length quantifier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service condition, likely through a crash of the application utilizing the vulnerable ICU library.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, some sources indicate a potential for arbitrary code execution in the context of the sandboxed renderer process, which could allow for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Content:** A specially crafted website or web content containing a malicious regular expression pattern can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Application Input:** Any application utilizing the vulnerable ICU library to process user-supplied or external regular expressions could be susceptible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious regular expression pattern to the vulnerable software, typically through a website or other input mechanism.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not typically require any special privileges or authentication to exploit this flaw.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `regexcmp.cpp` file within the ICU source code.
*   The fix involves a patch that addresses the incorrect optimization and includes new test cases.
*   The vulnerability was also identified in the Chromium browser and was fixed in Chrome version 40.0.2214.91.
*   The specific issue was fixed in upstream ICU project through changeset 36727 "Regex, fix incorrect optimization of patterns with a zero length quantifier {0}".

**Summary of Impact:**

The CVE-2014-7926 vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially cause a denial of service (and potentially arbitrary code execution) through a malformed regular expression with a zero-length quantifier. This is due to a flaw in the regex engine optimization within the ICU library. Exploitation is possible through crafting malicious web pages and can lead to application crashes or even arbitrary code execution.
