Based on the provided context, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
  - The advisory mentions multiple vulnerabilities related to authentication bypass.
  -  Half-baked security workarounds that introduced command injection issues.
  -  Problems in session management allowing unauthenticated file uploads.
  - Default user credentials with empty passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Authentication bypass (CVE-2014-7857), details withheld
  - Check_login bypass vulnerability (CVE-2014-7858)
  - Buffer overflow in `login_mgr.cgi` and `file_sharing.cgi` (CVE-2014-7859)
  - Unauthenticated photo publishing (CVE-2014-7860)
  - Command injection
  - Unauthenticated file upload to arbitrary locations
  - Default, unchangeable user credentials (root, nobody) with empty passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Remote code execution
  - Full control of the affected devices
  - Unauthenticated file upload

**Attack vectors:**
  - Remote access via web interface
  - Exploitation of vulnerabilities in CGI scripts (login_mgr.cgi, file_sharing.cgi)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Remote attacker, no authentication required in some cases.
