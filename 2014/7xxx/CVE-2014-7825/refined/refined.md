## Analysis of CVE-2014-7825

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7825:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2014-7825 and describes it as:
"An out-of-bounds memory access flaw was found in the syscall tracing functionality of the Linux kernel's perf subsystem. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system."
This matches the general description of the vulnerability.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper bounds checking of the `syscall_nr` variable within the `perf_syscall_enter()` and `perf_syscall_exit()` functions in the Linux kernel's perf subsystem.
- Specifically, the code fails to verify that the `syscall_nr` variable is less than `NR_syscalls` before accessing a bit array.
- This lack of check allows for out-of-bounds access to memory.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to read memory outside the bounds of allocated memory, potentially leading to a crash.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** An unprivileged local user can exploit this flaw to cause a system crash.
- **Potential Information Leak:** As mentioned in one of the comments, for other configurations it can aid an attacker with mapping the kernel address space layout under systems with kASLR enabled.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- **Local:** A local attacker needs to execute code on the target system.
- **Syscall tracing enabled:** The system must have syscall tracing via perf enabled.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local, unprivileged user access:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system.
- **No special privileges needed:** No specific system privileges are necessary to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Syscall tracing knowledge:** While not explicitly required, some knowledge of how syscall tracing works or a ready made exploit is needed to trigger the out-of-bounds memory access.
 
**7. Additional Information:**
* The fix for this issue was added to the mainline kernel via commit [086ba77a6db00ed858ff07451bedee197df868c9](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c?id=086ba77a6db00ed858ff07451bedee197df868c9)
* The vulnerability affects Linux kernels shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.
* This vulnerability was reported by Robert Święcki.

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-7825 is a moderate severity vulnerability, it is caused by a lack of proper bounds checking within the Linux Kernel's perf subsystem, allowing unprivileged local users to cause a denial of service, potentially leak kernel information with crafted syscall numbers.
