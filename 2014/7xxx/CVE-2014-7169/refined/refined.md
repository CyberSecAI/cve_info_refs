  "CVE-2014-7169": {
    "description": "It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-6271 was incomplete, and Bash still allowed certain characters to be injected into other environments via specially crafted environment variables. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.",
    "root_cause": "Incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, leading to Bash still parsing specially crafted environment variables as function definitions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect parsing of environment variables.",
       "Insufficient sanitization of input in Bash environment variables allowing for code injection.",
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers could execute arbitrary shell commands, potentially bypassing environment restrictions, and gain unauthorized access to the system.",
    "attack_vector": "Specially crafted environment variables that are processed by a vulnerable Bash instance through remote services or applications (e.g., CGI scripts in web servers, OpenSSH with ForceCommand, or DHCP clients).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker capable of setting environment variables.",
     "other_details": "The vulnerability exists in GNU Bash versions through 4.3 bash43-025 and was caused due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.  An additional fix,  including a function decorator to prevent unintended header passthrough to Bash, was implemented to resolve this issue."
