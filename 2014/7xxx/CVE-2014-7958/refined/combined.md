I’ve used BPS on my sites for MANY years and can’t say enough about how well it works. Best security available. And the support is terrific.

Great service and note it’s the ONLY plugin that can claim to have had ZERO hacks ever since it was launched many years ago. Its name is Bulletproof and it is! It does what it was built for! Set it and forget it. If I could give this plugin 10 stars I would!Having read the reviews of other plugin companies, they are selling you add-on malware removal packages which immediately flags up the fact that if their plugin is so good, why is there even a need for malware removal at all? Makes you think! They offer you a “free” plugin which then creates a problem so they can then sell you the solution! That’s not really a free plugin at all and it costs you all that money, hassle, website downtime and stress too. When I’ve asked these companies why is that? they have no answer! Sound familiar?

The Pro version is a fantastic security plugin with a firewall that will lock down and secure your WordPress website. I had a few minor issues, and the creator was right there to assist me in solving my problems. The price is fantastic, and I couldn’t ask for more.

Simplicity is best, and this rocks, it performs faster than all other security plugins without compromising protection, and I’ve used this now for over 6 years without any incidents or security problems. Support is very helpful and proactive, even on the free version.
