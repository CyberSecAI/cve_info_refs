The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7321.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. The applications do not verify if the certificate was provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This allows the attacker to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be on a public or untrusted WiFi network.
