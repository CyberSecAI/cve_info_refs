The provided content relates to CVE-2014-7091.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, applications fail to verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device, can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This allows the attacker to intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. Depending on the application, this could lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker intercepts communication between the vulnerable Android application and the server.
*   **Network:** The attacker must be on the same network as the victim device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
*   **Interception capability:**  The attacker needs the ability to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.
