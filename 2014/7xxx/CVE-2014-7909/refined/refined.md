Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-7909:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an uninitialized memory read in Skia, the 2D rendering engine used in Chromium. Specifically, the issue arises in `SkDashPathEffect` when its fields are not initialized, leading to a hash key based on uninitialized data when flattened for paint deduping in old SkPicture code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uninitialized memory read
- Non-deterministic hash generation due to uninitialized data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is non-deterministic behavior due to a hash based on uninitialized data, which might be unreliable.
- Could lead to crashes or undefined behavior that might be exploitable in other ways.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when rendering content that utilizes `SkDashPathEffect` in a way that triggers the old paint deduping code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to craft content that utilizes `SkDashPathEffect` in a specific way that triggers the vulnerability.
- No particular privilege or position is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**
- The fix involved ensuring that `SkDashPathEffect` fields are always initialized.
- The vulnerability was found by miaubiz.
- A patch was made to Skia at <https://skia.googlesource.com/skia/+/1c577cd3ee331944b9061ee0eec147b211ee563c>
