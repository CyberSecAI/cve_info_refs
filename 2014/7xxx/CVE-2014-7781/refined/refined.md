  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",

      "Improper validation of the SSL certificate chain, failing to verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority."

    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, allowing them to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
