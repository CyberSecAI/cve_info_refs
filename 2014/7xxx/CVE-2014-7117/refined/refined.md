  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the SSL chain, leading to the application not verifying if the certificate produced by the site was provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the affected Android device."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device."
