## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1939)

## Topic

Updated openstack-trove packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Database (trove) is Database as a Service for Openstack. It runs
entirely on OpenStack, with the goal of allowing users to quickly and
easily utilize the features of a database without the burden of handling
complex administrative tasks. Cloud users and database administrators can
provision and manage multiple database instances as needed.

It was found that the processutils.execute() and strutils.mask\_password()
functions did not correctly sanitize the authentication details from their
output before storing them in log files. This could allow an attacker with
read access to these log files to obtain sensitive information such as
passwords. (CVE-2014-7230, CVE-2014-7231)

The openstack-trove packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149745)

All openstack-trove users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

### Bug Description

Currently when execute() throws a ProcessExecutionError, it returns the command without masking passwords. In the one place where it logs the command, it correctly masks the password.

It would be prudent to mask the password in the exception as well so that upstream catchers don't have to go through the mask\_password() motions.

The same also goes for stdout and stderr information which should be sanitized.

Thanks for your bug report. It does look like this could lead to information leakage in the exception handler cases where attempts > 0 and possibly when the exception is propagated up (when attempts == 0).

I'm marking the OSSA bug task as incomplete until discussed with other VMT members as to whether we will issue an advisory for this problem.

Grant, with respect, I disagree with your assessment. The default values are attempts = 1 and ignore\_exit\_code is False and check\_exit\_code is None. Therefore, by default, an invocation of execute that results in an error would result in an exception being thrown.

Whether you need to issue a security advisory or not may depend more on the incompleteness of the conditions in mask\_password (strutils.mask\_password) than just whether this function results in a thrown exception or not.

In testing my changes, I found that the masks in mask\_password did not, for example, catch the usage

/usr/sbin/mysqld --password=top-secret

2014-07-19 18:35:01.415 20588 ERROR openstack.common.processutils [-] Running cmd (subprocess): /usr/sbin/mysqld --password=secret

They did catch

/usr/sbin/mysqld --password="top-secret"

2014-07-19 18:35:48.686 20605 ERROR openstack.common.processutils [-] Running cmd (subprocess): /usr/sbin/mysqld --password="\*\*\*"

I do intend to enter a bug to make the strings in strutils.mask\_password more robust.

Thanks for the additional information Amrith.

I guess all I was trying to point out was that the command is definitely being logged here without using mask\_password here:

<https://github.com/openstack/oslo-incubator/blob/master/openstack/common/processutils.py#L204>

I'm going to mark the OSSA task as confirmed. Especially if the mask password implementation does not catch all use cases.

Grant, thanks for the clarification. I've also entered [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/+bug/1345233](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ossa/%2Bbug/1345233) and will work on the mask\_passwords() thing as well.

We should be looking more precisely at the affected list and check which projects are using execute() with command that have password passed on the command line.

For each identified affected project we'll need a target series and a patch for each affected branch (we are looking at 12 (stable) + 6 (master) + 3 (oslo) = 21 potential reviews!)

In the meantime, this is impact description draft #1:

After looking more closely at the affected project usage, it's not as broad as it firsts sounded. Either service does not log the exception/mask\_password, either vulnerable are used without any password/sensitive data on command line.

Yet here is a more concrete list of vulnerable code:

execute: [stable/havana]:

 \* cinder (cinder/brick/iscsi/iscsi.py:414),

 \* nova (no clear vulnerable usage, yet the exception is re-implemented in tools/esx/guest\_tool.py and nova/virt/powervm/operator.py:213 is logging the exception)

mask\_password: [stable/icehouse]:

 \* trove (trove/extensions/mysql/service.py:85)

execute: [stable/icehouse]:

 \* cinder (cinder/zonemanager/drivers/brocade/brcd\_fc\_zone\_client\_cli.py:331),

 \* nova (unclear),

 \* trove (unclear)

mask\_password: [master]:

 \* trove (trove/instance/service.py:181)

execute: [master]:

 \* cinder (cinder/zonemanager/drivers/brocade/brcd\_fc\_zone\_client\_cli.py:336),

 \* trove (trove/guestagent/strategies/restore/couchbase\_impl.py:193)

@trove-coresec and @cinder-coresec: Can you please confirmed the impacted code ?

@nova-coresec: Can you please double check Nova codebase for those vulnerability ?

@slicknik Can you confirm trove/icehouse is not impacted? This may leak password if the request does not encapsulate password with '"''

  <https://github.com/openstack/trove/blob/stable/icehouse/trove/extensions/mysql/service.py#L85>

e.g., >>> mask\_password("requests.... password=SECRET")

u'requests.... password=SECRET'

   <https://github.com/openstack/cinder/blob/stable/havana/cinder/brick/iscsi/iscsi.py#L419>

e.g., if the exception is logged it might leak the password to logs (either because password is not encapsulated with '"', either because the mask\_password is not called)

@Tracy Jones: Can you explain why did you added "compute" tag ? I double check nova source code and couldn't find a clear code path that would leak a password by logging ProcessExecutionError exception.

Author: Amrith Kumar <email address hidden>

Date: Thu Aug 14 00:52:02 2014 -0400

Mask passwords in exceptions and error messages

When a ProcessExecutionError is thrown by processutils.execute(), the

    exception may contain information such as password. Upstream

    applications that just log the message (as several appear to do) could

    inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to the

    log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke

    strutils.mask\_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the

    exception. A test case has been added to ensure that all three are

    properly masked.

OSSA is aware of this change request.

commit 63c99a0fd5fa7f60b33c7fa756020e5562b6afb0

Author: Amrith Kumar <email address hidden>

Date: Thu Jul 24 17:04:42 2014 -0400

Mask passwords in exceptions and error messages

When a ProcessExecutionError is thrown by processutils.execute(), the

    exception may contain information such as password. Upstream

    applications that just log the message (as several appear to do) could

    inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to the

    log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke

    strutils.mask\_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the

    exception. A test case has been added to ensure that all three are

    properly masked.

OSSA is aware of this change request.

I'm not sure, isn't the exception info in the logs restricted access anyway here? We don't typically emit exception info to end user, however if there are places in the client this happens (it shouldn't it should be generalized REST faults) that should certainly be fixed.

I do agree that it might be worthwhile to scrub these, in the logs even for those submitting support requests, but I'm not sure i see this as a sec issue currently.

@John Griffith: Well password leak in system logs is considered as a vulnerability because they may end up being shared with third parties.

Though, about the code in iscsi.py#L419, it's not clear if this exception will get logged and if the iscsi admin password will get leaked or not.

Anyway, I think cinder should triage this one for stable/havana and stable/icehouse in order to update the openstack common code of processutils.

Mask passwords in exceptions and error messages

When a ProcessExecutionError is thrown by processutils.execute(), the

    exception may contain information such as password. Upstream

    applications that just log the message (as several appear to do) could

    inadvertently expose these passwords to a user with read access to the

    log files. It is therefore considered prudent to invoke

    strutils.mask\_password() on the command, stdout and stderr in the

    exception.

So far, only Cinder, Nova and Trove have been confirmed. Here is the updated impact description:

Title: Potential password leak to log when shell command fail or because of incorrect password masking

Reporter: Amrith Kumar (Tesora)

Products: Cinder, Nova, Trove

Versions: up to 2013.2.4, 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1

Description:

Amrith Kumar from Tesora reported two vulnerabilities in the processutils.execute() and strutils.mask\_password() functions available from oslo-incubator that are copied into each project's code. An attacker with read access to the services' logs may obtain passwords used as a parameter of a command that have failed or when the mask\_password did not mask password properly. All services are impacted.

On Impact desc:

title is way too long. maybe "Potential leak of passwords into log files"

"All services are impacted" seem to go against "Cinder, Nova, Trove". Maybe remove the mention altogether ?

```

There are (at least) two CVE IDs needed because of the different
vulnerability types. The older code in which processutils.execute was
simply logging cmd directly, without any masking step, can be
considered an instance of the
<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html> issue. For this, use
CVE-2014-7230.

The older code with a short _FORMAT_PATTERNS list, with a later
replacement by longer _FORMAT_PATTERNS_1 and _FORMAT_PATTERNS_2 lists,
can be considered an instance of the
<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/184.html> issue. Bug #1343604
mentions 'mask_password did not, for example, catch the usage ...
/usr/sbin/mysqld --password=top-secret ... They did catch ...
/usr/sbin/mysqld --password="top-secret" ... make the strings in
strutils.mask_password more robust.' For this, use CVE-2014-7231.

The additional complication is that there were apparently already
releases with incomplete fixes for CVE-2014-7230. Separate CVE IDs are
needed when parts of the problem were fixed in different releases. For
example, Cinder 2013.2.4 contains a fix for the "Running cmd
(subprocess)" logging problem but apparently does not contain a fix
for the "Running cmd (SSH)" logging problem. The patch for the latter
is shown in the
<https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/trove/commit/?id=9672744f090d462cac5eb757ceaacd7122362708>
commit. Is this a remaining vulnerability in Cinder 2013.2.4 and
possibly other products? If so, then we will assign another CVE ID.

# USN-2405-1: OpenStack Cinder vulnerabilities

11 November 2014

OpenStack Cinder could be made to expose sensitive information over the
network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [cinder](/security/cves?package=cinder) - OpenStack storage service

## Details

Duncan Thomas discovered that OpenStack Cinder did not properly track the

file format when using the GlusterFS of Smbfs drivers. A remote

authenticated user could exploit this to potentially obtain file contents

from the compute host. ([CVE-2014-3641](/security/CVE-2014-3641))

Amrith Kumar discovered that OpenStack Cinder did not properly sanitize log

message contents. Under certain circumstances, a local attacker with read

access to Cinder log files could obtain access to sensitive information.

([CVE-2014-7230](/security/CVE-2014-7230))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1147722#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-30 00:30:07 UTC  ``` The OpenStack project reports:  "" Reporter: Amrith Kumar (Tesora) Products: Cinder, Nova, Trove Versions: up to 2013.2.3, 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2  Description: Amrith Kumar from Tesora reported two vulnerabilities in the processutils.execute() and strutils.mask_password() functions available from oslo-incubator that are copied into each project's code. An attacker with read access to the services' logs may obtain passwords used as a parameter of a command that have failed or when the mask_password did not mask passwords properly. ""  CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/846>  References: <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1343604> <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1345233>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1147722#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-30 05:37:49 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-7230](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7230) and [CVE-2014-7231](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7231). Quoting <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/853>  "" There are (at least) two CVE IDs needed because of the different vulnerability types. The older code in which processutils.execute was simply logging cmd directly, without any masking step, can be considered an instance of the <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/532.html> issue. For this, use [CVE-2014-7230](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7230).  The older code with a short _FORMAT_PATTERNS list, with a later replacement by longer _FORMAT_PATTERNS_1 and _FORMAT_PATTERNS_2 lists, can be considered an instance of the <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/184.html> issue. [Bug #1343604](show_bug.cgi?id=1343604 "CLOSED ERRATA - RHEL7 RPMs: Upgrade jbossts to 4.17.34.Final-redhat-1") mentions 'mask_password did not, for example, catch the usage ... /usr/sbin/mysqld --password=top-secret ... They did catch ... /usr/sbin/mysqld --password="top-secret" ... make the strings in strutils.mask_password more robust.' For this, use [CVE-2014-7231](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7231).
