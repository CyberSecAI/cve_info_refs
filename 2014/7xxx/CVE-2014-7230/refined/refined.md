{
  "CVE-2014-7230": {
    "description": "It was found that the processutils.execute() and strutils.mask_password() functions did not correctly sanitize the authentication details from their output before storing them in log files. This could allow an attacker with read access to these log files to obtain sensitive information such as passwords.",
    "root_cause": "The `processutils.execute()` and `strutils.mask_password()` functions in OpenStack did not properly sanitize authentication details before logging, leading to potential exposure of sensitive information.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of log data",
      "Insufficient password masking"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with read access to log files could obtain sensitive information, such as passwords.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Access to system logs"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Read access to the system's log files."
