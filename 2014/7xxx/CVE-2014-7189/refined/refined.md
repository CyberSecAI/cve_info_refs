- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of client certificates when TLS session tickets are disabled in Go's `crypto/tls` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A malicious client can falsely assert ownership of any client certificate it wishes. This occurs when a TLS server enables client authentication with certificates and explicitly sets `SessionTicketsDisabled` to `true`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious client can impersonate any other client, potentially gaining unauthorized access or privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious client connects to a vulnerable TLS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to establish a TLS connection with the vulnerable server. The server must have client authentication enabled using certificates, and `SessionTicketsDisabled` must be set to `true`.
