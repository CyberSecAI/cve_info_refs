Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-7199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of CSS within uploaded SVG files. Specifically, the MediaWiki software did not adequately sanitize or filter CSS code present in `<style>` elements within SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By embedding malicious CSS (which can include JavaScript) into SVG files, attackers can potentially inject and execute arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser when they view the manipulated SVG image.
- **Inadequate CSS Filtering:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization and filtering of the CSS code. The software failed to prevent external URLs within CSS style declarations in SVG files. This includes constructs like `@import url()` or `url()` in style attributes or within `<style>` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal user cookies and session information.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers can use this access to potentially steal data from the application, or manipulate the content.
- **Defacement:** Attackers may deface website content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SVG File Upload:** The attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious CSS.
- **CSS Injection:** The malicious CSS is injected within the `<style>` tags or attributes of the SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload SVG files to the MediaWiki installation. This typically requires an account with upload privileges.
- **Knowledge of CSS and XSS:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft SVG files with malicious CSS that can execute JavaScript.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability existed in how MediaWiki handled `<style>` elements in SVG files, specifically:
   - It didn't properly filter `@import url()` directives.
   - It didn't normalize or filter CSS style elements and attributes.
   - It lacked robust checks for attributes containing CSS.
- Patches were implemented to:
   - Filter `<style>` elements.
   - Normalize style elements and attributes before filtering.
   - Add checks for attributes containing CSS.
   - Implement unit tests to prevent regressions.
