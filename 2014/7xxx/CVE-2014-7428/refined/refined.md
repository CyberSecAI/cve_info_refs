**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is widespread across multiple Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is maintained to track affected applications, available fixes, and other relevant information.
- The CERT/CC used a tool called "CERT Tapioca" to perform dynamic SSL validation testing on Android apps.
- The vulnerability has been publicly known since October 16, 2012, but was officially published on 2014-09-03, and last updated on 2016-11-08.
