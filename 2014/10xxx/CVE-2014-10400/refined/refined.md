## CVE-2014-10400

The provided content discusses a vulnerability in CGILua's session.lua library related to predictable session IDs. Although the content mentions CVE-2014-2875, this is not the CVE requested for analysis.

The relevant details are:

*   **Vulnerability:** Predictable Session ID generation in CGILua.
*   **Affected Versions:** CGILua 5.0.x, 5.1.x, and 5.2 alpha.
*   **Root Cause:**
    *   CGILua 5.2 alpha generates session IDs based on OS time, making them insufficiently random and guessable.
    *   CGILua 5.1.x contains a bug that causes it to always generate the same session ID.
    *   CGILua 5.0.x generates sequential, non-random 8-digit session IDs.
*   **Attack Vector:** Remote attackers can guess valid session IDs and perform session hijacking.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain access to other users' sessions.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Attackers need to be able to view the source code (available on GitHub) to understand the session ID generation mechanism or simply brute-force the IDs.
