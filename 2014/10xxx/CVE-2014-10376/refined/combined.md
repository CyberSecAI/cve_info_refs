Lean and mean with a minimalistic (and overidable) button/css. Kudos to the developer! No bloat, no jQuery.
After trying 8 other plugins this is the clear winner!

I really like this plugin. I would add some more features to get a five stars rating (for instance the option to choose more simbols, colors and size)
