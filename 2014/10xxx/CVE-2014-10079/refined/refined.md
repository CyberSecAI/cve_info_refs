```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The client enrolment procedure allows an unauthenticated attacker to register a client to a rogue backup server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Reflected XSS",
    "Source code/sensitive information disclosure",
    "Privilege escalation",
    "Remote code execution",
    "Denial of Service",
     "Poorly implemented business logic",
     "Insecure storage of credentials (MD5)",
     "Poor mysql implementation (default root user configured with a simple password)",
     "Self XSS"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can exfiltrate full disk backups from a target machine via a rogue server. They can also create a new admin user on the client, schedule backups, specify encryption keys, restore backups to attacker controlled virtual machine gaining full access to the data, execute commands with system level privileges, manipulate the web console, kill AV, drop the firewall, access the registry, dump password hashes, and ultimately render the system unbootable.  Reflected XSS can lead to execution of arbitrary scripts in the browser.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network based attacks leveraging HTTP/S connections to ports 6060 and 6061.  Also, by exploiting the client enrolment procedure, specifically, by registering to a rogue server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the vulnerable server and/or client."
