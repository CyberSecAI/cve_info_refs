Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

The D-Link DAP-1360 device's web interface lacks proper security measures, leading to CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically:

*   **CSRF:** The web interface allows state-changing actions (like modifying MAC filter settings or adding/removing MAC addresses) via simple HTTP GET requests without proper CSRF protection (e.g., anti-CSRF tokens).
*   **XSS:** User-supplied input, specifically MAC addresses, is not properly sanitized when added through the web interface, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  The device is vulnerable to CSRF attacks because it processes state-changing requests without verifying that they are initiated by the user.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The device is vulnerable to persistent XSS because it does not sanitize the input when adding MAC addresses and stores the script in the configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker could force a logged-in user's browser to perform actions on the device without the user's knowledge or consent.  This could include:
    *   Changing the MAC filter mode (e.g. allowing or denying all traffic).
    *   Adding or removing MAC addresses from the filter list, potentially disrupting network access.
*  **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the device's configuration, which would then be executed when a user visits the affected pages. This could allow an attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious site.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user, similar to a CSRF attack but with more control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker can create a malicious webpage containing the crafted HTTP GET requests, and trick a logged-in user of the device to visit that page.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject the malicious JavaScript code by adding it as a MAC address via a crafted HTTP request. The injected script will execute in the user's browser when they access a specific page in the device's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker must be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage and the user must be logged into the vulnerable device at the time of the attack.
*   **XSS:** An attacker needs to send a specific HTTP request to the device to inject the malicious code. A user must access the vulnerable page to trigger the injected code. The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network, depending on the device's firewall configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided links demonstrate the specific HTTP requests required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
* The vulnerability was found in D-Link DAP-1360 with Firmware 1.0.0. Other versions may also be vulnerable.
* D-Link has planned to release a fix in a later firmware release, although delays were mentioned.
* The advisory also notes that the DAP-1360/A/E1A with firmware version 2.5.4 or later includes fixes.
* The XSS is persistent because the malicious code is stored in the deviceâ€™s configuration.
