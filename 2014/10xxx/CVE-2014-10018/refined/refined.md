{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the 'essid' parameter in the Teracom Modem's web interface.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the modem's web interface, specifically the 'country.html' page, with a crafted 'essid' parameter that contains malicious JavaScript.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the modem's web interface (typically on the local network). No prior authentication is explicitly mentioned in the exploit, however, the provided request includes 'Authorization: Basic VGhpc2lzbm90Ok15b3JnaW5hbHBhc3N3b3Jk', implying some form of basic authentication might be required."
