Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in PHPJabbers Appointment Scheduler 2.0, as referenced by CVE-2014-10010 and CVE-2014-10001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
The identified vulnerabilities stem from a lack of proper input validation and security measures in the PHPJabbers Appointment Scheduler 2.0 application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks. Specifically, the `i18n[1][name]` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. The lack of CSRF protection allows an attacker to craft malicious requests that can be triggered by a user.
3.  **Local File Disclosure (LFD):** The application is vulnerable to LFD attacks. By manipulating the `id` parameter in the `pjBackup` controller, an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, which can be used to steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform actions on the victim's behalf.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user, such as creating new services or adding administrative users.
*   **LFD:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as database configuration files (`db.inc.php`) or system files (`/etc/passwd`).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** Requires a user to trigger the crafted XSS payload (e.g., by visiting a malicious page).
*   **CSRF:** Requires a victim to be logged into the application and to visit a page that contains the malicious CSRF request.
*   **LFD:** Requires the attacker to craft a URL with a manipulated `id` parameter in the `pjBackup` controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to inject the XSS payload in a location that the user will interact with.
*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request.
*   **LFD:** The attacker needs to know the application URL, controller, and action to manipulate.

**Additional Information:**
* The provided exploit code includes HTML forms that demonstrate the CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities. These forms automatically submit on page load, triggering the malicious actions.
* The LFD vulnerability is demonstrated by providing example URLs that access sensitive files.
* The content mentions two CVEs, 2014-10010 and 2014-10001.
