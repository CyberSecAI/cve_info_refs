## Description

The User Domain Whitelist/Blacklist plugin limits user registration to only registrants with an email address from the domain white list below OR prevents registrants with an email address from the domain black list below from registering. For example, *hortense@example.com* would only be allowed to register if *example.com* appeared in the domain white list. Conversely, *hortense@example.com* would **not** be allowed to register if *example.com* appeared in the domain black list. Anyone attempting to register using an email address outside the white list or inside te black list will receive the error message below.Anyone attempting to register using an email address outside the white list will receive an error message. Both the domain whitelist and the error message can be modified via the plugin options page (available under the Settings menu).

Plugin is working as it should for me. I‚Äôm running it along with Theme My Login and it was the first plugin of its type, to not throw an error when using it in conjunction with Theme My Login. I‚Äôm using it for Whitelisting purposes. Keep up the great work!
