Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The `create_response` function in `server/server.c` of psensor lacks a check to ensure that requested files are within the webserver directory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Directory traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can access files outside of the intended webserver directory, potentially exposing sensitive system information or configuration files.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through network requests to the psensor server. The lack of path validation allows the attacker to use directory traversal sequences in the filename to access files outside the designated webserver directory.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the psensor server.
