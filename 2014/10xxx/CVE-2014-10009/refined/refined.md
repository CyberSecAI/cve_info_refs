The provided content includes information about CVE-2014-10009.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization within the Stark CRM v1.0 application. Specifically, the application fails to validate user input within several POST parameters, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Additionally, the application lacks sufficient checks to verify the validity of HTTP requests allowing for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores user-provided input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users view the data.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application does not properly validate the origin of HTTP requests. An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions without their knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser session via XSS.
*   An attacker can perform actions with administrative privileges if a logged-in user visits a malicious website via CSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:** By submitting malicious script code through vulnerable POST parameters.
*   **CSRF:** By tricking a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or link that sends forged requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the application through POST parameters to exploit XSS.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or link to exploit CSRF.
