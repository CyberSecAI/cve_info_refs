- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient validation of HTTP request origin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator to visit a specially crafted webpage to change the SSID and its password.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing a link that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, triggers a change in the modem's configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a specially crafted webpage. The administrator must already be logged into the modem's web interface.
