The provided content describes CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in D-Link DAP-1360 devices.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   **CSRF:** The web interface of the D-Link DAP-1360 does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to induce a victim to perform unwanted actions on the device.
*   **XSS:** The web interface does not sanitize user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed by the victim's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The device is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, which can be exploited to change MAC filter settings (mode, addresses).
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The device is vulnerable to persistent XSS, which can be exploited by injecting malicious scripts via MAC address settings, which will then be executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker can change the MAC filter settings of the device, potentially disrupting network access for legitimate users by blocking or allowing specific MAC addresses.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, allowing them to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker could craft a malicious web page containing forged requests that, when visited by an authenticated user, can change device settings.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts by providing it as part of the MAC address when adding a new MAC filter. This injected script is then executed when a user navigates to the specific page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker must lure a logged-in user to visit a malicious page or resource. The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the device.
*  **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the device's web interface that contains malicious JavaScript code. The attacker does not necessarily need to be on the same network as the device.

The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by providing specific URLs showing how to exploit the vulnerabilities, such as how to change the MAC filter mode (disabled/allow/deny) and how to add/remove MAC addresses, as well as a specific XSS example using a javascript alert. It also provides timelines for when the vulnerability was reported and disclosed.
