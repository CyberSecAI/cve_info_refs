Although it’s not updated very much, it seems to work pretty good with Version 4.5.2
Indeed that doesn’t mean there aren’t any vulnerabilities. Since the Author doesn’t keep up with the Wordpress updates, caution is still advisable.

Simple to use. Tracks site and page visits (including basic visitor info, day, time, etc.).
Thanks!
