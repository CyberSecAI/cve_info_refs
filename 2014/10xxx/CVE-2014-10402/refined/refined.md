Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-10402:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-10401 in the Perl5 Database Interface (DBI), specifically within the DBD::File driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The DBD::File drivers can open files from directories other than those specified in the `f_dir` attribute, which is part of the data source name (DSN). This bypasses intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can achieve information disclosure by accessing files outside of the intended directory scope.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the data source name (DSN) provided to the DBD::File driver. By manipulating the DSN, an attacker can access files outside the designated `f_dir`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the data source name (DSN) used by the application when connecting using the vulnerable DBD::File driver.
- The attacker can potentially access the server file system.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is a direct result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-10401.
- The provided Debian Security Advisory (DLA 3035-1) indicates that the issue was addressed in `libdbi-perl` version `1.636-1+deb9u2` for Debian 9 stretch.
