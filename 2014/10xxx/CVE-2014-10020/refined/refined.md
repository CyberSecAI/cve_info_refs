Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-10020

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `login.php` script of Simple e-document v1.31. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize the `username` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `username` field.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can bypass the login mechanism without providing valid credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker full access to the application, potentially leading to further malicious activities.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, such as user information, documents and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `login.php` script with a malicious SQL payload in the `username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application, typically through a web browser or a tool capable of sending HTTP requests.
- No prior authentication is needed to perform this attack, as the vulnerability exists in the login process itself.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required for crafting the exploit payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `login.php` file.
- The vulnerable code snippet constructs a SQL query:
```php
$sql = "SELECT * From edocphp_users WHERE username='$username' AND password ='$r_password'";
```
- The exploit uses the following payload:
```
username=-4731' OR (2708=2708)#
```
This payload is designed to always evaluate to true, bypassing the authentication check.
- The exploit leverages the fact that `stripslashes()` is not sufficient to prevent SQL injection.

This analysis provides more detail than a basic CVE description, outlining the vulnerable code, the specific exploit, and the impact of the attack.
