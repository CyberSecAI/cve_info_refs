## Description

Lets the admin add ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù or ‚Äúburied‚Äù css class to selected comments. Handy to highlight comments that add value to your post.

This plugin makes use of the meta\_query option added in WordPress 3.5 to the WP\_Comment\_Query class, so it is no longer compatible with earlier versions of WordPress.

Please report bugs and suggestions on [Github](https://github.com/pippinsplugins/Featured-Comments).
