## Description

This is a fork of cformsII, a highly customizable, flexible and powerful form builder plugin, covering a variety of use cases and features.

Oliver, the original author, discontinued developing the plugin. This fork is an effort to keep it up to date.

If you want to use plugin versions older than 14.6.3, you should rename the directory containing the plugin from “cforms2” to “cforms”. But bear in mind that old versions should not be used in public systems, because they contain [known serious vulnerabilities](https://wpvulndb.com/plugins/cforms) that are exploited in the wild.

The [current security baseline version](https://wpvulndb.com/plugins/cforms2) is 15.0.7.

### Related Plugins

[Really Simple CAPTCHA for cformsII](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cforms2-really-simple-captcha) provides an image CAPTCHA via cformsII’s pluggable CAPTCHA facility. To convert the old CAPTCHA fields to Really Simple CAPTCHA, please install the current version and activate the plugin.

[Contact Form DB](https://cfdbplugin.com) has support for storing and exporting cformsII’s submission data. Be sure to enable CFDB’s capture submission support for cformsII.

[Old Tracking DB for cformsII](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cforms2-old-tracking-db) is for those who do not want to switch from the built-in Tracking DB to CFDB. However it does not have any web interface.

[ReCaptcha Integration for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-recaptcha-integration) provides a reCAPTCHA implementation for cformsII.

### Localization

You can see the available languages and contribute via [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/cforms2). Only some of them that are almost completely translated are installed automatically.

If you want to install another language, please choose its cell in the Development column, export it as Machine Object Message Catalog (.mo) and put it in the wp-content/languages/plugins directory.

### Roadmap

Some things are to be done:

* add a Gutenberg equivalent of the editor plugin
* filter user input better
* rework multi-part forms to be independent from PHP sessions
* refactoring with object oriented approach
* long term: unit tests and continuous integration

## Installation

#### Installing the plugin

You can install the plugin via WordPress Dashboard. It should show up by searching for cforms2. If this does not work for you, there should be an option to upload a zip file, which is available on the [wordpress.org plugin directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cforms2/).

If you want to install manually, please upload the complete plugin folder “cforms2”, contained in the zip file, to your WordPress plugin directory!

If you want to check integrity of the download, please use the cforms2.\*.sig GPG signature files that are published via [GitHub releases](https://github.com/bgermann/cforms2/releases). The [key used for signing](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/D9426F9637DCA799FF0F9AF22626D16964438E53) has the fingerprint `D942 6F96 37DC A799 FF0F 9AF2 2626 D169 6443 8E53`. The git tags themselves are also signed beginning with version 14.8.

#### Upgrading the plugin

If you want to upgrade from the original cformsII from deliciousdays.com, please upgrade to [version 14.6.0.5](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/cforms2/assets/cforms2.14.6.0.5.zip) first, make sure you upgraded your settings (resave your global settings and every form) and [backup your database](https://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_Database). Then deactivate the original plugin. If you want to migrate your tracking database to CFDB, please install version 14.14 and migrate it. Then you can install the current version of this fork.

The form inclusion does not work with HTML comments (`<!--cforms name="..."-->`) anymore. You have to use shortcodes [cforms name=”…”] now. Please change the form calls accordingly.

If you want to delete the 14.6.0.5 version by deleting directory “cforms” and you have any cforms-uploaded files, make sure you do not delete your attachments directory, which is contained in the cforms directory by default.

#### Custom theme (CSS) files

Create a folder in your WordPress plugins directory and call it “cforms-custom”. Move all your custom theme files into it. This folder will protect your changes going forward.

Check out the [cforms CSS Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20220516192303/https%3A//www.deliciousdays.com/download/cforms-css-guide.pdf) on layout customization.

## FAQ

### Why do I not get any emails from my form?

Most probably this is not cformsII’s fault. Please check your WordPress mail configuration with a plugin like [Check Email](https://wordpress.org/plugins/check-email/). If that reports not to work, you don’t have a mail server running or its settings are broken. Please fix it yourself, tell your hosting provider or use an external SMTP plugin (see the next question).

### Where are the external SMTP settings?

That function was removed. The WordPress function [wp\_mail](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_mail) is used for mails now, which makes use of built-in PHPMailer by default. If you want to configure it to use an external SMTP server, use an appropriate plugin, e.g. [WP Mail SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/).

If wp\_mail is replaced by some plugin, multipart/alternative emails may not be sent properly, which is the case with e.g. Postman SMTP Mailer/Email Log.

### Why is the Form Settings page broken?

This is an incompatibility with WordPress 4.2+ that was fixed with cformsII 14.9.3. Be sure to use a current version.

### How can I contribute code?

Please use [GitHub pull requests](https://github.com/bgermann/cforms2/pulls).

### Where are comment and Tell-a-Friend fields?

These features were removed with version 14.12.

### Where is my database view?

This feature was removed with version 15.0.

### Does cformsII expose an API?

cformsII can be extended via WordPress actions and filters. You find their ‘cforms2\_’ prefixed names and inline documentation at the apply\_filters and do\_action calls. Additionally there is one API function that you can call directly: insert\_cform. Please have a look at its PHPDoc. Older cformsII versions had an API called my-functions, but that is removed as of version 14.14.

Although a lot of features had to be removed, this still is a great and easy to use form-plugin. Thank you for keeping it alive!

Hi! This is the most customizable and quick form plugin ever! Great thanks to its authors and developers! Additional gratitude for quick support! Wish all the best! I’m sure it is unfairly low number of installations, that must be millions!

New versions are worst. For first – can’t restore to txt and load in other project. Why?? Old version (Cform) could do it. Second – troubles with sending emails. Old version could include SMTP data, now need third-part plugin. Third – troubles with captcha. New version need third-part plugin.
Then problems in generating html, now option “select” generate to frontend classical “select” (display:none) and (i don’t know why) active ul-li structure…
I’m really crazy about it.
