Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2875 (Note: The provided text mentions CVE-2014-2875 and not CVE-2014-10399, thus the analysis will focus on the information provided for CVE-2014-2875. It appears there might have been a mixup in the CVE ID.)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the predictable and insufficiently random session ID generation within the `session.lua` library of CGILua. Different versions have different weaknesses:
  - **CGILua 5.2 alpha:** Generates session IDs based on OS time, resulting in easily guessable 9-digit (sometimes shorter) IDs.
  - **CGILua 5.1.x:** Contains a bug causing it to always generate the same session ID.
  - **CGILua 5.0.x:** Generates sequential 8-digit session IDs, making them easily predictable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Session IDs:** The core issue is the lack of strong randomness in session ID generation. This allows attackers to predict or brute-force session IDs.
- **Insufficient Entropy:** The IDs generated lack sufficient entropy to be considered cryptographically secure, especially in 5.0.x and 5.2 alpha versions, relying on easily guessed OS time or sequential numbers.
- **Bug in 5.1.x:** The constant session ID generation in version 5.1.x is a critical flaw making session management non-functional.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can easily guess valid session IDs, enabling them to take over legitimate user sessions.
- **Unauthorized Access:** By hijacking sessions, attackers can gain access to user accounts and perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Data Breach:** Access to user sessions could lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely since it relates to the generation of session identifiers used in web applications.
- **Brute-force:** The weak session IDs can be easily guessed using brute-force methods because of the low entropy and predictable patterns.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to communicate with the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of Session ID Generation:** Although the source code is available on GitHub making the generation mechanism known, it may be considered a knowledge-based attack where knowledge of the ID generation methodology is required.
- **Ability to send requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web application to test potential session IDs.

**Additional Information:**

- The maintainer of CGILua did not consider this a security risk and was unresponsive to reports and recommendations.
- The advisory recommends that users stop using CGILua's `session.lua` library and manually patch it using more secure libraries for session ID generation (e.g., `luuid`).
- The issue was introduced in CGILua 5.0 beta; earlier versions are not affected because they do not include the `session.lua` library.
- The vulnerability was discovered on March 27, 2014, and publicly disclosed on April 30, 2014, after the maintainer remained unresponsive.
