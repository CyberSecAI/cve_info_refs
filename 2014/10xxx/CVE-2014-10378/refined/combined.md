## Description

This plugin allows users to clone posts of any type, or copy them to new drafts for further editing.

How it works:

1. In ‚ÄòEdit Posts‚Äô/‚ÄôEdit Pages‚Äô, you can click on ‚ÄòClone‚Äô link below the post/page title: this will immediately create a copy and return to the list.
2. In ‚ÄòEdit Posts‚Äô/‚ÄôEdit Pages‚Äô, you can select one or more items, then choose ‚ÄòClone‚Äô in the ‚ÄòBulk Actions‚Äô dropdown to copy them all at once.
3. In ‚ÄòEdit Posts‚Äô/‚ÄôEdit Pages‚Äô, you can click on ‚ÄòNew Draft‚Äô link below the post/page title.
4. On the post edit screen, you can click on ‚ÄòCopy to a new draft‚Äô above ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù/‚ÄùMove to trash‚Äù or in the admin bar.
5. While viewing a post as a logged in user, you can click on ‚ÄòCopy to a new draft‚Äô in the admin bar.

3, 4 and 5 will lead to the edit page for the new draft: change what you want, click on ‚ÄòPublish‚Äô and you‚Äôre done.

There is also a **template tag**, so you can put it in your templates and clone your posts/pages from the front-end. Clicking on the link will lead you to the edit page for the new draft, just like the admin bar link.

Duplicate Post has many useful settings to customize its behavior and restrict its use to certain roles or post types. Check out the extensive documentation on [yoast.com](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/duplicate-post/) and our [developer docs](https://developer.yoast.com/duplicate-post/overview/).

### Contribute

## Installation

Use WordPress‚Äô Add New Plugin feature, searching ‚ÄúDuplicate Post‚Äù, or download the archive and:

1. Unzip the archive on your computer
2. Upload `duplicate-post` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress
4. Go to Settings -> Duplicate Post and customize behaviour as needed

## FAQ

### The plugin doesn‚Äôt work, why?

First, check your version of WordPress: the plugin is not supposed to work on old versions anymore. Make sure also to upgrade to the last version of the plugin!

Then try to deactivate and re-activate it, some user have reported that this fixes some problems.

Pay also attention to the ‚ÄúPermissions‚Äù tab in the Settings: make sure the plugin is enabled for the desired roles and post types.

If it still doesn‚Äôt work, maybe there is some kind of conflict with other plugins: feel free [to write in the forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/duplicate-post) and we‚Äôll try to discover a solution (it will be *really* helpful if you try to deactivate all your other plugins one by one to see which one conflicts with mine‚Ä¶ But do it only if you know what you‚Äôre doing, I will not be responsible of any problem you may experience).

### The plugin is not translated in my language!

From version 3.0 the plugin‚Äôs translations are managed by the WordPress.org platform and the plugin is shipped without language files, so first of all update translations under Dashboard->Updates.

If Duplicate Post is still in English, or if there are some untranslated strings, you can [help translating to your language](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/duplicate-post): you only need a WordPress.org account.

My plugin offers portfolio pages in addition to posts and pages. This plugin does not offer duplication option from portfolio pages. Although it appears to work for posts and pages.

This plugin is very easy to use and extremely useful. I can‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs not included in the WordPress basic functions.
