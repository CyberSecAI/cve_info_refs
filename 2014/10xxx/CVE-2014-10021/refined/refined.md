- Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Upload
- Root cause: The file upload function located on `/wp-symposium/server/file_upload_form.php` is protected, but `/wp-symposium/server/php/index.php` is not, and `/wp-symposium/server/php/UploadHandler.php` allows any extension. The same vulnerable files are located in `/wp-symposium/mobile-files/server/php/`.
- Attack vector: By uploading a file with an arbitrary extension (e.g., a PHP shell) to the unprotected `/wp-symposium/server/php/index.php` or `/wp-symposium/mobile-files/server/php/` directory.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Required attacker capabilities: Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, knowledge of the vulnerable path.
