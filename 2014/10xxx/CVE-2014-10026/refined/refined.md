The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in D-Link DAP-1360: Information Leakage (IL) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Information Leakage (WASC-13):**

*   **Root Cause:** The device leaks sensitive information via a specific request without proper authorization.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of authorization checks for the `/index.cgi?v2=y&rq=4` request.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to device information such as IP, MAC, and other details.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires local access (LAN) or remote access via internet using an XSS vulnerability.  Requires a special cookie containing authentication information (`cookie_lang=1; client_login=admin; client_password=1`).

**Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (WASC-09):**

*   **Root Cause:** The device allows changes to its configuration via HTTP requests without proper CSRF protection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Absence of anti-CSRF tokens or other CSRF prevention mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can remotely change device settings, such as enabling/disabling Wi-Fi, modifying SSID, and other parameters, leading to denial of service or unauthorized access.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafting malicious HTTP requests and tricking an authenticated user into submitting them.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the victim user to be logged into the device's management interface.

**Affected Products:**
*   D-Link DAP-1360, Firmware 1.0.0 and potentially other versions.
*   Specifically, DAP-1360/B/D1B (f/w ver 1.x.x - 2.x.x) is vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
* D-Link has released a fix in firmware version 2.5.4 or later for the DAP-1360/A/E1A model. They also plan to release a firmware fix for the DAP-1360/B/D1B model in November.
