Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-10035:

**Root Cause:**

-   The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the couponPHP CMS version 1.0, specifically in the `comments_paginate.php`, `stores_paginate.php`, and `admin/index.php` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **SQL Injection:**
    *   The parameters `iDisplayLength` and `iDisplayStart` in `comments_paginate.php` and `stores_paginate.php` are not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection.
2.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   The parameter `sEcho` in `comments_paginate.php` and `stores_paginate.php` is vulnerable to reflected XSS.
    *   Several parameters in the `/admin/index.php` script are vulnerable to stored XSS. These include `affiliate_url`, `description`, `domain`, `seo[description]`, `seo[heading]`, `seo[title]`, `seo[keywords]`, `setting[logo]`, `setting[perpage]`, and `setting[sitename]`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** Attackers can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Exposure of sensitive information stored in the database.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Complete compromise of the database server.
2.  **XSS:**
    *   Attackers can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session.
    *   This could lead to:
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Redirection to malicious sites.
        *   Defacement of the website.
        *   Theft of sensitive user data.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SQL Injection:** By sending crafted GET requests to `comments_paginate.php` and `stores_paginate.php` with malicious values for `iDisplayLength` and `iDisplayStart`.
2.  **XSS:**
    *   **Reflected XSS:** By sending crafted GET requests to `comments_paginate.php` and `stores_paginate.php` with malicious values for `sEcho`.
    *   **Stored XSS:** By submitting malicious input via POST requests to the `/admin/index.php` script through various vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For SQL injection and reflected XSS, an attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   For stored XSS, the attacker needs to have access to the admin interface and the ability to submit data.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the reflected XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities. The stored XSS vulnerabilities are accessible only to attackers with admin access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the SQL injection vulnerabilities are exploitable "ONLY if the attacker had access to your admin area", which seems incorrect as the described exploitation method does not require authentication.
*   The vendor was contacted and released version 1.2.0 to address these issues.
*   The vulnerabilities were discovered on 01.02.2014.
*   The vulnerability is present in couponPHP CMS version 1.0.
*   The exploit details provide specific examples of the vulnerable parameters and how to exploit them.

In summary, the provided content details both SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities in couponPHP CMS 1.0 due to insufficient input sanitization. These vulnerabilities could lead to significant impact, including data exposure, data manipulation, and malicious script execution.
