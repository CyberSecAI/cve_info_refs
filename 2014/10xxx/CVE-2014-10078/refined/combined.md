# [CVE- Requested][Vembu Storegrid - Multiple Critical Vulnerabilities]

---

*From*: Mike Antcliffe <mikeantcliffe () logicallysecure com>

*Date*: Mon, 4 Aug 2014 15:16:47 +0000

---

```
1. Advisory Overview

Multiple vulnerabilities exist in the Vembu Storegrid Backup and Disaster Recovery solution affecting both the client
and server software (see Additional Information section) include but are not limited to reflected XSS, source
code/sensitive information disclosure, privilege escalation, remote code execution, Denial of Service, and poorly
implemented business logic in the client which can be leveraged to allow an unauthenticated user to exfiltrate full
disk backups from a target machine via a rogue server. This is a white-label product and may be labelled as something
else.

2. Advisory information

- - Public Release Date: 4/8/2014

- - Vendor notified: Yes 30/7/2014

- - CVE’s: requested 1/8/2014

- - Last Revised: 4/7/2014

- - Researchers: Mike Antcliffe and Ed Tredgett

- - Research Organisation: Logically Secure Ltd

- - Organisation Website: <https://www.logicallysecure.com>

3. Vulnerability Information

- - Vendor: Vembu

- - Affected Software:
    - Storegrid Backup and Disaster recovery solutions SP edition
      (Affects version 4.4.X and version 6.x Client and SP Server on multiple platforms)

- - Product Website: <https://www.vembu.com/products/bdr/>

- - Vulnerability Class: Multiple

- - Remotely Exploitable: Yes

- - Locally Exploitable: Yes

- - Authentication Required: No

- - Indicator of network presence: Ports 6060 and 6061 accept HTTP/S connections.

4. Vendor Solution

None, however Issues may be addressed in version 6.2 (vendor reviewing the feasibility of a patch)

5. Additional Information.

The main vulnerability takes advantage of the client enrolment procedure. In it’s default state it is possible for an
unauthenticated attacker to register a client to a rogue backup server. During this enrolment phase a new admin user is
automatically created on the client using the attacker specified credentials, the attacker can then bounce through
their rogue server using the cln=<ip/hostname> get parameter which invokes request forwarding functionality allowing
access the remote client interface. From here they can schedule their own backups to their server and specify their own
encryption keys. These backups can then be restored to an attacker controlled virtual machine allowing the attacker
full access to whatever has been taken. It is also possible to backup a directory containing a toolbox of malicious
scripts and executables from the attacker controlled virtual machine and restore these to a target machine. We found an
option in the client web interface which allows a user to disable the ability to enrol new servers but were able to
bypass this using common attack vectors.

The backup functionality also allows the user to execute commands as part of the backup process by default these run
with system level privs. We have successfully gained system level remote shells using this method. From there we were
able to manipulate the web console to hide all traces of our exploits from the regular user, kill AV, drop the
firewall, access the registry, dump password hashes and finally screw up the machine (by deleting arbitrary system
files) so it wouldn’t boot and needed restoring (thus removing traces of our activity).

The whole process could easily be automated to target an entire subnet.

In addition to the above mentioned issue we discovered reflected XSS vulnerabilities, Source code disclosure via
incorrect processing of trailing slash (eg <http://clientip/index.php/>), Denial of Service via unhandled exceptions in
the client, Local privilege escalation, insecure storage of credentials (MD5), poor mysql implementation (default root
user configured with a simple password), and several others.

Note: We first discovered the vulnerabilities whilst testing a corporate network with around 60 active installs of the
client software ranging from domain controllers to HR machines, and client laptops containing personal data. We were
able to siphon off any data we liked. The client supports our decision to go public now they have removed the software.

We will be providing a full writeup as well as examples on our website shortly.

Note2: This software is white-label and is commonly distributed under many names.

Note3: According to the vendor they have a network of over 3000+ partners holding over 25PB of critical data.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
