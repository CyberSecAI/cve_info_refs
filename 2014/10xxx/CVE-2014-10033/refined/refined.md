```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to the direct concatenation of the `zID` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization in the `geo_zones.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data, such as administrator usernames and passwords, from the database. In conjunction with XSS, it could lead to more dangerous remote attacks, like stealing admin credentials and sending them to a malicious server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `zID` GET parameter in the `geo_zones.php` file. An authenticated admin account is required to exploit the vulnerability directly.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated admin account on the osCommerce instance. It is also mentioned that the vulnerability could be combined with XSS/CSRF for remote exploitation.
