  "CVE-2014-10077": {
    "description": "The `Hash#slice` method in `lib/i18n/core_ext/hash.rb` within the i18n gem before version 0.8.0 for Ruby is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This occurs when the method is called with a `keep_keys` argument that includes a key not present in the original hash, leading to an application crash.",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The `Hash#slice` method in the i18n gem does not properly handle cases where the provided `keep_keys` contains keys not present in the original hash.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
         "Denial of Service"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by triggering an application crash.",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specific request that causes the vulnerable code to be executed."
