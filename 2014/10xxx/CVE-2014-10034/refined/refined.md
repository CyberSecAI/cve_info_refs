Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-10034:

**Vulnerability:** Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause:**
*   **SQL Injection:**  Improper sanitization of user-supplied input passed through the `iDisplayLength` and `iDisplayStart` parameters in the `comments_paginate.php` and `stores_paginate.php` scripts. This allows for manipulation of SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Stored XSS:** Lack of proper sanitization of input provided via the `sEcho` parameter in `comments_paginate.php` and `stores_paginate.php` scripts.  Additionally, multiple parameters in the `/admin/index.php` script are vulnerable, including `affiliate_url`, `description`, `domain`, `seo[description]`, `seo[heading]`, `seo[title]`, `seo[keywords]`, `setting[logo]`, `setting[perpage]`, and `setting[sitename]`. These allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and script code that gets stored and executed within a user's browser session in the context of the affected site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Input validation failure. The application fails to sanitize user-controlled parameters before using them in SQL queries.
*  **Stored XSS:** Input validation failure. The application fails to sanitize user-controlled parameters before displaying them on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data within the database, modify data, or even potentially gain control over the database server.
*   **Stored XSS:**  An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the browser of other users who access the vulnerable pages. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities, in addition to being able to deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious GET requests with SQL injection payloads via the `iDisplayLength` and `iDisplayStart` parameters to vulnerable scripts.
*  **Stored XSS:** By injecting malicious payloads via GET requests through the `sEcho` parameter to vulnerable scripts. Alternatively, an attacker can inject malicious HTML/Javascript payloads via POST requests to `/admin/index.php` through the vulnerable parameters, which are then stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts and manipulate the query parameters.
*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   For the reflected XSS, the attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable scripts and manipulate the `sEcho` parameter.
    *   For the persistent XSS vulnerabilities in the admin panel, the attacker needs to have access to the admin interface, which may require some level of authorization depending on the application's access controls.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit-db entry provides specific examples of vulnerable URLs and POST data for both SQL injection and XSS attacks.
*   The advisory from Zero Science Lab confirms that the vendor was contacted and has released a new version to address the issue.
*   The couponphp changelog confirms that version 1.2.0 addressed the security issues by "Fixing some non-critical security issues in the admin area...Patches SQL injection vulnerabilities in admin area."
