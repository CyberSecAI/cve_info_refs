Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-8132:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `ssh_packet_kexinit` function in `kex.c` of the libssh library.
- The error handling path within this function had a flaw, where dangling pointers could be left in the session's crypto structures (specifically `next_crypto->client_kex.methods` or `next_crypto->server_kex.methods`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Double Free:** The dangling pointers could lead to a double-free condition when a malicious `kexinit` packet is received.
- **Dangling Pointers:**  Pointers to freed memory weren't being nullified in error paths, allowing for potential use-after-free scenarios.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the libssh process due to the double-free, which can be used to mount a denial-of-service attack against a server or client using the vulnerable library.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by receiving a specially crafted `kexinit` packet over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a server or client using a vulnerable libssh library.
- **Crafted Packets:**  The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious `kexinit` packet that triggers the double-free in the vulnerable code path of the `ssh_packet_kexinit` function.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects libssh versions 0.5.x and 0.6.x before 0.6.4.
- The issue was discovered by a libssh developer, and there were no known exploits at the time of the initial reports.
- The fix involves ensuring that dangling pointers are properly nullified when errors occur within the `ssh_packet_kexinit` function.
- Various distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE and Mageia issued security updates to address this vulnerability by patching their versions of the `libssh` library.
