IBM® DB2® pureScale™ Feature for Enterprise Server Edition, V9.8, running on AIX or Linux is affected.

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the appropriate fix for this vulnerability.

**FIX:**

The fix for DB2 and DB2 Connect release V9.7 is in FP11, V10.1 is in V10.1 FP5 and V10.5 is in V10.5 FP6, available for download from Fix Central.

Customers running any vulnerable fixpack level of an affected Program, V9.8 can contact support to obtain a special build containing an interim fix for this issue. These special builds are available based on the most recent fixpack level for each impacted release: DB2 V9.8 FP5. They can be applied to any affected fixpack level of the appropriate release to remediate this vulnerability. Additionally fixes based on DB2 V9.7 FP10, DB2 V10.1 FP4 or V10.5 FP5 will be made available on request.

Refer to the folowing chart to determine how to proceed to obtain a needed fixpack or special build.

| **Release** | **Fixed in fix pack** | **APAR** | **Download URL** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| V9.7 | FP11 | [IT06356](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT06356) | <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24040935> |
| V9.8 | TBD | [IT06355](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT06355) | Please contact technical support. |
| V10.1 | FP5 | [IT06354](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT06354) | <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24040170> |
| V10.5 | FP6 | [IT06353](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT06353) | <http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24040522> |

If you do not need to use DOCTYPE in XML statement, you can follow the step below to disable usage of DOCTYPE by setting the environment variable DB2\_XML\_DISALLOW\_DOCTYPE after applying the appropriate fix pack or special build.

As a user with DB2 SYSADM privilege, run the following commands:

db2set DB2\_XML\_DISALLOW\_DOCTYPE=YES

db2stop

db2start

Upon setting the environment variable, any usage of DOCTYPE in XML statement will return SQL16168N RC=11 SQLSTATE 2200M error.
