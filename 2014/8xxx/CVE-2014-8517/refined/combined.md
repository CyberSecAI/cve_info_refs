Abstract
========
A malicious http server can cause ftp(1) to execute arbitrary commands.
This vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2014-8517.
Technical Details
=================
If the ftp(1) program is used to act as http client and fetch data from
a website, and no output file is passed via the -o argument, the client
can be tricked into executing arbitrary commands.
When acting as http client, the ftp(1) program will follow http redirects,
and uses the part of the path after the last '/' from the last resource
it accesses as the output filename (as long as -o filename is not
specified).
After the output filename is resolved by the ftp client, if the rest
of the output filename begins with a '|', the output filename is
passed to popen(3).
Thus, a malicious web site could hide '|command' in a redirect and make
the client execute 'command' when ftp fetched that URL.

Solutions and Workarounds
=========================
Workaround: specifying an output filename by using "ftp -o "
circumvents the issue.
Solution:
Get a new ftp binary:
VERS being your NetBSD version
DATE being a build date past the fix date for your version
ARCH being your machine architecture
ftp -o /var/tmp/base.tgz http://nyftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/VERS/DATE/ARCH/binary/sets/base.tgz
cd /
tar xzpf /var/tmp/base.tgz ./usr/bin/ftp
or build a new ftp binary from source.
Affected file: src/usr.bin/ftp/fetch.c
Fixed versions:
HEAD 1.206
netbsd-7 1.205.4.1
netbsd-6 1.195.2.2
netbsd-6-1 1.195.8.1
netbsd-6-0 1.195.6.1
netbsd-5 1.185.6.3
netbsd-5-2 1.185.6.2.4.1
netbsd-5-1 1.185.14.1
Thanks To
=========
Thanks to Jared McNeill, who found the issue by code inspection, and
Christos Zoulas for changing ftp(1) to only use | commands for user
supplied names.

        This module exploits an arbitrary command execution vulnerability in
        tnftp's handling of the resolved output filename - called "savefile" in
        the source - from a requested resource.

        If tnftp is executed without the -o command-line option, it will resolve
        the output filename from the last component of the requested resource.

        If the output filename begins with a "|" character, tnftp will pass the
        fetched resource's output to the command directly following the "|"
        character through the use of the popen() function.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# ftp(1) can be made execute arbitrary commands by malicious webserver

*From*: Alistair Crooks <agc () netbsd org>

Hi,

Despite being old, tnftp(1) is quite widely used, hence this request.

Could we get a CVE issued for this one, please?

Sorry about the lack of warning, I wasn't aware of the issue before
the fixes were committed to the repo.

FreeBSD and Dragonfly have been informed, as has Apple, and I have
received a boilerplate reply from Apple.  The issue is present in
10.10 (Yosemite).

Thanks,
Alistair

Security Officer, NetBSD

Just a quick heads-up, and sorry that no notice was given - the issue
is that a malicious server can cause ftp(1) to execute arbitrary
commands:

   If you do "ftp [http://server/path/file.txt"](http://server/path/file.txt%22); and don't specify an output
   filename with -o, the ftp program can be tricked into executing
   arbitrary commands.

   The FTP client will follow HTTP redirects, and uses the part of the
   path after the last / from the last resource it accesses as the output
   filename (as long as -o is not specified).

   After it resolves the output filename, it checks to see if the output
   filename begins with a "|", and if so, passes the rest to
   popen(3): <http://nxr.netbsd.org/xref/src/usr.bin/ftp/fetch.c#1156>

   Here's a simple CGI script that causes ftp to execute "uname -a", the
   issue is present on both NetBSD 7.99.1 and OSX 10.10:

     a20$ pwd
     /var/www/cgi-bin
     a20$ ls -l
     total 4
     -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  159 Oct 14 02:02 redirect
     -rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  178 Oct 14 01:54 |uname -a
     a20$ cat redirect
     #!/bin/sh
     echo 'Status: 302 Found'
     echo 'Content-Type: text/html'
     echo 'Connection: keep-alive'
     echo 'Location: <http://192.168.2.19/cgi-bin/>|uname%20-a'
     echo
     a20$
   a20$ ftp <http://localhost/cgi-bin/redirect>
   Trying ::1:80 ...
   ftp: Can't connect to `::1:80': Connection refused
   Trying 127.0.0.1:80 ...
   Requesting <http://localhost/cgi-bin/redirect>
