      "root_cause": "Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey do not properly interpret Set-Cookie headers within responses that have a 407 (Proxy Authentication Required) status code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of Set-Cookie headers in 407 Proxy Authentication Required responses.",
        "Session fixation vulnerability."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote HTTP proxy servers can conduct session fixation attacks. An attacker could inject a cookie into the originally requested domain by providing a cookie name that corresponds to the session cookie of the origin server. This could lead to session fixation attacks, where an attacker can hijack a legitimate user's session. This attack only allows the attacker to write cookies, not read them.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attack via a malicious HTTP proxy server."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to act as a proxy server and intercept the HTTP request and response. The user needs to be configured to use the malicious proxy.",
       "additional_information": "Some sources detail the vulnerability more completely: the attack is triggered when a proxy returns a 407 Proxy Authentication Required response including a Set-Cookie header; the vulnerability allows the proxy server to inject cookies into the originally requested domain, which can be used for session fixation attacks.",
	  "note": "The information provided is consistent across multiple sources. Some provide more technical details."
