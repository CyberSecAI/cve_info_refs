Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-8791:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `register.php` script of Tuleap, where user-supplied data from the "data" request parameter is passed to the `unserialize()` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects through the serialized data. This is a classic PHP object injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a specially crafted serialized object, an attacker can trigger the destructor method of a class (specifically mentioned is Jabbex class) to achieve arbitrary PHP code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the HTTP request parameter named "data" in the `/src/www/project/register.php` script.
- An attacker must send a malicious serialized PHP object as the value of the "data" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated.
- The "sys_create_project_in_one_step" option of Tuleap must be disabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected versions are Tuleap 7.6-4 and prior.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 7.7.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Egidio Romano.
