| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Honeywell OPOS Suite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the HWOPOSSCANNER.ocx. The control does not check the length of an attacker-supplied string to the Open method before copying it into a fixed length buffer on the stack. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser process. |

## Honeywell OPOS suite Stack Buffer Overflow vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#659684

Original Release Date: 2014-12-12 | Last Revised: 2014-12-12

---

### Overview

The Honeywell OPOS (OLE for Retail Point-of-Sale (POS)) Suite is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow attack.

### Description

| The Honeywell OPOS Suite provides a standard programming interface that allows POS hardware to be easily integrated into retail POS systems based on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Honeywell OPOS Suite versions prior to version 1.13.4.15 are vulnerable to stack buffer overflows in HWOPOSScale.ocx and HWOPOSSCANNER.ocx.  In both HWOPOSScale.ocx and HWOPOSSCANNER.ocx, the controls do not check the length of an attacker-supplied string to the Open method before copying it into a fixed length buffer on the stack. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser process. These issues are being tracked by the Zero Day Initiative as [ZDI-CAN-2528](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-14-424/) and [ZDI-CAN-2527](http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-14-423/). These vulnerabilities affect the same component and are therefore jointly assigned CVE-2014-8269. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code in the context of the target user's browser process. The target user must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file from the attacker for this attack to occur. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The Honeywell OPOS Suite 1.13.4.15 addresses this vulnerability. Users may download [Honeywell OPOS Suite 1.13.4.15](http://www.honeywellaidc.com/forms/HSMDownloadForm.aspx?df=CatalogDocuments/Honeywell%20OPOS%20Suite_1_13_4_15.zip) from the Honeywell website. |
