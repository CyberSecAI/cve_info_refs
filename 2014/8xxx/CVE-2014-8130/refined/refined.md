    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in several tools distributed along with LibTIFF. A divide by zero vulnerability exists in the tiffdither tool.",
    "affected_component": "libtiff tiffdither tool",
    "root_cause": "A division by zero error occurs due to a malformed TIFF file. Specifically, the td->td_stripsperimage variable becomes 0, leading to a division by zero in the TIFFWriteScanline function within tif_write.c.",
    "vulnerability": "Divide by Zero",
    "impact": "Application crash",
    "attack_vector": "Processing a specially crafted TIFF file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to entice a user or application to process a malicious TIFF file.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs at line 119 of tif_write.c, where `(strip % td->td_stripsperimage) * td->td_rowsperstrip` is performed. When `td->td_stripsperimage` is zero, it leads to a division by zero error. The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted TIFF file that causes this specific condition. The issue is present in libtiff-tools version 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.1 and the last stable source release v4.0.3."
