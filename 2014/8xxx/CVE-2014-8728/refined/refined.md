Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in a SQL injection flaw within the `ranger_user[name]` parameter of the login page of Subex ROC Fraud Management System. Specifically, it is a blind-time based SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Blind-Time Based SQL Injection:** The application does not directly output the result of the SQL query, but the response time differs based on the query's outcome. This enables an attacker to infer information by observing response times.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `ranger_user[name]` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any unauthenticated user, removing the need for prior access to the system.

*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the backend database, such as usernames, password hashes, and other data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If the database user associated with the application has elevated privileges, the attacker might gain control over the entire Oracle server.
    *   **Application Access:**  By cracking password hashes, an attacker can gain access to the Subex ROC FMS application.

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/login/login` page.
    *   **`ranger_user[name]` Parameter:** The SQL injection is performed by inserting malicious SQL code into the `ranger_user[name]` POST parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Subex ROC FMS server.
    *   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
    *  **HTTP knowledge:** Attacker requires basic understanding of http requests.
    
**Additional Information:**
    * The provided exploit details a specific query to check if a user is a database administrator, which causes a 5-second delay if true. This is used to confirm the SQL injection and extract data using time-based queries.
    * The vulnerable application is identified as Subex ROC Fraud Management System version 7.4 (and possibly earlier versions).
    * The backend database is identified as Oracle.
    * The vulnerability was discovered in 2012 and patched soon after. The public disclosure was in 2014.
