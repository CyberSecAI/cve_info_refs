First, in general, when asking for a CVE assignment for an issue
"similar" to an existing CVE, it is very useful to provide an
additional statement or reference indicating why the issue should not
be mapped to the existing CVE. A difference in the product name does
not always require a separate CVE.

In this case, 1151307 is noted as similar to CVE-2014-6051.
CVE-2014-6051 is a frequently seen type of mistake (width * height
leads to integer overflow) and it's entirely plausible that this
mistake would occur independently in different codebases that have
related purposes.

Use CVE-2014-8240 for 1151307.

Also, 1151312 is noted as similar to CVE-2014-6052. CVE-2014-6052 is a
frequently seen type of mistake: essentially, there's a number that
can be sent in a manner compatible with a protocol specification, and
the number might even be sensible in an environment with huge
resources, but the number is used for a malloc argument without
checking whether malloc succeeds. (In other words, it's not
necessarily worthwhile to validate the number before calling malloc.)
It's entirely plausible that this mistake would occur independently in
different codebases that have related purposes.

Use CVE-2014-8241 for 1151312.

MITRE didn't try to find the specific vulnerable TigerVNC code in an
attempt to prove that that code wasn't a derivative of LibVNCServer.
We happened to notice a piece of code that may or may not be related
to CVE-2014-8241, and decided that it didn't look like a derivative.
Specifically:

  <https://github.com/TigerVNC/tigervnc/blob/d1a853bca7a70467915b3759aa9de5e63a5e8edb/vncviewer/X11PixelBuffer.cxx#L109>

    xim->data = (char*)malloc(xim->bytes_per_line * xim->height);
    if (!xim->data)
      throw rfb::Exception(_("Not enough memory for framebuffer"));

looks different from:

  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/85a778c0e45e87e35ee7199f1f25020648e8b812>

Hi,

I would want to get different CVE's assigned for tigervnc as it is
affected by similar flaws of libvncserver ( CVE-2014-6051 and
CVE-2014-6052 ).

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1151307>

# TigerVNC: Integer overflow — GLSA **201612-36**

An integer overflow in TigerVNC might allow remote attackers to
execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/tigervnc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2** |

### Background

TigerVNC is a high-performance VNC server/client.

### Description

TigerVNC is impacted by the same vulnerability as found in
CVE-2014-6051. An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer
overflow, was found in the way screen sizes were handled.

### Impact

A remote attacker, utilizing a malicious VNC server, could execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the client, or
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TigerVNC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tigervnc-1.4.2"

```
### References

* [CVE-2014-6051](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-6051)
