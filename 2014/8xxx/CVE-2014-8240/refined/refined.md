Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8240:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the way TigerVNC handles screen sizes. This overflow occurs when calculating the memory required to allocate a buffer for screen data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Integer Overflow: Multiplying width and height of the screen results in a value larger than what can be stored, which then results in a smaller number being used for allocation.
- Heap-based Buffer Overflow: Because the allocation size is smaller than required, subsequent operations that write to the buffer can write past the allocated memory region leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: A malicious VNC server can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the client running TigerVNC with the privileges of the user running the client application.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can cause the client application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious VNC Server: A remote attacker would need to control a VNC server to send crafted screen size parameters to the vulnerable client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a malicious VNC server.
- The attacker needs to have a vulnerable client connect to the malicious VNC server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2014-6051, which was found in `libvncserver`, and the same type of mistake leading to an integer overflow and buffer overflow.
- The fix involves ensuring proper handling of screen dimensions to prevent integer overflows during memory allocation for the framebuffer.
- The vulnerability was addressed in TigerVNC version 1.4.2 and later versions.
- Red Hat assigned the CVE to their bug tracking system under bug ID 1151307 and addressed it in RHSA-2015:2233.
