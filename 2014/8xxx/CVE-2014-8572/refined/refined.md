- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing input validation within the SSH handling logic.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can send a specially crafted SSH packet to the device after establishing an SSH connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the device and be able to establish an SSH connection. SSH must be enabled on the device.
