- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the `DoLogout` action in IBM Rational ClearQuest.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker could cause an authenticated user to be logged off without confirmation. This could result in loss of any unsaved data or work in progress. An attacker could also exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site scripting attacks and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to persuade an authenticated user to click on a malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click it. They do not need to be authenticated to the application.
