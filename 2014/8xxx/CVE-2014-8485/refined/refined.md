The first - binutils-2.24-corrupt-binaries.patch - fixes all of the bugs exposed by the test cases in that PR.  This patch has been applied to the Fedora binutils, and I would recommend that it be applied to the RHEL binutils.  The second patch - binutils-2.24-strings-default-all.patch - is a result of discussions on the binutils mailing list.  It changes the default behaviour of the strings program to be the \"-a\" command line option.  This makes strings scan the entire binary for text, not just loadable data sections.  This means that the BFD library is not used (to find those data sections) and so strings is less likely to trigger a memory fault.  On the other hand it also makes the output from strings more likely to contain garbage, from all of the code sections and headers.  I am not sure whether this second patch should be applied to RHEL.  It does change the default behaviour of a program and this might not be acceptable.  The second patch has been applied to Fedora rawhide and F21, although not F20.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157276#c9)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-11-26 14:32:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1157276#c14)  Nick Clifton    2015-06-29 11:59:27 UTC  ``` Suggested entry in the release notes:    The default behaviour of the strings program has changed.     Previously it would only display text found in loadable data    sections unless a command line option was used to specify    otherwise.  Now it will default to displaying text found    anywhere in the input file, unless a command line option is    used to restrict to data sections.    The change has been made because of security concerns.     In order to determine where the data sections are in a file,   it first has to be analysed.  If there are bugs in this    analysis code then they could be exploited by a specially    crafted input file and potentially used to gain access to    the system.  Scanning for strings anywhere in the input   file does not need any analysis, so it is the safer    default option.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1157276#c15)  Nick Clifton    2015-06-29 12:06:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1044338](attachment.cgi?id=1044338 \"Corrupt file that used to trigger a bug in the BFD library\") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1044338&action=edit \"Corrupt file that used to trigger a bug in the BFD library\") Corrupt file that used to trigger a bug in the BFD library  Note for QA:    This is the testcase for this BZ.
