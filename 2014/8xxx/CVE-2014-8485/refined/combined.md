The first - binutils-2.24-corrupt-binaries.patch - fixes all of the bugs exposed by the test cases in that PR.  This patch has been applied to the Fedora binutils, and I would recommend that it be applied to the RHEL binutils.  The second patch - binutils-2.24-strings-default-all.patch - is a result of discussions on the binutils mailing list.  It changes the default behaviour of the strings program to be the "-a" command line option.  This makes strings scan the entire binary for text, not just loadable data sections.  This means that the BFD library is not used (to find those data sections) and so strings is less likely to trigger a memory fault.  On the other hand it also makes the output from strings more likely to contain garbage, from all of the code sections and headers.  I am not sure whether this second patch should be applied to RHEL.  It does change the default behaviour of a program and this might not be acceptable.  The second patch has been applied to Fedora rawhide and F21, although not F20.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157276#c9)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-11-26 14:32:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle.

Previously it would only display text found in loadable data    sections unless a command line option was used to specify    otherwise.  Now it will default to displaying text found    anywhere in the input file, unless a command line option is    used to restrict to data sections.    The change has been made because of security concerns.     In order to determine where the data sections are in a file,   it first has to be analysed.  If there are bugs in this    analysis code then they could be exploited by a specially    crafted input file and potentially used to gain access to    the system.  Scanning for strings anywhere in the input   file does not need any analysis, so it is the safer    default option.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1157276#c15)  Nick Clifton    2015-06-29 12:06:36 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1044338](attachment.cgi?id=1044338 "Corrupt file that used to trigger a bug in the BFD library") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1044338&action=edit "Corrupt file that used to trigger a bug in the BFD library") Corrupt file that used to trigger a bug in the BFD library  Note for QA:    This is the testcase for this BZ.    Running "strings string-bfd-badfree" used to crash the strings program, but this should no longer happen.  This includes running strings with the "-d" command line option as well.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1157276#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-11-19 03:32:51 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:2079 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-2079.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: Re: strings / libbfd crasher

First, here are the two current CVE assignments for libbfd in GNU
binutils. More CVE assignments may occur later (in particular, see
below about versados.c). Affected programs apparently include strings
(on some but not all platforms) as well as objdump and nm. The readelf
program is not affected.

CVE-2014-8484 is for the incorrect decrements in cases of S-records
that are too short. References are:

  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17509>
  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/23/5>

The available information at the moment is that this is fixed in
binutils 2.25 (not yet available on the
<http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/> site), whereas new discoveries in
October 2014 might not all be fixed in 2.25. Regardless of the actual
content of 2.25, CVE-2014-8484 will remain a separate CVE.

<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/23/8> (i.e., the
five-byte S100\n file) is not, by itself, an attack that crosses
privilege boundaries in realistic circumstances, so this report is not
currently part of any CVE.

CVE-2014-8485 is for the current
<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17510> content, i.e.,
incorrect "--n_elt / ++idx" code that makes the attachment 7846 and
attachment 7848 attacks possible.

The much earlier research by Tavis Ormandy is already covered by
CVE-2005-1704. There is also CVE-2006-2362, which is an unrelated
discovery.

There is currently no CVE ID for the
psa-dont-run-strings-on-untrusted-files.html "0xdeadbabe October 25,
2014 7:20 PM" comment about "another one related with PE file headers
parsing." In general, a separate discovery that's potentially
exploitable for code execution could have its own CVE ID. Does anyone
want a CVE ID for that?

Similarly, there are currently no CVE IDs for the
<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16825> versados.c
report. Does anyone want that report covered in CVE? Depending on
exploitability, it would have approximately two CVE IDs.

# USN-2496-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

9 February 2015

Applications from GNU binutils could be made to crash, run programs,
or delete arbitrary files as your login if they opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [binutils](/security/cves?package=binutils) - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities

## Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup\_group function in libbfd in

GNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8485](/security/CVE-2014-8485))

Hanno Böck discovered that the \_bfd\_XXi\_swap\_aouthdr\_in function

in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8501](/security/CVE-2014-8501))

Hanno Böck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the

pe\_print\_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker

could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8502](/security/CVE-2014-8502))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal

vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft

input that could delete arbitrary files. ([CVE-2014-8737](/security/CVE-2014-8737))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered the \_bfd\_slurp\_extended\_name\_table

function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling

extended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to

craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8738](/security/CVE-2014-8738))

Hanno Böck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex\_scan

function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this

to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash). ([CVE-2014-8503](/security/CVE-2014-8503))

Michal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the

srec\_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could

use this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash); the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf

protection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8504](/security/CVE-2014-8504))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the srec\_scan function in libbfd

in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could

use this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04

LTS. ([CVE-2014-8484](/security/CVE-2014-8484))

Sang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the

\_objalloc\_alloc function and objalloc\_alloc macro in binutils. This

could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application

crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-3509](/security/CVE-2012-3509))

Alexander Cherepanov and Hanno Böck discovered multiple additional

out-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use

these to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may

be limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort)

by the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf protection.

The strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when

examining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not

originally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As

a defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to

default to 'strings --all' behavior, which does not use libbfd; use

the new argument to strings, '--data', to recreate the old behavior.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [PSA: don't run 'strings' on untrusted files (CVE-2014-8485)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/psa-dont-run-strings-on-untrusted-files.html)

Many shell users, and certainly most of the people working in computer forensics or other fields of information security, have a habit of running */usr/bin/strings* on binary files originating from the Internet. Their understanding is that the tool simply scans the file for runs of printable characters and dumps them to *stdout* - something that is very unlikely to put you at any risk.It is much less known that the Linux version of *strings* is an integral part of *[GNU binutils](http://www.gnu.org/s/binutils/)*, a suite of tools that specializes in the manipulation of several dozen executable formats using a bundled library called *[libbfd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_File_Descriptor_library)*. Other well-known utilities in that suite include *objdump* and *readelf*.Perhaps simply by the virtue of being a part of that bundle, the *strings* utility tries to leverage the common *libbfd* infrastructure to detect supported executable formats and "optimize" the process by extracting text only from specific sections of the file. Unfortunately, the underlying library can be hardly described as safe: a quick pass with *[afl](https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/)* (and probably with any other competent fuzzer) quickly reveals a range of troubling and likely exploitable out-of-bounds crashes due to very limited range checking, say:
```

$ wget [http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/strings-bfd-badptr2](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/strings-bfd-badptr)
...
$ strings strings-bfd-badptr2
Segmentation fault
...
strings[24479]: segfault at 4141416d ip 0807a4e7 sp bf80ca60 error 4 in strings[8048000+9a000]
...
      while (--n_elt != 0)
        if ((++idx)->shdr->bfd_section)                                ← Read from an attacker-controlled pointer
          elf_sec_group (idx->shdr->bfd_section) = shdr->bfd_section;  ← Write to an attacker-controlled pointer
...
(gdb) p idx->shdr
$1 = (Elf_Internal_Shdr *) 0x41414141

```
The 0x41414141 pointer being read and written by the code comes directly from that proof-of-concept file and can be freely modified by the attacker to try overwriting program control structures. Many Linux distributions ship *strings* without ASLR, making potential attacks easier and more reliable - a situation reminiscent of one of the recent bugs in *[bash](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/bash-bug-how-we-finally-cracked.html)*.Interestingly, the problems with the utility aren't exactly new; Tavis spotted the first signs of trouble some [nine years ago](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91398).In any case: the bottom line is that if you are used to running *strings* on random files, or depend on any *libbfd*-based tools for forensic purposes, you should probably change your habits. For *strings* specifically, invoking it with the *-a* parameter seems to inhibit the use of *libbfd*. Distro vendors may want to consider making the *-a* mode default, too.*PS. I actually had the libbfd fuzzing job running on [this thing](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/edison_fuzz/)!*

   Now, while `strings` is certainly the surprising tool, isn't this by extension infinitely more important for `objdump` which uses `libbfd` all over the place? I'd certainly think that the same group of people using `strings` for the described purpose use `objdump` for looking at disassembly, etc.

   Sure, although objdump is a more niche tool (chiefly for forensics / RE), so the audience is a lot smaller.

   I’d say if you’re actually using these tools to earn money, it is high time to go in and fix them. Also the linked bugs (nine years ago) is marked as fixed. Software has bugs. Free Software makes it possible for people who rely on it to fix the problems - especially when they rely on it for their profession. That’s part of the point of not making it non-commercial: To allow expert craftsmen to collaborate on improving their tools.

   As you said, this is an already known but silent issue. A common workaround is to use "strings -a" to entirely avoid using libbfd.

   Hi,
   I just made a test under slack64-14.1, freebsd64-10-P10, osx yosemite, and they all didn't report any problem.
   Output was always equal to:
   hello world
   .shstrtab
   .text
   .data
   AAAA

   but good to know =)

     At least on Slackware: strings is from util-linux; strings-GNU, from binutils crashes.

     Yup, gdb uses libbfd.

   Luca,
   this is clearly expected, since all these operating systems use BSD string (that does not link to libbfd) instead of GNU string. The bug is specific to libbfd, not to some operating system.

   Hey guys, do you wanna find something when fuzzing? Use as input the awesome
   radare2 regression tests https://github.com/radare/radare2-regressions.

   And for you Michał, thanks for all you're work! Keep on it, maquina!

     Probably not, since they try to do the bare minimum; but please test if in doubt.

    (sorry if this is a dup)

    I don't really care about the security implications, to me this is simply a mistake in strings. It is supposed to be a stupid utility, and in every case it is a disadvantage if it is smart. When I want a smart utility, I use objdump/nm/etc instead.

    The binutils maintainers are simply wrong, and a showing of community outrage is in order. Please send an irate email to binutils@sourceware.org. Thanks!

    A partial, but quick and simple remedy is to alias 'strings' to 'strings -a'. That is, add this line to .bashrc

     alias strings='strings -a'

    If you're using a recent release of the GNU binutils version of the strings command, this problem is already solved. It defaults to "-a", which scans the entire file and doesn't use the BFD library. This change was made in 2014 and first appeared in binutils 2.26.

    Here's the git commit:

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

Oracle Linux Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 19 January 2016
* 19 April 2016
* 19 July 2016
* 18 October 2016

# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Binutils, the worst of which
may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.25** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or overwrite arbitrary
files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.25"

```

### [PSA: don't run 'strings' on untrusted files (CVE-2014-8485)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/psa-dont-run-strings-on-untrusted-files.html)

Many shell users, and certainly most of the people working in computer forensics or other fields of information security, have a habit of running */usr/bin/strings* on binary files originating from the Internet. Their understanding is that the tool simply scans the file for runs of printable characters and dumps them to *stdout* - something that is very unlikely to put you at any risk.It is much less known that the Linux version of *strings* is an integral part of *[GNU binutils](http://www.gnu.org/s/binutils/)*, a suite of tools that specializes in the manipulation of several dozen executable formats using a bundled library called *[libbfd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_File_Descriptor_library)*. Other well-known utilities in that suite include *objdump* and *readelf*.Perhaps simply by the virtue of being a part of that bundle, the *strings* utility tries to leverage the common *libbfd* infrastructure to detect supported executable formats and "optimize" the process by extracting text only from specific sections of the file. Unfortunately, the underlying library can be hardly described as safe: a quick pass with *[afl](https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/)* (and probably with any other competent fuzzer) quickly reveals a range of troubling and likely exploitable out-of-bounds crashes due to very limited range checking, say:
```

$ wget [http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/strings-bfd-badptr2](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/strings-bfd-badptr)
...
$ strings strings-bfd-badptr2
Segmentation fault
...
strings[24479]: segfault at 4141416d ip 0807a4e7 sp bf80ca60 error 4 in strings[8048000+9a000]
...
      while (--n_elt != 0)
        if ((++idx)->shdr->bfd_section)                                ← Read from an attacker-controlled pointer
          elf_sec_group (idx->shdr->bfd_section) = shdr->bfd_section;  ← Write to an attacker-controlled pointer
...
(gdb) p idx->shdr
$1 = (Elf_Internal_Shdr *) 0x41414141

```
The 0x41414141 pointer being read and written by the code comes directly from that proof-of-concept file and can be freely modified by the attacker to try overwriting program control structures. Many Linux distributions ship *strings* without ASLR, making potential attacks easier and more reliable - a situation reminiscent of one of the recent bugs in *[bash](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/bash-bug-how-we-finally-cracked.html)*.Interestingly, the problems with the utility aren't exactly new; Tavis spotted the first signs of trouble some [nine years ago](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91398).In any case: the bottom line is that if you are used to running *strings* on random files, or depend on any *libbfd*-based tools for forensic purposes, you should probably change your habits. For *strings* specifically, invoking it with the *-a* parameter seems to inhibit the use of *libbfd*. Distro vendors may want to consider making the *-a* mode default, too.*PS. I actually had the libbfd fuzzing job running on [this thing](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/edison_fuzz/)!*

   Now, while `strings` is certainly the surprising tool, isn't this by extension infinitely more important for `objdump` which uses `libbfd` all over the place? I'd certainly think that the same group of people using `strings` for the described purpose use `objdump` for looking at disassembly, etc.

   Sure, although objdump is a more niche tool (chiefly for forensics / RE), so the audience is a lot smaller.

   I’d say if you’re actually using these tools to earn money, it is high time to go in and fix them. Also the linked bugs (nine years ago) is marked as fixed. Software has bugs. Free Software makes it possible for people who rely on it to fix the problems - especially when they rely on it for their profession. That’s part of the point of not making it non-commercial: To allow expert craftsmen to collaborate on improving their tools.

   As you said, this is an already known but silent issue. A common workaround is to use "strings -a" to entirely avoid using libbfd.

   Hi,
   I just made a test under slack64-14.1, freebsd64-10-P10, osx yosemite, and they all didn't report any problem.
   Output was always equal to:
   hello world
   .shstrtab
   .text
   .data
   AAAA

   but good to know =)

     At least on Slackware: strings is from util-linux; strings-GNU, from binutils crashes.

     Yup, gdb uses libbfd.

   Luca,
   this is clearly expected, since all these operating systems use BSD string (that does not link to libbfd) instead of GNU string. The bug is specific to libbfd, not to some operating system.

     Probably not, since they try to do the bare minimum; but please test if in doubt.

    (sorry if this is a dup)

    I don't really care about the security implications, to me this is simply a mistake in strings. It is supposed to be a stupid utility, and in every case it is a disadvantage if it is smart. When I want a smart utility, I use objdump/nm/etc instead.

    The binutils maintainers are simply wrong, and a showing of community outrage is in order. Please send an irate email to binutils@sourceware.org. Thanks!

    A partial, but quick and simple remedy is to alias 'strings' to 'strings -a'. That is, add this line to .bashrc

     alias strings='strings -a'

    If you're using a recent release of the GNU binutils version of the strings command, this problem is already solved. It defaults to "-a", which scans the entire file and doesn't use the BFD library. This change was made in 2014 and first appeared in binutils 2.26.

    Here's the git commit:
