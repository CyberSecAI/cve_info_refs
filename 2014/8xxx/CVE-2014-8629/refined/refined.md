Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8629:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for the "refr" parameter in the Pandora FMS page visualization agents.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application doesn't sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the "refr" parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the context of the victim user's browser.
- This can potentially lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the injected script in the "refr" parameter.
- The crafted URL must be visited by the victim.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious link containing the crafted XSS payload.
- The victim needs to click on the crafted link while logged into the vulnerable Pandora FMS instance.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable parameter: `refr`
- Vulnerable URL: `/index.php?sec=estado&sec2=operation/agentes/estado_agente&refr=`
- Example of malicious request:
`<http://firefly.artica.es/pandora_demo/index.php?sec=estado&sec2=operation/agentes/estado_agente&refr=</script><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>0&group_id=0>`

**Affected version:**
- Pandora FMS v5.1SP1 - RevisioÃÅn PC141031

**Remediation:**
- The solution involves implementing proper input validation of all user-provided data, particularly the 'refr' parameter, before using it in the web page context. This usually entails sanitizing or encoding the data to prevent the execution of malicious code.
