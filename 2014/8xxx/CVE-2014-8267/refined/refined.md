The provided content is related to CVE-2014-8267.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically in the handling of the RID parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker injects malicious script into the `RID` parameter. This malicious script is then reflected back to the user when the page is loaded, resulting in the execution of the script within the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `RID` parameter and trick a user into clicking the link or otherwise causing the crafted URL to be loaded by the victim's browser. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
