# Security Bulletin: Privilege Escalation and Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities in IBM® InfoSphere® Master Data Management Collaborative Edition (CVE-2014-8896, CVE-2014-8897, CVE-2014-8898, CVE-2014-8899)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Privilege Escalation vulnerability in IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition could allow an escalation of privilege attack. Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities in IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management - Collaborative Edition are caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker can use a specially crafted URL to run scripts in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website after the URL is clicked. An attacker can use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2014-8896](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8896)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Master Data Management Collaboration Server could allow an authenticated user to modify the authentication credentials of the administrator, which would give the attacker administrator access.

CVSS Base Score: 8.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/99049> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
