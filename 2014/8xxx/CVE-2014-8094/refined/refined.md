Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow when calculating memory needs for requests within the DRI2 extension, specifically in the `ProcDRI2GetBuffers()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code fails to properly validate the `count` field from a client request. When calculating the required buffer size, the multiplication can lead to an integer overflow. This results in a smaller than required buffer allocation.
*   **Out-of-bounds read/write:** After the integer overflow, when the allocated buffer is used to copy data from the request, out of bounds memory access occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds memory access can lead to a segmentation fault, crashing the X server.
*   **Memory Corruption:** It can result in memory corruption, which may be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted DRI2 request to the X server.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `ProcDRI2GetBuffers()` function which is part of the DRI2 extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to connect to the X server as a client.
*   A client must have authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted DRI2 request, specifically targeting the vulnerable function.
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the protocol and exploit mechanism.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The issue was introduced in `xorg-server-1.7.0` (2009).
*   The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of the `count` field within `ProcDRI2GetBuffers()`. The multiplication to calculate buffer size needs to use 64-bit integers to prevent the overflow.
*   The fix uses 64 bit integers to prevent overflow.
*   The issue was reported by Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive.
