Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incorrect library ordering during the linking of `sshd(8)` when compiled with Kerberos support on FreeBSD. The Heimdal libraries introduce the POSIX thread library as a dependency. This incorrect ordering can lead to symbols in the C library being shadowed by the POSIX thread library, causing incorrect resolution at runtime.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Library Linking:** The primary weakness is the flawed build process on FreeBSD where the `sshd(8)` binary is linked improperly when Kerberos support is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An incorrectly linked `sshd(8)` child process may deadlock when handling incoming connections. This can cause the connection to time out or be interrupted by the client, leaving the deadlocked `sshd(8)` child process behind. Eventually, the `sshd(8)` parent process will stop accepting new connections, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by repeatedly connecting to the SSH server (`sshd(8)`) and then dropping the connection after initiating, but not completing, the authentication process. This will lead to the described deadlock.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to connect to the vulnerable SSH server via the network.
*   **Ability to initiate and drop SSH connections:** The attacker needs to be able to establish and then terminate SSH connections before successful authentication in order to trigger the deadlock.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the FreeBSD build system and does not affect other operating systems or the version of OpenSSH available from the FreeBSD ports tree.
*   The vulnerability affects FreeBSD versions 9.1, 9.2, and 10.0.
*   Workarounds include rebuilding sshd with Kerberos support disabled or installing the `security/openssh-portable` package.
*   Patches are available to correct the issue by updating the system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release/security branch, or through binary or source code patches.
