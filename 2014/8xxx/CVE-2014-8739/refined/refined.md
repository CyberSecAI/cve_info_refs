Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **unrestricted file upload** flaw present in the `UploadHandler.php` file of the "Creative Contact Form" plugin (formerly known as "Sexy Contact Form") for both WordPress and Joomla platforms. This file uses the jQuery File Upload Plugin PHP Class 6.4.4, which contains the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type, size or content which enables uploading of arbitrary files, including malicious PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to:
    *   Full compromise of the web server.
    *   Data theft or modification.
    *   Deployment of further malware.
    *   Denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request containing the malicious file to the vulnerable `index.php` file located within the plugin's `fileupload` directory.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The malicious file is sent using `multipart/form-data` encoding, which allows the attacker to embed the file within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the web server hosting the vulnerable WordPress or Joomla installation.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication, meaning an attacker does not need any valid user accounts to perform an attack.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild starting as early as 2014-10-02.
*   The affected versions of the WordPress plugin are 0.9.7 and below, while the affected versions of the Joomla component are 2.0.0 and below.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves either removing the vulnerable feature entirely or implementing proper file validation.
*   A Metasploit module has been developed to facilitate exploitation of this vulnerability.
