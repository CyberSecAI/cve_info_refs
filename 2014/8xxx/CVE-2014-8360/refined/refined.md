{
  "CVE-2014-8360": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way GLPI's `getItemForItemtype()` function, in `inc/db.functions.php`, handles user-controlled parameters when instantiating objects. This function uses `class_exists`, which triggers registered autoload functions, leading to potential file inclusion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Unvalidated user input used in class instantiation leading to arbitrary local file inclusion.",
      "Insecure use of autoload functions allows loading of arbitrary local files by manipulating the class name passed to getItemForItemtype()."
     ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary local file inclusion. An attacker could include and execute arbitrary PHP files from the server by crafting a specific `itemtype` parameter.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious `itemtype` parameter in requests to specific GLPI pages (e.g., `ajax/common.tabs.php`), an attacker can trigger the vulnerable `getItemForItemtype` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable GLPI instance and knowledge of the local filesystem to include a malicious file.  The advisory mentions 'authenticated or not', implying that authentication may not be required."
