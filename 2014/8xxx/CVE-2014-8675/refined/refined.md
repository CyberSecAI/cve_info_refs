  "cve": "CVE-2014-8675",
  "description": "SOPlanning allows for an ICAL calendar to be shared/used elsewhere. However, the link is generated statically using authentication information. Sample generated link: http://localhost/export_ical.php?login=admin&hash=61b9bab17cdab06e759f2d11ee11afab An offline brute force attack can thus be conducted to find the user's password: hash = md5($user->login . '¤¤' . $user->password);",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application generates a static URL for sharing an ICAL calendar, embedding user login and a hash of the login and password.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication information disclosure",
	  "Insecure hash generation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can obtain the password hash of a user by accessing the statically generated URL. The attacker can then use this hash to conduct an offline brute-force attack to recover the user's password.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to obtain the statically generated URL, which is likely accessible publicly if the sharing feature is used. The attacker then uses the included hash and username in the URL for offline brute-force attack." ,
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the statically generated URL. They also need the ability to perform an offline brute-force attack on the disclosed hash."
