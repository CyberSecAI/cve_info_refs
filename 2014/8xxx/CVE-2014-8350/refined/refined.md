Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8350:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the failure of Smarty's secure mode to properly restrict the execution of PHP code embedded within `<script language="php">` tags in templates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Secure Mode Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass Smarty's secure mode, which is intended to prevent the execution of arbitrary PHP code.
- **Unrestricted Code Execution:**  The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary PHP code within templates despite the secure mode being enabled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker who can edit Smarty templates can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the PHP process, this could potentially lead to complete compromise of the system, data breaches, and other security risks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Template Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulation of Smarty templates.
- **Direct Template Editing:**  An attacker with the ability to directly edit Smarty template files can inject the malicious code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Template Access:** The attacker must have the ability to modify Smarty template files on the server. This could be achieved through compromised accounts, vulnerabilities in the application allowing template editing, or other means.
- **Knowledge of Smarty:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of Smarty templates to inject the exploit code correctly.

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a template contains `{literal}<{/literal}script language=php>...` tags.
-  Smarty versions prior to 3.1.21 incorrectly parse these tags and execute the enclosed PHP code even when secure mode is enabled.
- The provided example demonstrates how this can be exploited to execute a simple `echo 1+1;` statement, which would output "2" instead of displaying the script tags as plain text.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all Smarty3 versions in Debian prior to version 3.1.21.
- It affects users using Smarty in secure mode and exposing templates to untrusted third parties
- This vulnerability was fixed in Smarty version 3.1.21.
