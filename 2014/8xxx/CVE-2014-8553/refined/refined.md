  "CVE-2014-8553": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability lies in the `mci_account_get_array_by_id` function within the MantisBT SOAP API. This function returns user personal information without proper access control checks, which are implemented in the front-end, leading to information disclosure.",
    "Root cause": "The `mci_account_get_array_by_id` function, used by multiple SOAP API methods, retrieves user data (real name and email) without enforcing the necessary access level restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure",
      "Missing Access Control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthorized users can obtain personal information (real name, email addresses) of other users.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "SOAP API calls"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by invoking specific SOAP API methods (`mc_project_get_users`, `mc_issue_get`, `mc_filter_get_issues`, `mc_project_get_issues`) without proper authorization to access user personal information."
