  "CVE-2014-8097": {
    "description": "The X.Org security advisory describes multiple vulnerabilities in the X Window System servers. This specific vulnerability relates to the DBE (Double Buffering Extension) where the lengths in `ProcDbeSwapBuffers()` and `SProcDbeSwapBuffers()` calls are not validated. This can lead to out-of-bounds reads or memory corruption.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of length values in the `ProcDbeSwapBuffers()` and `SProcDbeSwapBuffers()` functions within the DBE extension of the X server. These functions use a 32-bit length value to read from a buffer, but the length is not checked to ensure it's within the bounds of the allocated memory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Out-of-bounds Read",
       "Memory Corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger out-of-bounds reads, potentially causing the X server to crash or return sensitive data in an X Error packet. Additionally, the `SProcDbeSwapBuffers()` function swaps data before passing it to the real proc, but it does not validate the length, which can lead to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious X client can send a crafted request to the X server that exploits the lack of length validation.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have an authenticated connection to the X server to exploit this vulnerability."
