Package        : sox
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8145
Debian Bug     : 773720

Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team dicovered two heap-based
buffer overflows in SoX, the Swiss Army knife of sound processing
programs. A specially crafted wav file could cause an application using
SoX to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 14.4.0-3+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# SoX: User-assisted execution of arbitrary code ‚Äî GLSA **201612-30**

Multiple heap overflows in SoX may allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-sound/sox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **14.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **14.4.2** |

### Background

SoX is a command line utility that can convert various formats of
computer audio files in to other formats.

### Description

A heap-based buffer overflow can be triggered when processing a
malicious NIST Sphere or WAV audio file.

### Impact

A remote attacker could coerce the victim to run SoX against their
malicious file. This may be leveraged by an attacker to gain control of
program execution with the privileges of the user.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All SoX users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-sound/sox-14.4.2"

```

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions.

These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

Package        : sox
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8145
Debian Bug     : 773720

Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team dicovered two heap-based
buffer overflows in SoX, the Swiss Army knife of sound processing
programs. A specially crafted wav file could cause an application using
SoX to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 14.4.0-3+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>
