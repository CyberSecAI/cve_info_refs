Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-8144

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the Doorkeeper gem's endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** Doorkeeper endpoints were vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially hijack a user's OAuth authorization code.
- This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources protected by the OAuth system.
- Any HTML document on the Internet could read a user's authorization code with arbitrary scope from a Doorkeeper-compatible Rails application where the user is logged in.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious HTML document that, when visited by a logged-in user, would initiate a request to the vulnerable Doorkeeper endpoint.
- This malicious request would be executed in the context of the user's session, allowing the attacker to potentially obtain the authorization code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject a malicious HTML document that a logged-in user will visit.
- The user must have an active session with a vulnerable Doorkeeper application.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or access to the server.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected versions of doorkeeper: 1.4.0 and earlier
- Fixed versions: 1.4.1 and 2.0.0
- There are no feasible workarounds, and the recommendation is to upgrade.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sergey Belov of DigitalOcean, reported and fixed by Phill Baker of DigitalOcean, and brought to the community's attention by Egor Homakov of Sakurity.com.
