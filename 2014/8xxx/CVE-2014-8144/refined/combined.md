# [CVE-2014-8144] CSRF vulnerability in doorkeeper

---

*From*: Tute Costa - thoughtbot <tute () thoughtbot com>

*Date*: Wed, 17 Dec 2014 13:29:17 -0500

---

```
Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in doorkeeper 1.4.0
and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the user's OAuth
autorization code. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
identifier CVE-2014-8144.

Versions Affected:  1.4.0 and below
Fixed Versions:     1.4.1, 2.0.0

Impact
------

Doorkeeper's endpoints didn't have CSRF protection. Any HTML document
on the Internet can then read a user's authorization code with
arbitrary scope from any Doorkeeper-compatible Rails app you are
logged in.

Releases
--------

The 1.4.1 and 2.0.0 releases are available at
<https://rubygems.org/gems/doorkeeper> and
<https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper>.

Upgrade Process
---------------

Upgrade doorkeeper version at least to 1.4.1.

Workarounds
-----------

There are no feasible workarounds for this vulnerability.

Credits
-------
Thanks to Sergey Belov of DigitalOcean for finding the vulnerability,
Phill Baker of DigitalOcean for reporting and fixing it, and to Egor
Homakov of Sakurity.com for raising awareness.

# Changelog

See <https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/wiki/Migration-from-old-versions> for
upgrade guides.

User-visible changes worth mentioning.

## master

* [#PR ID] Your PR description.

## 5.4.0

* [#1404] Make `Doorkeeper::Application#read_attribute_for_serialization` public.

## 5.4.0.rc2

* [#1371] Add `#as_json` method and attributes serialization restriction for Application model.
  Fixes information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2020-10187).

  **[IMPORTANT]** you need to re-implement `#as_json` method for Doorkeeper Application model
  if you previously used `#to_json` serialization with custom options or attributes or rely on
  JSON response from /oauth/applications.json or /oauth/authorized\_applications.json. This change
  is a breaking change which restricts serialized attributes to a very small set of columns.
* [#1395] Fix `NameError: uninitialized constant Doorkeeper::AccessToken` for Rake tasks.
* [#1397] Add `as: :doorkeeper_application` on Doorkeeper application form in order to support
  custom configured application model.
* [#1400] Correctly yield the application instance to `allow_grant_flow_for_client?` config
  option (fixes #1398).
* [#1402] Handle trying authorization with client credentials.

## 5.4.0.rc1

* [#1366] Sets expiry of token generated using `refresh_token` to that of original token. (Fixes #1364)
* [#1354] Add `authorize_resource_owner_for_client` option to authorize the calling user to access an application.
* [#1355] Allow to enable polymorphic Resource Owner association for Access Token & Grant
  models (`use_polymorphic_resource_owner` configuration option).

  **[IMPORTANT]** Review your custom patches or extensions for Doorkeeper internals if you
  have such - since now Doorkeeper passes Resource Owner instance to every objects and not
  just it's ID. See PR description for details.
* [#1356] Remove duplicated scopes from Access Tokens and Grants on attribute assignment.
* [#1357] Fix `Doorkeeper::OAuth::PreAuthorization#as_json` method causing
  `Stack level too deep` error with AMS (fix #1312).
* [#1358] Deprecate `active_record_options` configuration option.
* [#1359] Refactor Doorkeeper configuration options DSL to make it easy to reuse it
  in external extensions.
* [#1360] Increase `matching_token_for` lookup size to 10 000 and make it configurable.
* [#1371] Fix controllers to use valid classes in case Doorkeeper has custom models configured.
* [#1370] Fix revocation response for invalid token and unauthorized requests to conform with RFC 7009 (fixes #1362).

  **[IMPORTANT]** now fully according to RFC 7009 nobody can do a revocation request without `client_id`
  (for public clients) and `client_secret` (for private clients). Please update your apps to include that
  info in the revocation request payload.
* [#1373] Make Doorkeeper routes mapper reusable in extensions.
* [#1374] Revoke and issue client credentials token in a transaction with a row lock.
* [#1384] Add context object with auth/pre\_auth and issued\_token for authorization hooks.
* [#1387] Add `AccessToken#create_for` and use in `RefreshTokenRequest`.
* [#1392] Fix `enable_polymorphic_resource_owner` migration template to have proper index name.
* [#1393] Improve Applications #show page with more informative data on client secret and scopes.
* [#1394] Use Ruby `autoload` feature to load Doorkeeper files.

## 5.3.3

* [#1404] Backport: Make `Doorkeeper::Application#read_attribute_for_serialization` public.

## 5.3.2

* [#1371] Backport: add `#as_json` method and attributes serialization restriction for Application model.
  Fixes information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2020-10187).

## 5.3.1

* [#1360] Backport: Increase `matching_token_for` batch lookup size to 10 000 and make it configurable.

## 5.3.0

* [#1339] Validate Resource Owner in `PasswordAccessTokenRequest` against `nil` and `false` values.
* [#1341] Fix `refresh_token_revoked_on_use` with `hash_token_secrets` enabled.
* [#1343] Fix ruby 2.7 kwargs warning in InvalidTokenResponse.
* [#1345] Allow to set custom classes for Doorkeeper models, extract reusable AR mixins.
* [#1346] Refactor `Doorkeeper::Application#to_json` into convenient `#as_json` (fix #1344).
* [#1349] Fix `Doorkeeper::Application` AR associations using an incorrect foreign key name when using a custom class.
* [#1318] Make existing token revocation for client credentials optional and disable it by default.

  **[IMPORTANT]** This is a change compared to the behaviour of version 5.2.
  If you were relying on access tokens being revoked once the same client
  requested a new access token, reenable it with `revoke_previous_client_credentials_token` in Doorkeeper
  initialization file.

## 5.2.6

* [#1404] Backport: Make `Doorkeeper::Application#read_attribute_for_serialization` public.

## 5.2.5

* [#1371] Backport: add `#as_json` method and attributes serialization restriction for Application model.
  Fixes information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2020-10187).

## 5.2.4

* [#1360] Backport: Increase `matching_token_for` batch lookup size to 10 000 and make it configurable.

## 5.2.3

* [#1334] Remove `application_secret` flash helper and `redirect_to` keyword.
* [#1331] Move redirect\_uri\_validator to where it is used (`Application` model).
* [#1326] Move response\_type check in pre\_authorization to a method to be easily to override.
* [#1329] Fix `find_in_batches` order warning.

## 5.2.2

* [#1320] Call configured `authenticate_resource_owner` method once per request.
* [#1315] Allow generation of new secret with `Doorkeeper::Application#renew_secret`.
* [#1309] Allow `Doorkeeper::Application#to_json` to work without arguments.

## 5.2.1

* [#1308] Fix flash types for `api_only` mode (no flashes for `ActionController::API`).
* [#1306] Fix interpolation of `missing_param` I18n.

## 5.2.0

* [#1305] Make `Doorkeeper::ApplicationController` to inherit from `ActionController::API` in cases
  when `api_mode` enabled (fixes #1302).

## 5.2.0.rc3

* [#1298] Slice strong params so doesn't error with Rails forms.
* [#1300] Limiting access to attributes of pre\_authorization.
* [#1296] Adding client\_id to strong parameters.

  **[IMPORTANT]** `Doorkeeper::Server#client_via_uid` was removed.
* [#1293] Move ar specific redirect uri validator to ar orm directory.
* [#1288] Allow to pass attributes to the `Doorkeeper::OAuth::PreAuthorization#as_json` method to customize
  the PreAuthorization response.
* [#1286] Add ability to customize grant flows per application (OAuth client) (#1245 , #1207)
* [#1283] Allow to customize base class for `Doorkeeper::ApplicationMetalController` (new configuration
  option called `base_metal_controller` (fix #1273).
* [#1277] Prevent requested scope be empty on authorization request, handle and add description for invalid request.

## 5.2.0.rc2

* [#1270] Find matching tokens in batches for `reuse_access_token` option (fix #1193).
* [#1271] Reintroduce existing token revocation for client credentials.

  **[IMPORTANT]** If you rely on being able to fetch multiple access tokens from the same
  client using client credentials flow, you should skip to version 5.3, where this behaviour
  is deactivated by default.
* [#1269] Update initializer template documentation.
* [#1266] Use strong parameters within pre-authorization.
* [#1264] Add :before\_successful\_authorization and :after\_successful\_authorization hooks in TokensController
* [#1263] Response properly when introspection fails and fix configurations's user guide.

## 5.2.0.rc1

* [#1260], [#1262] Improve Token Introspection configuration option (access to tokens, client).
* [#1257] Add constraint configuration when using client authentication on introspection endpoint.
* [#1252] Returning `unauthorized` when the revocation of the token should not be performed due to wrong permissions.
* [#1249] Specify case sensitive uniqueness to remove Rails 6 deprecation message
* [#1248] Display the Application Secret in HTML after creating a new application even when `hash_application_secrets` is used.
* [#1248] Return the unhashed Application Secret in the JSON response after creating new application even when `hash_application_secrets` is used.
* [#1238] Better support for native app with support for custom scheme and localhost redirection.

## 5.1.2

* [#1404] Backport: Make `Doorkeeper::Application#read_attribute_for_serialization` public.

## 5.1.1

* [#1371] Backport: add `#as_json` method and attributes serialization restriction for Application model.
  Fixes information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2020-10187).

## 5.1.0

* [#1243] Add nil check operator in token checking at token introspection.
* [#1241] Explaining foreign key options for resource owner in a single place
* [#1237] Allow to set blank redirect URI if Doorkeeper configured to use redirect URI-less grant flows.
* [#1234] Fix `StaleRecordsCleaner` to properly work with big amount of records.
* [#1228] Allow to explicitly set non-expiring tokens in `custom_access_token_expires_in` configuration
  option using `Float::INIFINITY` return value.
* [#1224] Do not try to store token if not found by fallback hashing strategy.
* [#1223] Update Hound/Rubocop rules, correct Doorkeeper codebase to follow style-guides.
* [#1220] Drop Rails 4.2 & Ruby < 2.4 support.

## 5.1.0.rc2

* [#1208] Unify hashing implementation into secret storing strategies

  **[IMPORTANT]** If you have been using the master branch of doorkeeper with bcrypt in your Gemfile.lock,
  your application secrets have been hashed using BCrypt. To restore this behavior, use the initializer option
  `hash_application_secrets using: 'Doorkeeper::SecretStoring::BCrypt`.
* [#1216] Add nil check to `expires_at` method.
* [#1215] Fix deprecates for Rails 6.
* [#1214] Scopes field accepts array.
* [#1209] Fix tokens validation for Token Introspection request.
* [#1202] Use correct HTTP status codes for error responses.

  **[IMPORTANT]**: this change might break your application if you were relying on the previous
  401 status codes, this is now a 400 by default, or a 401 for `invalid_client` and `invalid_token` errors.
* [#1201] Fix custom TTL block `client` parameter to always be an `Doorkeeper::Application` instance.

  **[IMPORTANT]**: those who defined `custom_access_token_expires_in` configuration option need to check
  their block implementation: if you are using `oauth_client.application` to get `Doorkeeper::Application`
  instance, then you need to replace it with just `oauth_client`.
* [#1200] Increase default Doorkeeper access token value complexity (`urlsafe_base64` instead of just `hex`)
  matching RFC6749/RFC6750.

  **[IMPORTANT]**: this change have possible side-effects in case you have custom database constraints for
  access token value, application secrets, refresh tokens or you patched Doorkeeper models and introduced
  token value validations, or you are using database with case-insensitive WHERE clause like MySQL
  (you can face some collisions). Before this change access token value matched `[a-f0-9]` regex, and now
  it matches `[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]`. In case you have such restrictions and your don't use custom token generator
  please change configuration option `default_generator_method` to `:hex`.
* [#1195] Allow to customize Token Introspection response (fixes #1194).
* [#1189] Option to set `token_reuse_limit`.
* [#1191] Try to load bcrypt for hashing of application secrets, but add fallback.

## 5.1.0.rc1

* [#1188] Use `params` instead of `request.POST` in tokens controller (fixes #1183).
* [#1182] Fix loopback IP redirect URIs to conform with RFC8252, p. 7.3 (fixes #1170).
* [#1179] Authorization Code Grant Flow without client id returns invalid\_client error.
* [#1177] Allow to limit `scopes` for certain `grant_types`
* [#1176] Fix test factory support for `factory_bot_rails`
* [#1175] Internal refactor: use `scopes_string` inside `scopes`.
* [#1168] Allow optional hashing of tokens and secrets.
* [#1164] Fix error when `root_path` is not defined.
* [#1162] Fix `enforce_content_type` for requests without body.

## 5.0.3

* [#1371] Backport: add `#as_json` method and attributes serialization restriction for Application model.
  Fixes information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2020-10187).

## 5.0.2

* [#1158] Fix initializer template: change `handle_auth_errors` option
* [#1157] Remove redundant index from migration template.

## 5.0.1

* [#1154] Refactor `StaleRecordsCleaner` to be ORM agnostic.
* [#1152] Fix migration template: change resource owner data type from integer to Rails generic `references`
* [#1151] Fix Refresh Token strategy: add proper validation of client credentials both for Public & Private clients.
* [#1149] Fix for `URIChecker#valid_for_authorization?` false negative when query is blank, but `?` present.
* [#1140] Allow rendering custom errors from exceptions (issue #844). Originally opened as [#944].
* [#1138] Revert regression bug (check for token expiration in Authorizations controller so authorization
  triggers every time)

## 5.0.0

* [#1127] Change the token\_type initials of the Banner Token to uppercase to comply with the RFC6750 specification.

## 5.0.0.rc2

* [#1122] Fix AuthorizationsController#new error response to be in JSON format
* [#1119] Fix token revocation for OAuth apps using "implicit" grant flow
* [#1116] `AccessGrant`s will now be revoked along with `AccessToken`s when
  hitting the `AuthorizedApplicationController#destroy` route.
* [#1114] Make token info endpoint's attributes consistent with token creation
* [#1108] Simple formating of callback URLs when listing oauth applications
* [#1106] Restrict access to AdminController with 'Forbidden 403' if admin\_authenticator is not
  configured by developers.

## 5.0.0.rc1

* [#1103] Allow customizing use\_refresh\_token
* [#1089] Removed enable\_pkce\_without\_secret configuration option
* [#1102] Expiration time based on scopes
* [#1099] All the configuration variables in `Doorkeeper.configuration` now
  always return a non-nil value (`true` or `false`)
* [#1099] ORM / Query optimization: Do not revoke the refresh token if it is not enabled
  in `doorkeeper.rb`
* [#996] Expiration Time Base On Grant Type
* [#997] Allow PKCE authorization\_code flow as specified in RFC7636
* [#907] Fix lookup for matching tokens in certain edge-cases

  Rails applications (`api_only`)
* [#1045] Validate redirect\_uri as the native URI when making authorization code requests
* [#1048] Remove deprecated `Doorkeeper#configured?`, `Doorkeeper#database_installed?`, and
  `Doorkeeper#installed?` method
* [#1031] Allow public clients to authenticate without `client_secret`. Define an app as
  either public or private/confidential

## 2.0.1 - 2014-12-17

* [#525, #526, #527] Fix `ActiveRecord::NoDatabaseError` on gem load.

## 2.0.0 - 2014-12-16

### Backward incompatible changes

* [#448] Removes `doorkeeper_for` helper. Now we use
  `before_action :doorkeeper_authorize!`.
* [#469] Allow client applications to restrict the set of allowable scopes.
  Fixes #317. `oauth_applications` relation needs a new `scopes` string column,
  non nullable, which defaults to an empty string. To add the column run:

  ```
  rails generate doorkeeper:application_scopes

  ```

  If youâd rather do it by hand, your ActiveRecord migration should contain:

  ```
  add_column :oauth_applications, :scopes, :string, null: false, default: ââ
  ```

### Removed deprecations

* Removes `test_redirect_uri` option. It is now called `native_redirect_uri`.
* [#446] Removes `mount Doorkeeper::Engine`. Now we use `use_doorkeeper`.

### Others

* [#484] Performance improvement - avoid performing order\_by when not required.
* [#450] When password is invalid in Password Credentials Grant, Doorkeeper
  returned 'invalid\_resource\_owner' instead of 'invalid\_grant', as the spec
  declares. Fixes #444.
* [#452] Allows `revoked_at` to be set in the future, for future expiry.
  Rationale: [#452 (comment)](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/pull/452#issuecomment-51431459)
* [#480] For Implicit grant flow, access tokens can now be reused. Fixes #421.
* [#491] Reworks of @jasl's #454 and #478. ORM refactor that allows doorkeeper
  to be extended more easily with unsupported ORMs. It also marks the boundaries
  between shared model code and ORM specifics inside of the gem.
* [#496] Tests with Rails 4.2.
* [#489] Adds `force_ssl_in_redirect_uri` to force the usage of the HTTPS
  protocol in non-native redirect uris.
* [#516] SECURITY: Adds `protect_from_forgery` to `Doorkeeper::ApplicationController`
* [#518] Fix random failures in mongodb.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named âSecurity Product of the Yearâ by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmapÂ -vÂ -AÂ *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
