Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8627:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the negotiation process within PolarSSL 1.3.8. Specifically, when a server using PolarSSL 1.3.8 was establishing a TLS 1.2 connection, it could incorrectly select a weaker signature algorithm than what was actually available and supported by both the client and server. This was due to the selection of the lowest common denominator in the signature_algorithms extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect algorithm negotiation: The server was not selecting the strongest mutually supported signature algorithm.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Downgrade attack: By forcing a weaker signature algorithm, an attacker could potentially compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the communication channel. This is because weaker algorithms are typically more vulnerable to attacks and cryptanalysis. The vulnerability results in a server negotiating a weaker signature algorithm than available.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: An attacker positioned between the client and the server could manipulate the TLS handshake to force the server to use a weaker signature algorithm.
- Malicious client: A compromised client may intentionally offer only weaker signature algorithms, forcing a vulnerable server to comply.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the client and the server.
- Understanding of TLS handshake: The attacker must have an understanding of the TLS handshake protocol to manipulate it effectively.
