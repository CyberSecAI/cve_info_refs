Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper access control enforcement in Red Hat Satellite 6. Specifically, the application failed to verify that resources accessed via the API belonged to the organization to which the user was associated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control checks. The system did not adequately verify if a user was authorized to access a specific resource based on the organization it belonged to.
*   **API Access:** The vulnerability was exploitable via the application's API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** An attacker with API access and knowledge of resource names could access resources belonging to other organizations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Exploitation:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by directly interacting with the application's API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **API Access:** Attackers must have access to the Red Hat Satellite API.
*   **Knowledge of Resource Names:** Attackers need to know or guess the names of resources they wish to access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects models with a 'belongs\_to' association to an organization.
*   The issue was identified by Eric Helms of Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Satellite 6.3, as detailed in the RHSA-2018:0336 security advisory.
