Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "Dynamic Content Elements" (dce) TYPO3 extension automatically sends installation environment data to the extension author's infrastructure without requiring user consent or interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The extension transmits sensitive data about the TYPO3 installation environment. This data can potentially include details about the server, installed extensions, and other configuration settings.
- **Lack of User Consent:** The data transmission happens silently without the user's knowledge or explicit permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Violation:** The automatic data transmission infringes on the user's privacy by sharing their installation details without consent.
- **Potential Security Risk:** While the provided information doesn't explicitly state what data was being sent, the disclosure of installation environment data could potentially aid attackers in identifying vulnerable systems. However, the advisory only labels the severity as low.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by the extension itself. There is no specific external action that is required to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be in any specific position or possess any special capabilities. They are the developers of the extension and thus inherently in a position to receive the data. The vulnerability is caused by the design of the extension and not by any action or condition on the user's side.

**Additional Details:**
- The content provided gives more detail than the original CVE description by specifying the exact nature of the information disclosure vulnerability, i.e., the automatic transmission of installation environment data.
- The advisory indicates the problem was identified and fixed by version 0.11.5 of the extension, which introduced a configuration option to enable or disable this behaviour.
