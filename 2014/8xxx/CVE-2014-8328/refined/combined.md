# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2014-015: Information Disclosure vulnerability in Dynamic Content Elements (dce)

It has been discovered that the extension "Dynamic Content Elements" (dce) is susceptible to Information Disclosure.

**Release Date:** October 17, 2014

**Bulletin Update:** October 18, 2014 (added CVE)

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** all versions of 0.7.x, 0.8.x, 0.9.x, 0.10.x, 0.11.4 and below of 0.11.x

**Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure

**Severity:** Low

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C

**CVE:** CVE-2014-8328

**Problem Description:** The extension provides a functionality to check for extension updates. Along with this functionality, installation environment data is automatically reported to the infrastructure of the extension author without user interaction.

**Solution:** Updated version 0.11.5 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at [http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/dce/0.11.5/t3x/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/dce/0.11.5/t3x/ "Opens external link in new window"). The new extension version provides a configuration option to enable the described behaviour.

**Credits:** Credits go to Georg Ringer who discovered and reported the issue and Armin Vieweg who quickly responded & resolved this issue.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Initiates file download"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce "Opens external link in new window") to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.

For more details check the changelog in documentation. Thanks for using DCE :)  8 LTS 9 LTS | **8.7.0 - 9.5.99** | [**Download**](/extension/download/dce/2.1.0/zip "Size: 677kB") |
