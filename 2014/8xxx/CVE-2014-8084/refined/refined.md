Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8084:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw. It stems from the insecure handling of user-supplied input within the `ajax.php` script of Osclass. Specifically, the `ajaxfile` parameter, when handling a "custom" action, isn't properly sanitized before being used in a `require_once()` call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include arbitrary local files on the server.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** User-provided input (`ajaxfile` parameter) is not adequately validated, allowing for directory traversal.
- **Direct use of user input in `require_once()`:** The code directly uses the unsanitized `ajaxfile` parameter in a `require_once()` function, which leads to the LFI vulnerability.
- **Vulnerable code location:** The vulnerability is in `/oc-includes/osclass/controller/ajax.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary PHP code execution:** By including a local file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server, when the application is running on Windows.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files from the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP request:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HTTP request that includes the `ajaxfile` parameter with a path to a local file they wish to include.
- **AJAX interface:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application's AJAX interface handles a "custom" action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Osclass application.
- **Knowledge of file system:** Basic knowledge of the server's filesystem structure would be required to craft the malicious paths.
- **No authentication required:** There is no mention of any authentication bypass requirement in order to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Osclass version 3.4.2 and prior versions.
- The fix was implemented in Osclass version 3.4.3.
- The vulnerability is specifically exploitable on Windows servers.
- A partial mitigation against directory traversal is present (`stripos($file, '../') !== false`) but appears insufficient. Also, there is a check for '/admin/' to prevent accessing those files.
