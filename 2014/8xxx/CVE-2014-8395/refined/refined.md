Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2014-8395:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a DLL hijacking vulnerability that occurs when a file associated with Corel Painter 2015 is executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The application searches for the `wacommt.dll` file in the same directory as the opened document without validating the DLL's path.
- **DLL Hijacking:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL file with the same name (`wacommt.dll`) in the same directory as the document, and it will be loaded and executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Corel Painter 2015 application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local File System:** The attacker needs to place a malicious `wacommt.dll` file in the same directory as a legitimate Corel Painter 2015 document.
- **User Interaction:** The user must open the associated Corel Painter document to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have write access to the file system to place the malicious DLL.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious document.
- The Corel application should not be running before the associated file is executed.
