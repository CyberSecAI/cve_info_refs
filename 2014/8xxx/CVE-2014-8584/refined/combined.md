Hurray! A video player plugin that is non-complicated with a bunch of codes and customizations for so many things that it takes forever to search through documentation for (and still not find) a simple answer to a simple question!!!
Thank you!
And I love how the player looks! Very user-friendly and viewer-friendly!
Thank you, again!

I love that even the YouTube Videos from my Channel play seamlessly as if part of the entire Video Library.
