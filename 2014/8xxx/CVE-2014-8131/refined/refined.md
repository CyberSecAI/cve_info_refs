Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A logic bug exists in the `qemu` implementation of `virConnectGetAllDomainStats` when fine-grained ACLs are used to restrict user access to domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect lock management of domains. Specifically, after skipping a domain due to ACL restrictions, the next domain to be inspected may not be locked correctly.
- This incorrect locking could lead to a deadlock or a crash in `libvirtd`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A restricted client can trigger a denial of service (DoS) against a more privileged user.
- The `libvirtd` daemon can either deadlock trying to lock a domain incorrectly or crash when trying to unlock a domain that was not locked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when a client, with limited access due to fine-grained ACLs, uses `virConnectGetAllDomainStats`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a client connection to the `libvirtd` daemon.
- The attacker must have restricted access to domains due to fine-grained ACL configurations. They must be authorized to connect to libvirtd, but not necessarily to view all domains.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by commits `d1bde8eda3b4027b38c7c1d5942a6388b0458803` and `1f4831ee6ecc17d0f2008d7db15bfd9bc3b1d685`.
- The vulnerability was fixed by commits `57023c0a3af4af1c547189c1f6712ed5edeb0c0b` and `cb104ef734dfea12cb8826dba7e2c98912c4b7e1`.
- The vulnerability affects libvirt versions 1.2.8, 1.2.9, and 1.2.10 and was fixed in 1.2.11.
-  A workaround is to avoid using fine-grained access control mechanisms or avoid restricting the set of domains an authorized client can see.
