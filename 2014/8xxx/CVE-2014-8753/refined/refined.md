Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-8753:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Cit-e-Access web application, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Multiple XSS vulnerabilities are present within the Cit-e-Access Version 6 application. Specifically, the vulnerabilities are located in the following pages and parameters:
*   `/eventscalendar/index.cfm?` with the `&DID` parameter (HTTP GET)
*   `/search/index.cfm?` with the `&keyword` parameter (HTTP POST)
*   `/news/index.cfm` with the `&jump2` and `&DID` parameters (HTTP GET)
*   `eventscalendar?` with the `&TPID` parameter (HTTP GET)
*   `/meetings/index.cfm?` with the `&DID` parameter (HTTP GET)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application. This could potentially lead to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Defacement of the website
*   Redirection to malicious websites
*   Stealing of sensitive information (if other vulnerabilities exist)
*   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs (GET requests) or forms (POST requests) targeting vulnerable parameters in the Cit-e-Access application. An attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters to be executed by users of the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated (AV:N - Network Access).
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and forms, and trick users into accessing them.
*   The attacker would typically need to rely on social engineering or other methods to get users to click on the malicious link or submit the malicious form. (AC:M - Medium Access Complexity)

**Additional Notes**
*   The affected software is Cit-e-Access Version 6.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Wang Jing.
*   The vendor was notified but did not respond.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 (Medium).
*   The security-tracker.debian.org notes that this vulnerability is "NOT-FOR-US" indicating that it does not affect Debian packages.
