      "description": "The AMQP dissector could crash.",
      "root_cause": "The AMQP dissector in Wireshark has a vulnerability related to handling of 32-bit size fields, which can lead to overflows when using 32-bit arithmetic.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Integer overflow leading to a crash"
      ],
      "impact": "It may be possible to cause Wireshark to crash.",

        "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network.",
        "Convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to either be able to inject a malformed packet into network traffic being captured by Wireshark, or have a malformed packet capture file which a user can open in Wireshark",
        "details": "The AMQP dissector in Wireshark is vulnerable to a crash. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of 32-bit size fields, which can lead to overflows when using 32-bit arithmetic. This can be triggered by crafting a malformed AMQP packet or capture file which, when processed by Wireshark, results in a crash."
