Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `MatchPasswordData` function within the `DBEngine.dll` of FileMaker Pro. Specifically, the function uses a single bit in the `AL` register to indicate successful or failed authentication. The vulnerability stems from the fact that after calculating the password hash and comparing it, the function uses this single bit for authentication. By modifying this bit (forcing it to be 1) an attacker can bypass authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authentication bypass. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database by manipulating the authentication flag in memory.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** If the username is "Admin", the bypass leads to privilege escalation, granting full permissions on the database. This is due to the fact that bypassing authentication as admin gives you admin rights on the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored in FileMaker databases without valid credentials.
-   **Data Breach:** Confidential data stored within the database is at risk of exposure.
-   **Privilege Escalation (with 'Admin' username):** Attackers can gain full control over the database.
-   The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass any security measures implemented at the application level, because it operates at a lower layer.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the machine where FileMaker is installed because the attacker must change the value of a bit in memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system running the vulnerable FileMaker software.
-   **Ability to Modify Memory:** The attacker needs to be able to modify a single bit in the program's memory space, by using tools like a debugger, during runtime.
-   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific location and bit in memory to change to bypass authentication.

This vulnerability is described as a "obvious" one, which means that the vulnerability is present in an easily accessible way. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass all the security measures taken to protect data by exploiting this authentication bypass vulnerability.
