Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8393:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue in multiple Corel software products. When a file associated with a vulnerable Corel application is opened, the application searches for specific DLL files in the same directory as the document. This occurs because the application does not control the path from where these DLL files are loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The applications load DLLs from the document's directory without proper validation or a secure search path.
- **DLL Hijacking:** By placing a malicious DLL with the same name as a required DLL in the same directory as a Corel document, an attacker can force the application to load and execute the malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the vulnerable Corel application.
- **Complete System Compromise (potentially):** Depending on the privileges of the user running the application, the attacker could potentially gain significant control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability requires an attacker to have the ability to place a malicious DLL into a directory.
- **File Manipulation:** The attacker must craft a malicious DLL that has the same name as one of the vulnerable DLLs, and place it in the same directory as a Corel document.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open a file associated with the vulnerable Corel software for the malicious DLL to be loaded and executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **File system access:** The attacker needs to write files to the victim's file system.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable DLL names:** The attacker must know the names of the DLL files the vulnerable Corel software is looking for.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would likely need to socially engineer the user to open a document from an untrusted source.

**Specific Details for CVE-2014-8393:**

According to the provided text, CVE-2014-8393 specifically affects:
- CorelDRAW X7
- Corel Photo-Paint X7
- Corel PaintShop Pro X7
- Corel Painter 2015
- Corel PDF Fusion

These applications are vulnerable because they look for a DLL file called "wintab32.dll" in the same directory as the associated document, and don't validate the path, allowing for a DLL hijacking attack.
