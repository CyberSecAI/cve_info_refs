How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Corel Software DLL Hijacking

---

*From*: CORE Advisories Team <advisories () coresecurity com>

*Date*: Mon, 12 Jan 2015 13:28:26 -0300

---

```
Core Security - Corelabs Advisory
<http://corelabs.coresecurity.com/>

Corel Software DLL Hijacking

1. *Advisory Information*

Title: Corel Software DLL Hijacking
Advisory ID: CORE-2015-0001
Advisory URL:
<http://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/corel-software-dll-hijacking>
Date published: 2015-01-12
Date of last update: 2015-01-06
Vendors contacted: Corel
Release mode: User release

2. *Vulnerability Information*

Class: Uncontrolled Search Path Element [CWE-427]
Impact: Code execution
Remotely Exploitable: No
Locally Exploitable: Yes
CVE Name: CVE-2014-8393, CVE-2014-8394, CVE-2014-8395, CVE-2014-8396,
CVE-2014-8397, CVE-2014-8398

3. *Vulnerability Description*

Corel [1] has developed a wide range of products that includes graphics, painting,
photo, video and office software.(CorelDRAW,Corel Photo-Paint, Corel PaintShop Pro, Corel CAD,
Corel Painter, Corel PDF Fusion, Corel VideoStudio and Corel FastFlick among others)

When a file associated with the Corel software is opened, the directory of that document
is first used to locate DLLs, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands
by inserting malicious DLLs into the same directory as the document.

4. *Vulnerable packages*

   . Corel DRAW X7 [2]
   . Corel Photo-Paint X7 [3]
   . Corel PaintShop Pro X7 [7]
   . Corel CAD 2014 [4]
   . Corel Painter 2015 [5]
   . Corel PDF Fusion [6]
   . Corel VideoStudio PRO X7 [8]
   . Corel FastFlick [9]

Other versions could be affected too, but they were not checked.

5. *Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds*

Given that this is a client-side vulnerability, affected users should avoid opening untrusted
files whose extensions are associated with Corel software and contain any of the DLL files detailed below.

6. *Credits*

This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Marcos Accossatto from Core Security
Exploit Writers Team. The publication of this advisory was coordinated by Joaquin Rodriguez
Varela from Core Advisories Team.

7. *Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code*

[CVE-2014-8393] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file
associated with any of the following Corel applications is executed (CorelDRAW X7, Corel
 Photo-Paint X7, Corel PaintShop Pro X7, Corel Painter 2015 or Corel PDF Fusion). The
affected application should not be running for the vulnerability to work. The Corel
software looks for a DLL file called "wintab32.dll" and does not control its path, therefore
 allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with the same name inside the folder where the
associated file is. The DLL is executed within the context of the application.

[CVE-2014-8394] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file
associated with Corel CAD 2014 is executed. Corel CAD 2014 should not be running before
the associated file is executed for the vulnerability to work.
Corel CAD looks for a DLL file called "FxManagedCommands_3.08_9.tx" or "TD_Mgd_3.08_9.dll"
and does not control their path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with the
same name of either DLL inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is
executed within the context of the application.

[CVE-2014-8395] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with
Corel Painter 2015 is executed. Corel Painter 2015 should not be running before the associated
file is executed for the vulnerability to work. Corel Painter looks for a DLL file called
"wacommt.dll" and does not control its path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file
with the same name inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is executed within
the context of the application.

[CVE-2014-8396] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with
Corel PDF Fusion is executed. Corel PDF Fusion should not be running before the associated
file is executed for the vulnerability to work. Corel PDF Fusion looks for a DLL file called
"quserex.dll" and does not control its path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file
with the same name inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is executed within
the context of the application.

[CVE-2014-8397] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with
Corel VideoStudio PRO X7 or Corel FastFlix is executed. Corel Video Studio or Corel FastFlix
should not be running before the associated file is executed for the vulnerability to work.
Corel PDF Fusion looks for a DLL file called "u32ZLib.dll" and does not control its path,
therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with the same name inside the folder where the
associated file is. The DLL is executed within the context of the application.

[CVE-2014-8398] This vulnerability is caused by a DLL Hijacking when a file associated with
Corel FastFlick is executed. Corel FastFlick should not be running before the associated file
is executed for the vulnerability to work. Corel FastFlick looks for DLL files called "igfxcmrt32.dll",
"ipl.dll", "MSPStyleLib.dll", "uFioUtil.dll", "uhDSPlay.dll", "uipl.dll", "uvipl.dll", "VC1DecDll.dll" or
"VC1DecDll_SSE3.dll" and does not control their path, therefore allowing to copy a malicious DLL file with
the same name of any of those DLLs inside the folder where the associated file is. The DLL is executed
within the context of the application.

8. *Report Timeline*

. 2014-12-09:
Core Security notifies Corel of the vulnerabilities. Publication date is
set for January 5th, 2015.

. 2014-12-17:
Core Security requests an acknowledgement of the mail previously sent.
Informs that if no answer
is registered the advisory will be pubilshed as "user release".

. 2015-01-02:
Core Security tries to contact the vendor through their twitter account
without any luck.

. 2015-01-12:
Advisory CORE-2015-0001 published as user release.
