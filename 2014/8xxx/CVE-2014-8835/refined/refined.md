```
{
  "CVE-2014-8835": {
    "Root cause": "The sysmond daemon does not validate the type of the 'Attributes' key in the XPC request dictionary, which is expected to be of type xpc_data. Instead, it can be any XPC type. Specifically, an xpc_uuid type can be used to point to a controlled memory region, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local application exploiting a vulnerability in the sysmond daemon via XPC.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted XPC message to the sysmond daemon."
