{
  "CVE-2014-8100": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the X.org X server, which may lead to privilege escalation or denial of service. Specifically, the Render extension is vulnerable due to missing validation of lengths and offsets in requests. The affected functions are:  ProcRenderQueryVersion(), SProcRenderQueryVersion(), SProcRenderQueryPictFormats(), SProcRenderQueryPictIndexValues(), SProcRenderCreatePicture(), SProcRenderChangePicture(), SProcRenderSetPictureClipRectangles(), SProcRenderFreePicture(), SProcRenderComposite(), SProcRenderScale(), SProcRenderCreateGlyphSet(), SProcRenderReferenceGlyphSet(), SProcRenderFreeGlyphSet(), SProcRenderFreeGlyphs(), SProcRenderCompositeGlyphs().",
    "root_cause": "The X server does not properly validate the lengths and offsets in requests from X clients when processing the Render extension.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious X client can cause the X server to access or overwrite arbitrary memory, leading to denial of service (e.g., X server crash), or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious X client sends a crafted request to the X server via the Render extension.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the X server, after having been authenticated."
