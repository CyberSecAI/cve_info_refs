Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8986:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `adm_config_report.php` page in MantisBT displayed a dropdown list of configuration values, but it failed to validate if the selected config value was valid.
*   Specifically, the application did not properly sanitize or escape the configuration value before displaying it on the page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By manipulating the POST/GET request, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the configuration value. Because the application failed to sanitize the input, this script would then be executed in the user's browser when they viewed the configuration report page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could allow them to:
    *   Steal session cookies
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites
    *   Deface the web page
    *   Perform other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP request (POST/GET) that modifies the configuration value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a high-privileged account (e.g. administrator) to access the configuration report page, as the vulnerability is located within the administrative interface.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in MantisBT versions 1.2.13 up to 1.2.17.
*   It was fixed in version 1.2.18.
*   The fix involved adding a check to validate if the config value exists before displaying it.
*   The initial fix involved using the `string_display_line` function, which was later suggested to be replaced with `string_attribute`.

The provided content also indicates that the initial fix was related to the issue with the selection list in the filters. It was later clarified that the vulnerability in "set configuration" box was a different one.
