I don't think we're talking about the same issue here. The one you
describe was about the selection list in the filters, this one is in the
"set configuration" box.

Subject: RE: CVE Request: XSS vulnerability in MantisBT 1.2.13

Hi Damien,

Please can you ensure that you appropriate proper credit for security issues - we identified this issue in Master back in May and this was due to be backported to be 1.2.18 release:

The adm_config_report.php displays a dropdown list of configuration values, but does not check that the config value is valid - therefore someone could change the post/get request to modify the value to pass XSS onto the page.

We fixed this issue in Master with the following commit <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/cabacdc291c251bfde0dc2a2c945c02cef41bf40>, and I believe I requested this to be back-ported at the time. You modified the code not to trigger an error with the commit <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/3d0625d84d5d08a998673713df1711e1d46b0b86> and to fall back to the default of no value selected.

I don't believe it is correct to state that an issue was discovered in November that we had already discovered, fixed and were planning on backporting to the 1.2.18 release in May, and not credit the people who discovered and fixed the original issue.

Paul

Subject: [oss-security] CVE Request: XSS vulnerability in MantisBT 1.2.13

Please assign a CVE ID for the following issue.

Description:

The MantisBT Configuration Report page (adm_config_report.php) did not escape a parameter before displaying it on the page, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

The severity of this issue is mitigated by the need to have a high-privileged account (by default, administrator) to access the configuration report page.

Affected versions:
 >= 1.2.13, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:
Issue was discovered by Alejo Popovici and fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Ok - having looked further - I agree that this is two separate issues - so
can we have a CVE for both issues separately.

However, I believe the fix for first issue to be incorrect (hence helping
me misunderstanding the initial issue):

The initial fix adds a string_display_line call to an <input> box. Given
that this processes the string for display in html, and there is a
string_attribute api call for handling data for display in a text box, I
believe that the fix for the other  issue is incorrect and
that string_attribute should be used instead of string_display_line (which
may do other formatting to the string which may be undesirable when editing
configuration values).
