Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8703:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input when editing page content and settings values (navigation, title, description, keywords & copyright).

**Weakness:**
- Lack of input sanitization. The application does not encode or filter user-supplied data before displaying it on web pages.

**Impact:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page content or settings.
- When a user views the affected pages or settings, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially leading to:
  - Session hijacking.
  - Stealing of cookies.
  - Defacement of the website.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker can edit a page or modify settings via the web interface of Wonder CMS, inserting malicious JavaScript code.
- The injected script will be executed when the page or settings containing the payload is viewed by other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to edit pages or settings within the Wonder CMS application, implying they must have some level of administrative or content editing access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content explicitly mentions that the vulnerability exists when editing "page content" but also when setting values such as "navigation, title, description, keywords & copyright"
- The vulnerability can be triggered by inserting HTML tags like `<script>` or even using broken image tags, such as `![](x)`.
