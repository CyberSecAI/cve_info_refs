Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-8677:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The installation process of SOPlanning is vulnerable to PHP code injection. Specifically, the database name field during installation is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- PHP code injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary PHP code execution on the server. An attacker can inject and execute PHP code by manipulating the database name during the installation process. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker interacts with the installation interface of SOPlanning, specifically by modifying the database name during the install process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the SOPlanning installation page (e.g., `http://localhost/install`).
- The attacker needs to supply valid database credentials (host, user, password).
- The attacker's database user must either have access to a database with a specially crafted name (e.g., "so';phpinfo();//") or have privileges to create a database with this name.
-  For installed instances, the install interface must be accessible, and one of the following conditions must be met:
    - PHP version is older than 5.2
    - Configured database server is down
    - The directory smarty/templates_c is not writable

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited both during a fresh installation and in some cases on already installed instances.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by injecting PHP code (e.g., `phpinfo()`) into the database name field during the installation process.
- The vulnerability exists because of the lack of sanitization of the database name field during the installation process, allowing the injection of code that will later be executed.
