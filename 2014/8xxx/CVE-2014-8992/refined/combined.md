Hi guys,

Wasn't sure where to report this, the main site didn't have a clear email/section for reporting security vulnerabilities that I could find.

So after testing MODX for some basic vulnerabilities, I came across the FileAPI.flash.image.swf file had a parameter called scale & callback.

The callback parameter is vulnerable to XSS, if you close off the try/catch block, then you can execute an alert:

//MODX/manager/assets/fileapi/FileAPI.flash.image.swf?scale=onw1b&callback=%29}catch%28e%29{};alert%281%29;//

I hope this can be of use to you guys.

Thanks.
