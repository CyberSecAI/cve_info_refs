CVE-2014-8673:
  - Root cause of vulnerability:  Lack of proper user input sanitization in multiple areas of the application. The application uses the unsafe `addslashes()` PHP function instead of `mysql_real_escape_string()`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: SQL Injection vulnerabilities in:
    - `planning.php` project, user and task filters
    - `user_list.php`, `projets.php`, `user_groupes.php`, `groupe_list.php` via `order by` statement
    - `process/planning.php` via `triPlanning` GET parameter
    - `process/planning.php` via `nb_lignes` cookie (LIMIT statement)
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other confidential information. In some cases, attacker might be able to write to arbitrary files.
  - Attack vectors:
    - Sending specially crafted POST requests to `/process/planning.php`
    - Sending crafted GET requests to `/user_list.php`, `/projets.php`, `/user_groupes.php`, `/groupe_list.php`
    - Sending crafted GET requests to `/process/planning.php`
    - Setting a crafted `nb_lignes` cookie before visiting `/process/planning.php`
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
