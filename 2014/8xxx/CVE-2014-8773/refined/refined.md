The provided content is related to CVE-2014-8773.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a combination of CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities present in the Manager login of MODX Revolution and potentially the Login Extra.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** A malicious user can formulate a link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, automatically logs the user into their account without their explicit consent.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The login mechanism allows for a crafted link to redirect the user to an attacker-controlled site immediately after login, exposing the user's CSRF token.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **CSRF token exposure:** The attacker can gain access to the user's CSRF token, which is used to validate legitimate requests to the server.
- **Account compromise:** With the exposed CSRF token, the attacker can perform actions on behalf of the user, potentially leading to account compromise, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to resources.
- **Redirection to attacker-controlled site:** The immediate redirection to a malicious site may be used for further attacks or information theft.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The attack is performed by crafting a URL that triggers the login process and redirects the user to an attacker-controlled site.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to click the malicious link while logged in to a vulnerable MODX Revolution instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable login mechanism.
- **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create the crafted link.
- **Ability to host or control an external site:** The attacker needs a site to redirect the user to.
- **User being logged in to MODX:** The attack works by exploiting a user that is already logged into the MODX manager.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects MODX Revolution versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.14.
- The fix is to upgrade to MODX Revolution 2.2.15. No patch is available for older versions due to the number of changes needed.
- The vulnerability was reported by Narendra Bhati of Suma Soft.
