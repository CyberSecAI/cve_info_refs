- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in a command ('Command Injection'). The Atx45.ocx control can be initialized and called by malicious scripts potentially causing a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection vulnerability leading to potential buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation through malicious scripts that initialize and call the vulnerable control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker with low skill level can exploit these vulnerabilities.
