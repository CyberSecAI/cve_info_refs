Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the comment field of uploaded files. Specifically, the `_20_body` parameter is vulnerable to the injection of malicious web script or HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The malicious script is stored within the application's database.
- **Improper Input Neutralization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input within the comment field when uploading a file. This allows for the insertion of malicious script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary web script or HTML in the victim's browser. This allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the webpage.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator views the malicious comment, the injected script will execute in the context of their browser session, potentially giving the attacker administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the web interface of the Liferay Portal.
- **Uploaded File Comments:** The attacker injects malicious script into the comment field when uploading a file.
- **Workflow Tasks:** The injected script is triggered when an administrator clicks "View" from under the "My Workflow Tasks" option within the "My Account" menu and looks for the approval of comments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Liferay Portal.
- **File Upload Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the system.
- **Administrator Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator views the comments section of a file uploaded by the attacker from the "My Workflow Tasks" section.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Liferay Portal 6.2 EE SP8 and older versions.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed, and the patch identifier is LPE-12961.
