## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1460)

## Topic

Updated wireshark packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol analyzer,
which is used to capture and browse the traffic running on a computer
network.

Several denial of service flaws were found in Wireshark. Wireshark could
crash or stop responding if it read a malformed packet off a network, or
opened a malicious dump file. (CVE-2014-8714, CVE-2014-8712, CVE-2014-8713,
CVE-2014-8711, CVE-2014-8710, CVE-2015-0562, CVE-2015-0564, CVE-2015-2189,
CVE-2015-2191)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, the Wireshark tool did not support Advanced Encryption

Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) cryptographic algorithm. As a
consequence, AES-GCM was not decrypted. Support for AES-GCM has been added
to Wireshark, and AES-GCM is now correctly decrypted. (BZ#1095065)

* Previously, when installing the system using the kickstart method, a

dependency on the shadow-utils packages was missing from the wireshark
packages, which could cause the installation to fail with a "bad scriptlet"
error message. With this update, shadow-utils are listed as required in the
wireshark packages spec file, and kickstart installation no longer fails.
(BZ#1121275)

* Prior to this update, the Wireshark tool could not decode types of

elliptic curves in Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Client Hello.
Consequently, Wireshark incorrectly displayed elliptic curves types as
data. A patch has been applied to address this bug, and Wireshark now
decodes elliptic curves types properly. (BZ#1131203)

* Previously, a dependency on the gtk2 packages was missing from the

wireshark packages. As a consequence, the Wireshark tool failed to start
under certain circumstances due to an unresolved symbol,
"gtk\_combo\_box\_text\_new\_with\_entry", which was added in gtk version 2.24.
With this update, a dependency on gtk2 has been added, and Wireshark now
always starts as expected. (BZ#1160388)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* With this update, the Wireshark tool supports process substitution, which

feeds the output of a process (or processes) into the standard input of
another process using the "<(command\_list)" syntax. When using process
substitution with large files as input, Wireshark failed to decode such
input. (BZ#1104210)

* Wireshark has been enhanced to enable capturing packets with nanosecond

time stamp precision, which allows better analysis of recorded network
traffic. (BZ#1146578)

All wireshark users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements. All running instances of Wireshark must be restarted for the
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1163584#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-13 04:29:51 UTC  ``` It was reported that Wireshark's SigComp dissector could crash. It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.  This is reported to affect Wireshark versions 1.10.0 to 1.10.10. It is fixed in versions 1.12.2 and 1.10.11.  <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10662>  The version of Wireshark in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 is older than 1.10.x, and may not be affected. The version of Wireshark in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is affected.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c0)  Martin Prpič    2015-01-08 15:02:07 UTC  ``` It was reported that Wireshark's DEC DNA Routing Protocol dissector could crash. It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.  This is reported to affect Wireshark versions 1.12.0 to 1.12.2, and 1.10.0 to 1.10.11. It is fixed in versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.12.  <https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10724>  External References:  <https://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2015-03.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-01-08 15:02:32 UTC  ```  Created wireshark tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1180183](show_bug.cgi?id=1180183 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-0562 wireshark: DEC DNA Routing Protocol dissector crash (wnpa-sec-2015-03) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c3)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-01-15 14:12:31 UTC  ``` upstream fix ============  <https://code.wireshark.org/review/gitweb?p=wireshark.git;a=patch;h=1bc3b8adb2ef850a0b90542bfac5f4b90f051e92>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c4)  Siddharth Sharma    2015-01-16 09:24:59 UTC  ``` Analysis ========  In the code of DEC DNA Routing Protocol dissector in function   set_dnet_address(packet_info *pinfo, address *paddr_src, address *paddr_tgt)  {      if (paddr_tgt->type != AT_STRINGZ && paddr_src->type == AT_ETHER) {          char *addr = dnet_ntoa((const guint8 *)paddr_src->data);          if (addr != NULL)             SET_ADDRESS(paddr_tgt, AT_STRINGZ, 1, addr);      }  }  when it executes SET_ADDRESS(paddr_tgt, AT_STRINGZ, 1, addr); the packet-scope memory might have been freed already which would lead to crash.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c8)  Martin Žember    2015-05-28 13:54:50 UTC  ``` Correct me if I am wrong, I see the same code from [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c4) in the current RHEL-7 version wireshark-1.10.3-18.el7.  But please, if fixing this, avoid introducing the [CVE-2015-3182](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2015-3182) into the code by applying a patch that uses wmem_strdup() without including appropriate wmem headers.  Do it as Peter Hatina correctly did in the RHEL-6 version (wireshark branch 1.8.x), the old-school without wmem:  -            SET_ADDRESS(paddr_tgt, AT_STRINGZ, 1, addr); +            SET_ADDRESS(paddr_tgt, AT_STRINGZ, 1, +                ep_strdup(addr));  Or, with correct #include pragmas.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 07:24:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1460 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1460.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1180182#c13)  Jaroslav Aster    2015-10-01 16:05:06 UTC  ``` Unfortunately, I found segfault on rhel-7.  # rpm -q wireshark wireshark-1.10.14-5.el7.x86_64  # tshark -nr fuzz-2014-11-22-10244.pcap  Running as user "root" and group "root".
