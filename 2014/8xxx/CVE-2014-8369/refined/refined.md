Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2014-8369:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `kvm_iommu_map_pages` function in the Linux kernel miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure. This was a regression introduced by an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-3601.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect calculation of page numbers during IOMMU mapping failure.
- Inconsistent API between `kvm_pin_pages()` which takes a size, and `kvm_unpin_pages()` which takes the number of pages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A privileged guest user can cause a denial of service on the host OS by triggering page unpinning issues.
- Potentially, other unspecified impacts on the host OS.
- System crash

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access within a guest OS with an assigned host device.
- Crafted application within the guest.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  A privileged user in a guest OS with assigned host devices.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `virt/kvm/iommu.c`.
- The issue arises during handling of IOMMU mapping failures, where the number of pages to be unpinned are miscalculated
- The vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-3601.
- The fix involves correcting the third parameter passed to kvm\_unpin\_pages() to be the number of pages instead of page size and matching the API of kvm\_pin\_pages()
- Red Hat indicates this issue has a "Moderate" impact.
- SUSE rates the vulnerability as "important".
- The vulnerability is addressed in Red Hat by RHSA-2015:0674, and in SUSE Linux Enterprise by SUSE-SU-2015:0481-1 and SUSE-SU-2015:0736-1.
