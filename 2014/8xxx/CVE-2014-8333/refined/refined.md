  "CVE-2014-8333": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) VMWare driver, which could allow an authenticated user to delete an instance while it was in the resize state, causing the instance to remain on the back end. A malicious user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by exhausting all available resources on the system.",
    "root_cause": "The VMWare driver renames the instance on the source host to be instance['uuid']-orig during a resize/migration before the vm_state goes to RESIZED. The deletion process will confirm any resizes which are in the RESIZED state so they are cleaned up properly. However, there is a window between the renaming of the instance and vm state going to RESIZED.  Additionally, the driver method for deleting an instance does not check for the presence of an instance named instance['uuid']-orig.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "VMware driver instance rename before RESIZED state",
      "Deletion process doesn't check for 'uuid-orig' instance"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by exhausting resources on the system by leaking VMs.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Deleting a VM while it is in the resizing state."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An authenticated user with the ability to create and delete VMs.",
	"additional_details": "The fix includes attempting to delete the original VM within the destroy phase, as the task state is set to 'deleting' and can not be used to determine resize migration/migrated state."
