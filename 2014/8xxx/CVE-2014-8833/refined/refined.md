- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A deserialization issue existed in Spotlight's handling of permission caches.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Deserialization vulnerability, leading to insufficient privilege checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user performing a Spotlight query may have been shown search results referencing files for which they don't have sufficient privileges to read.
- **Attack vectors**: Performing a Spotlight search.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a local user able to perform Spotlight searches.
