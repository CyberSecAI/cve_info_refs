4. Affected Components Description
==================================

Business Objects is part of the Business Intelligence platform from SAP.
It has components that provide performance management, planning,
reporting, query and analysis and enterprise information management.

Every Business Objects installation provides a web service to interact
with different platform services.

5. Vulnerability Details
========================

The vulnerability could be exploited by sending a web services request
to the Session web service and attempting SecEnterprise authentication.
By timing the replies from the remote server an attacker can identify
existent and non-existent users. Specifically, an authentication attempt
from the remote server using an existing username will cause the server
to take longer to respond than a username that does not exist.

6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 2001109 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2001109>.

reduce business risks.
