Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8309:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a timing discrepancy in the SAP Business Objects Session web service during SecEnterprise authentication attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy (CWE-208):** The system responds differently to authentication attempts with valid usernames compared to non-existent usernames. Specifically, authentication attempts for existing usernames take longer to process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can enumerate valid usernames by timing the server's responses to authentication requests.
*   **Further Attacks:** The discovered usernames can be used to specialize attacks against the system, potentially leading to more severe compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable by sending web service requests to the Session web service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable SAP Business Objects server.
*   **No Authentication Required:**  The attacker does not need to have any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary:**

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to discover valid usernames on a vulnerable SAP Business Objects system by exploiting a timing discrepancy in the authentication process. This information can then be used to further attacks on the system.
