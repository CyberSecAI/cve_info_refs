Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-8617:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of input validation for the "release" parameter in the "/module/releasecontrol" endpoint of FortiMail version 5.2.1.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/script code through the "release" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML/script code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML/script code within the context of a victim user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `release` parameter of the `/module/releasecontrol` path.
   - The attacker then needs to get a victim user to click this crafted URL, while they have an authenticated session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to know the IP address of the FortiMail device.
- The victim needs to have an active, authenticated session with the Fortimail instance.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in Fortimail version 5.2.1.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.2.3, which is recommended as a solution to mitigate the risk.
