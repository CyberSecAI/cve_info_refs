- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An issue existed in the rendering of the lock screen where it might not lock immediately upon wake.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is related to the lock screen rendering not being immediate after waking up from sleep mode.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The user might perceive a delay before the lock screen appears on wake, potentially exposing the system briefly.
- **Attack vectors:** Local, by waking up the computer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access and ability to wake the computer.
