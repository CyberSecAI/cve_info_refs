## Description

[![@ghost](https://github.com/ghost.png?size=48)](/ghost)[ghost](/ghost)opened [on Mar 17, 2015](https://github.com/redhat-cip/edeploy/issues/230#issue-62541030)

Found in a past security audit, agreed with Tristan to make public and file issues here.

Please see <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1202972>

edeploy uses HTTP to download a large number of sensitive files which can lead to code execution:

./ansible/edeploy-install.yml: value=http://{{ ansible\_default\_ipv4["address"] }}/
