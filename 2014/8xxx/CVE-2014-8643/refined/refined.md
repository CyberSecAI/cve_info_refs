  "CVE-2014-8643": {
    "description": "Security researcher **Nils** discovered a mechanism to break out of the Gecko Media Plugin (GMP) sandbox on Windows systems. The GMP sandbox is currently only used to host h.264 video playback using the OpenH264 plugin but is being developed to host other other media plugins. This bug would allow an attacker to escape or bypass the GMP sandbox if another exploitable bug is found in a GMP media plugin which allowed them to compromise the GMP process.",
    "vulnerability": "The sandboxed plugin-container.exe process on Windows holds a handle to the parent process. This handle, while having limited access rights, still allows handle duplication in the parent process using `DuplicateHandle(0x18c, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 2)`.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is the inheritance of a handle to the parent process by the sandboxed GMP process on Windows, combined with the ability for a compromised child process to call `OpenProcess`. This is due to the child process inheriting all inheritable handles from its parent process, and a flaw in the Chromium code that doesn't correctly check the return value of OpenProcess.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unnecessary handle inheritance",
      "Insufficient sandbox restrictions",
      "Incorrect return value check in Chromium base library"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit allows an attacker to gain full access to the parent process and execute arbitrary code. This can lead to complete system compromise and privilege escalation by escaping the GMP sandbox.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves exploiting a vulnerability in the GMP media plugin to gain code execution within the sandboxed process. Then, leveraging the inherited parent process handle with  `DuplicateHandle`  to gain full control of the parent process.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs initial code execution within the sandboxed GMP process, which could be achieved through another vulnerability in the media plugin. No special network access is required as it's a local privilege escalation vulnerability once the initial code execution is gained.",
    "affected_products": [
      "Firefox on Windows",
        "SeaMonkey on OpenSUSE"
    ],
    "fixed_versions": [
      "Firefox 35",
         "SeaMonkey 2.32 on OpenSUSE"
    ],
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is specific to Windows systems; OS X and Linux systems are not affected. Additionally, it was discovered that a security upgrade landed in Firefox 36 and newer that mitigates the issue by causing OpenProcess to fail in the sandboxed process."
