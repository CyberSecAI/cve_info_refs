{
  "CVE-2014-8554": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mc_project_get_attachments` function in the MantisBT SOAP API was vulnerable to SQL injection because the `project_id` parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. Specifically, the code used `implode()` to construct the SQL `IN` clause, concatenating the project IDs directly into the query without proper escaping or parameterization.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, allowing them to access, modify, or delete data. Depending on database permissions, this could potentially lead to complete database compromise or data exfiltration.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the SOAP API's `mc_project_get_attachments` method. An attacker needs to send a SOAP request with a specially crafted `project_id` parameter.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access and interact with the MantisBT SOAP API. This could be through an authenticated session, or, if the system permits anonymous access, without authentication. The attacker needs knowledge of the API's method and parameter names, and be capable of crafting SOAP requests."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `mc_project_get_attachments` function in the MantisBT SOAP API used unsanitized input for the `project_id` parameter when constructing a SQL query, leading to a SQL injection.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks by manipulating the `project_id` parameter. This allows them to retrieve unauthorized data, potentially including sensitive information, from the database and can also lead to other attacks.",
       "Attack vectors": "By sending a SOAP request to the `mc_project_get_attachments` function with a specially crafted `project_id` parameter that includes malicious SQL code.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make SOAP requests to the MantisBT API. This could be done with or without authentication if the application permits. The attacker must have knowledge of the API's endpoint and the parameters it expects."
