- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based and Heap-based buffer overflow in Schneider Electric VAMPSET software when processing malformed disturbance recording files (.CFG or .DAT).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121), heap-based buffer overflow. The software doesn't properly validate the length of strings in Comtrade files, specifically station name and device identification, leading to a buffer overflow when opening crafted files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code by providing a malicious CFG or DAT file. The software crashes when a malformed file is opened, which can disrupt operations.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack. The vulnerability is triggered when a local user opens a malformed disturbance recording file using the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to convince a local user to load a malicious file. Social engineering techniques are required. Physical access to the system is not required, as long as the malformed file can be provided to the victim.
