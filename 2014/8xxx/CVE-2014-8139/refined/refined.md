{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow in the `crc32()` function when handling a ZIP extra field with a length less than 4. Specifically, the length argument to `crc32()` becomes a large value, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Heap-based buffer over-read",
      "Insufficient input validation"
     ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause a crash of the `unzip` utility when testing a specially crafted ZIP archive with the '-t' option.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious actor can create a ZIP archive with a crafted extra field with a length less than 4.",
      "The victim must use `unzip` with the `-t` option on the crafted ZIP archive."
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a specific zip file, no special position is needed. The user needs to test the archive with 'unzip -t'."
