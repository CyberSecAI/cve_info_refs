Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload functionality in the "Photo" section of the Digi Online Examination System version 2.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system does not properly validate or filter uploaded files, allowing users to upload arbitrary files, including malicious ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP shell (e.g., `shellname.php`), an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This grants them significant control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface during the user registration process. Specifically, the "Photo" upload section.
- **HTTP Requests:** An attacker would send an HTTP request to upload the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User Account:** An attacker needs to be able to access the user registration or profile update area in order to upload files.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Path:** They would need to know where the uploaded files are stored on the server (e.g., `http://example.com/assets/uploads/images/`) in order to access and execute them.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit description mentions a solution: "Filter the files against to attacks," which means the vulnerability can be fixed by adding checks to the upload process for dangerous extensions, contents, etc.
