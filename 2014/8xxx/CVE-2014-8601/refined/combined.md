## Recursive DNS resolver implementations may follow referrals infinitely

#### Vulnerability Note VU#264212

Original Release Date: 2014-12-09 | Last Revised: 2015-10-27

---

### Overview

Recursive DNS resolvers may become stuck following an infinite chain of referrals due to a malicious authoritative server.

### Description

| RFC 1034 describes the standard technical issues of enabling domain delegations in DNS, but does not provide a specific implementation, leaving DNS servers to provide their own methods to implement RFC 1034. In some implementations of recursive resolvers, a query to a malicious authoritative server may cause the resolver to follow an infinite chain of referrals. Attempting to follow the infinite chain can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) situation on the DNS resolver due to resource exhaustion.  This issue primarily affects recursive resolvers. Additionally, as noted in ISC Security Advisory [AA-01216](https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01216): "Authoritative servers can be affected if an attacker can control a delegation traversed by the authoritative server in servicing the zone."Depending on how the resolver handles out-of-bailiwick glue records and performs simultaneous queries, it may also be possible to cause the resolver to perform a DoS attack on a target using DNS traffic. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A recursive DNS resolver following an infinite chain of referrals can result in high process memory and CPU usage and eventually process termination. The effect can range from increased server response time to clients to complete interruption of the service.Resolvers that follow multiple referrals at once can cause large bursts of network traffic. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These issues are addressed by limiting the maximum number of referrals followed and the number of simultaneous queries. See the [Vendor Information](#vendors) section below for information about specific vendors. |

Package        : pdns-recursor
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8601

Florian Maury from ANSSI discovered a flaw in pdns-recursor, a
recursive DNS server : a remote attacker controlling
maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server could affect the
performance of pdns-recursor, thus leading to resource exhaustion and
a potential denial-of-service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3-3+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.6.2-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor packages.

* Not affected: PowerDNS Recursor 3.6.2; no versions of PowerDNS Authoritative Server
* Severity: High
* Impact: Degraded service
* Exploit: This problem can be triggered by sending queries for specifically configured domains
* Risk of system compromise: No
* Solution: Upgrade to PowerDNS Recursor 3.6.2
* Workaround: None known. Exposure can be limited by configuring the **allow-from** setting so only trusted users can query your nameserver.

Recently we released PowerDNS Recursor 3.6.2 with a new feature that
strictly limits the amount of work we'll perform to resolve a single query.
This feature was inspired by performance degradations noted when resolving
domains hosted by 'ezdns.it', which can require thousands of queries to
resolve.

During the 3.6.2 release process, we were contacted by a government security
agency with news that they had found that all major caching nameservers,
including PowerDNS, could be negatively impacted by specially configured,
hard to resolve domain names. With their permission, we continued the 3.6.2
release process with the fix for the issue already in there.

We recommend that all users upgrade to 3.6.2 if at all possible. Alternatively,
if you want to apply a minimal fix to your own tree, it can be found
[here](https://downloads.powerdns.com/patches/2014-02/), including patches for older versions.

As for workarounds, only clients in allow-from are able to trigger the
degraded service, so this should be limited to your userbase.
