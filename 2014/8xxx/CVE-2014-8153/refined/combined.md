| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c0)  Nir Magnezi    2014-12-01 15:17:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 963325](attachment.cgi?id=963325 "tests") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=963325&action=edit "tests") tests  Description of problem: ======================= At a certain point, while testing neutron for IPv6, neutron ports created for router interfaces remind DOWN upon attachment. This happened twice while running the same test plan and at similar stage. Since there is no short reproduction scenario, I'll attach files with the tests I executed.  In addition, I noticed that while this issue persists with the router I created, when I create an additional router (without removing the "problematic" one), router interface attachments (hence, port creations) works fine.  I will add information to this bug as we discover more.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): ============================================================= RHEL-OSP6-Beta: openstack-neutron-2014.2-11.el7ost.noarch  How reproducible: ================= Reproduced 2 times so far.  Steps to Reproduce: =================== * See attached file named: tests * The steps below sums the reproduction when the issue takes place in the Openstack setup 1. create a neutron router 2. create network, subnet (I used both IPv4 & IPv6) 3. attach the subnet to the router  Actual results: =============== As described in: 'Description of problem'  for server.log when port creation fails: see attached: port_down file  You'll notice that it does not reach to the 'Attempting to bind port' part.  Expected results: ================= Should work OK. for server.log when port creation succeeds: see attached: port_active file   Additional info: ================ Will probably be found in the upcoming comments.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c1)  Nir Magnezi    2014-12-01 15:19:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 963326](attachment.cgi?id=963326 "port_down") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=963326&action=edit "port_down") port_down   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c2)  Nir Magnezi    2014-12-01 15:19:42 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 963327](attachment.cgi?id=963327 "port_active") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=963327&action=edit "port_active") port_active   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c5)  Nir Magnezi    2014-12-01 15:39:55 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 963340](attachment.cgi?id=963340 "IPv6 plan log") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=963340&action=edit "IPv6 plan log") IPv6 plan log   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c6)  Ihar Hrachyshka    2014-12-02 10:31:44 UTC  ``` As was said before, the problem is with one of the routers. Other routers work fine.  Some log reading below:  When a subnet is attached to the router, the following can be found in server.log on l3 agent side:  2014-11-30 11:29:52.352 2686 DEBUG neutron.agent.l3_agent [req-06a126a5-fac3-4f5c-915e-07cb51da821b None] Got routers updated notification :[u'c480186a-0a2f-4f1c-b0d1-89251760f9cd'] routers_updated /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/agent/l3_agent.py:1763  Though there are no "Starting router update for %s" messages in the log. They were initially shown in logs some time ago four times, but then disappeared.  2014-11-27 15:15:54.005 2686 DEBUG neutron.agent.l3_agent [-] Starting router update for c480186a-0a2f-4f1c-b0d1-89251760f9cd _process_router_update /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/agent/l3_agent.py:1830 2014-11-27 15:15:57.433 2686 DEBUG neutron.agent.l3_agent [-] Starting router update for c480186a-0a2f-4f1c-b0d1-89251760f9cd _process_router_update /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/agent/l3_agent.py:1830 2014-11-27 15:16:03.493 2686 DEBUG neutron.agent.l3_agent [-] Starting router update for c480186a-0a2f-4f1c-b0d1-89251760f9cd _process_router_update /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/agent/l3_agent.py:1830 2014-11-27 15:16:33.067 2686 DEBUG neutron.agent.l3_agent [-] Starting router update for c480186a-0a2f-4f1c-b0d1-89251760f9cd _process_router_update /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/agent/l3_agent.py:1830 2014-11-27 15:16:47.848 2686 DEBUG neutron.agent.l3_agent [-] Starting router update for c480186a-0a2f-4f1c-b0d1-89251760f9cd _process_router_update /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/neutron/agent/l3_agent.py:1830  So the update notification is received from controller, and probably put into RouterUpdate queue, but then not served properly.  Code wise, for updates, there is a RouterProcessingQueue that provides parallel access to updates via each_update_to_next_router() generator that is intended to serialize parallel update requests by giving exclusive read access to update queue to one of the green threads that serve _process_router_update() calls. The code of the queue and exclusive accessor seems quite hacky and may indeed contain some race condition that would end up blocking any new updates to some unlucky router.  It could also be the case that _process_router_update() greenthread pool is full and locked, so no new updates are actually served, but in that case new requests for other routers wouldn't be served properly. Also, no l3 agent file locks seem to be set for a long time in /var/lib/neutron/...   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c7)  Nir Magnezi    2014-12-02 14:10:30 UTC  ``` Reproduction scenario narrowed down to this: 1. Attach an IPv4 subnet --> port is active 2. Attach an IPv6 RADVD (stateless, stateful, slacc) subnet --> port is active  3. from that point and on, this router is broken and all attachments stop working. port status remain down.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c8)  Ihar Hrachyshka    2014-12-02 20:57:36 UTC  ``` So it's radvd thing. Once I downgrade to radvd < 2.0, everything works fine again. Looking at the diff between 1.14 and 2.0, daemonization code was changed significantly for the 2.0 release.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c9)  Nir Yechiel    2014-12-03 09:46:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ihar Hrachyshka from [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c8)) > So it's radvd thing. Once I downgrade to radvd < 2.0, everything works fine > again. Looking at the diff between 1.14 and 2.0, daemonization code was > changed significantly for the 2.0 release.  Hi Ihar,  Nice catch :)  What do you think would be the right way to proceed here? Should we file a bug for radvd or downgrade the version?  Thanks, Nir   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c10)  Ihar Hrachyshka    2014-12-03 11:31:35 UTC  ``` @Nir, we should fix neutron to work properly with all versions of radvd. It's as easy as passing additional '-m syslog' argument to radvd to make it close stderr in all versions of the daemon. I'm working on fixing it in u/s.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1169408#c12)  Ihar Hrachyshka    2014-12-12 15:20:10 UTC  ``` Now that we dropped radvd 2.+ from RDO and RHOSP, we may downgrade the bug to Rawhide, the only Red Hat project that includes the new radvd version.   ``` |  |

### Bug Description

Reported by Ihar Hrachyshka via email:

we've found a bug [1] in Openstack Neutron Juno (2014.2) release that

(it seems) may be utilized to make Neutron L3 agent non-functional

during the following scenario (initially reported in downstream as [2]):

- a tenant (user) creates 8 routers;

- for each router, a tenant assigns a ipv6 non-provider subnet.

=> L3 agent limits the number of threads that process updates to

router state to 8 [3]. Since the bug makes the thread lock if the

release is used with radvd 2.0+, it's enough to have those 8 failing

routers to completely block any kind of router updates processing for

all tenants.

The vulnerability is limited to setups that run on top of radvd 2.0+.

There are few distributions that currently ship radvd 2.0+,

so the scope of the vulnerability is not very wide (in Red Hat world,

it's mostly Fedora Rawhide).

The bug in question is public, though I haven't raised its potential

security status in any public or private communications before.

The security implication seems appropriate. I have not reproduced it, but looking at the code it is pretty obvious what will happen with the different behaviour of radvd 2

In Icehouse, we didn't have radvd support, so there should be no issue.

### Bug Description

In radvd 2.0+, daemonization code was rewritten, switching from libdaemon's daemon\_fork() to Linux daemon() call.

If no logging method (-m option) is passed to radvd, and the default logging method is used (which is L\_STDERR\_SYSLOG), then daemon() is called with (1, 1) arguments, meaning no chroot (fine) and not closing stderr (left there for logging) (not fine). So execute() call that spawns radvd and expects it to daemonize and return code never actually completes, blocked on stderr.

The fix is to pass e.g. -m syslog to radvd to make it close stderr and return.

radvd: pass -m syslog to avoid thread lock for radvd 2.0+

Since radvd 2.0, the daemon does not use daemon\_fork() function from

    libdaemon, but instead calls Linux daemon() function directly. It also

    passes (1, 1) arguments when logging method (-m) is either stderr (the

    default) or stderr\_syslog. The second argument's value = 1 means that

    stderr is not closed and left there for (some) log messages.

For neutron, it means that corresponding execute() call that spawns

    radvd and expects the invoked process to close stderr does not ever get

    completed. The current thread that spawned radvd is locked waiting for

    radvd to exit, which does not ever occur unless the process crashes or

    receives a signal.

Since L3 agent gives exclusive access to updates queue for each router

    to one of processing threads only, it means that the thread that got to

    serve a radvd-powered subnet will not proceed and not update any new

    ports or other changes to the router anymore.

Passing -m syslog makes radvd 2.0+ close stderr and return to execute()

    caller, proceeding with router update processing. The same arguments

    should work for old (pre 2.0) versions of radvd too, so passing them

    unconditionally.

We could instead use -m logfile and pass appropriate -l <logfile>

    argument to radvd to make it log to a log file located in router's

    namespace storage path. Though that would be not in line with what

    dnsmasq processes currently do for dhcp agent, where we log all messages

    to syslog, so sticking to syslog for radvd for consistency.

### Bug Description

Reported by Ihar Hrachyshka via email:

we've found a bug [1] in Openstack Neutron Juno (2014.2) release that

(it seems) may be utilized to make Neutron L3 agent non-functional

during the following scenario (initially reported in downstream as [2]):

- a tenant (user) creates 8 routers;

- for each router, a tenant assigns a ipv6 non-provider subnet.

=> L3 agent limits the number of threads that process updates to

router state to 8 [3]. Since the bug makes the thread lock if the

release is used with radvd 2.0+, it's enough to have those 8 failing

routers to completely block any kind of router updates processing for

all tenants.

The vulnerability is limited to setups that run on top of radvd 2.0+.

There are few distributions that currently ship radvd 2.0+,

so the scope of the vulnerability is not very wide (in Red Hat world,

it's mostly Fedora Rawhide).

The bug in question is public, though I haven't raised its potential

security status in any public or private communications before.

The security implication seems appropriate. I have not reproduced it, but looking at the code it is pretty obvious what will happen with the different behaviour of radvd 2

Confirming based on Salvatore's analysis.

In Icehouse, we didn't have radvd support, so there should be no issue.
