Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an arbitrary file write issue present in multiple VMware products, stemming from the ability to modify virtual machine configuration files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:**  A user with the ability to modify a virtual machine's configuration file can overwrite arbitrary files on the host operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows for privilege escalation on the host OS due to the ability to overwrite arbitrary files.
*   The vulnerability doesn't allow for privilege escalation from the guest OS to the host or vice versa, meaning host memory cannot be directly manipulated from the Guest OS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local. An attacker requires the ability to modify the configuration file of a virtual machine.
*   For ESXi, the attacker would need permissions to be added to the ESXi host or to the vCenter Server managing it, with a role of virtual machine administrator or greater.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the configuration file for the virtual machine.
*   For ESXi environments, the attacker needs to possess at least virtual machine administrator role permissions on the ESXi host or vCenter Server.

**Affected Products:**

*   VMware Workstation versions prior to 10.0.5
*   VMware Player versions prior to 6.0.5
*   VMware Fusion versions prior 6.0.5
*   VMware ESXi 5.5 without patch ESXi550-201403102-SG
*   VMware ESXi 5.1 without patch ESXi510-201404101-SG
*   VMware ESXi 5.0 without patch ESXi500-201405101-SG
