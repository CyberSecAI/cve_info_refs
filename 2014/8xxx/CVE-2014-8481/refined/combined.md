## Description

The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 does not properly handle invalid instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application that triggers (1) an improperly fetched instruction or (2) an instruction that occupies too many bytes. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2014-8480](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6mgv-w6x6-2c97 "CVE-2014-8480").

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156615#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-24 19:30:16 UTC  ``` A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's kvm emulator processed certain rip relative instructions:    * certain instructions (such as clflush) were missing proper flags in the     decoder tables which to lead to uninitialized ctxt->memopp ([CVE-2014-8480](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8480))    * certain error cases (such as failure to fetch whole instruction) also lead     to unitialized ctxt->memopp ([CVE-2014-8481](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8481))  A privileged ([CVE-2014-8480](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8480)) or unprivileged ([CVE-2014-8481](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8481)) guest user could use these flaws to crash the host.   Introduced by: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=41061cdb98a0bec464278b4db8e894a3121671f5>  [CVE-2014-8480](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8480) upstream patches: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=13e457e0eebf0a0c82c38ceb890d93eb826d62a6> <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=3f6f1480d86bf9fc16c160d803ab1d006e3058d5>  [CVE-2014-8481](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8481) upstream patches: <http://git.kernel.org/cgit/virt/kvm/kvm.git/commit/?id=a430c9166312e1aa3d80bce32374233bdbfeba32>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Nadav Amit and Andy Lutomirski for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1156615#c1)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-24 19:31:05 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1156616](show_bug.cgi?id=1156616 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8480 CVE-2014-8481 kernel: kvm: NULL pointer dereference during rip relative instruction emulation [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156615#c2)  Petr Matousek    2014-10-24 19:33:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  These issues do not affect Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.

Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    <https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/>

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.

```

Subject: CVE Request: Linux 3.17 guest-triggerable KVM OOPS

On Linux 3.17, a KVM guest can trigger a NULL pointer dereference by
forcing the host to emulate certain well-formed RIP-relative
instructions or certain types of corrupt or page-straddling
instructions.  This is almost certainly just a DoS -- there is a
single read-modify-write to the NULL pointer, and no kernel code will
consume data loaded from the NULL pointer if something is mapped
there.

The bugs, or at least dangerous code, arguably existed in much older
kernels, but the NULL pointer dereference was introduced in
41061cdb98a0bec464278b4db8e894a3121671f5, which is only present in
3.17.

To fix it, you can either revert the broken patch or you can apply
both patches here as well as the attached patch:
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/128427>
(NB: I'm not sure whether "Emulator does not decode clflush well" is necessary.)

Details:

Depending on your point of view, there are either one or two bugs
here.  Nadav Amit discovered an error in the instruction decoder that
would cause certain RIP-relative instructions to OOPS the decoder.
Specifically, rather than adding RIP to the operand address, RIP would
be added to *0 from the host's perspective.

I wrote an ugly proof-of-concept to trigger it (kvm_clflush_oops.c,
although I've cleaned it up somewhat since I originally wrote it).
That PoC only works on an SMP guest, and only when run as root.

I also discovered that Nadav's fix was incomplete (or that there was
another bug, depending on your perspective).  Certain invalid
instructions (due to multiple error cases, including a failure to
fetch part of the instruction or due to the instruction being too
long) could trigger the same NULL pointer dereference.

Nadav wrote an extremely elegant PoC that exploits this buggy error
handling, reproduced with permission below.  This PoC doesn't require
SMP or privilege; it's just crashes the host directly.  Figuring out
how it works is left as an exercise to the reader (hint: it might not
work on Atom hosts).

Please assign one or two CVEs as appropriate.  (And, if you're hosting
untrusted code on a Linux 3.17 host, patch your system!)

#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
        void *mem = mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_EXEC | PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                        MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_POPULATE, -1, 0);
        memcpy((char*)mem + 0xff3,
            "\xf0\x65\x65\x65\x65\x65\x65\x0f\x38\xf1"
            "\x05\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00", 15);
        asm volatile(“jmp *%0\n\t” : : "r" (mem+0xff3));
        return 0;
}

KVM: emulate: do not initialize memopp

```
rip_relative is only set if decode_modrm runs, and if you have ModRM
you will also have a memopp.  We can then access memopp unconditionally.
Note that rip_relative cannot be hoisted up to decode_modrm, or you
break "mov $0, xyz(%rip)".

Also, move typecast on "out of range value" of mem.ea to decode_modrm.

Together, all these optimizations save about 50 cycles on each emulated
instructions (4-6%).

KVM: emulate: avoid accessing NULL ctxt->memopp

```
A failure to decode the instruction can cause a NULL pointer access.
This is fixed simply by moving the "done" label as close as possible
to the return.

This fixes [CVE-2014-8481](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2m72-x5wj-734p "CVE-2014-8481").

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
