Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8875:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability stemming from the XML-RPC implementation in Revive Adserver and a similar issue in PHP's XML processing reported by Nir Goldshlager.  Specifically, the vulnerability arises from the potential for excessive XML entity expansion during the parsing of XML-RPC requests. This is caused by the application's use of the libxml2 library, and how it handles external entities when parsing XML data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XML Entity Expansion (CWE-776):** The core vulnerability is the ability of a malicious actor to craft XML payloads that, when parsed by the XML-RPC server, cause the XML parser to recursively expand entities, leading to excessive resource consumption (CPU and memory). This expansion is not properly limited and can lead to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted XML payloads, an attacker can consume the server's resources (CPU and memory). This can result in the application becoming unavailable or unresponsive, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **XML-RPC Endpoints:** The attack targets the XML-RPC endpoints of the Revive Adserver instance. These endpoints are present in both the delivery engine (e.g., `/www/delivery/[ad]xmlrpc.php`, `/adxmlrpc.php`) and the API (e.g., `/www/api/v2/xmlrpc/`, `/www/api/v1/xmlrpc/*.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the targeted Revive Adserver instance.
*   **Ability to send crafted XML payloads:** The attacker must be able to send specifically crafted XML payloads to the XML-RPC endpoints.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is similar to vulnerabilities previously reported in other PHP applications such as Drupal and WordPress, highlighting a common flaw in handling XML parsing in PHP applications.
*   The fix involves limiting the length of XML data processed during XML parsing, which helps prevent XML bomb attacks. This is implemented by tracking the `max_data_len` and setting the parser to stop character data processing if exceeded.

**Affected Software:**

*   Revive Adserver versions 3.0.5 and earlier.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Revive Adserver version 3.0.6 or later.
*   Upgrade to Revive Adserver version 3.1.0 or later.
