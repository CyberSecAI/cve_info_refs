# WordPress 3.9.2 Security Release

---

WordPress 3.9.2 is now available as a security release for all previous versions. We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

This release fixes a possible denial of service issue in PHP’s XML processing, reported by [Nir Goldshlager](https://twitter.com/nirgoldshlager) of the Salesforce.com Product Security Team. It  was fixed by Michael Adams and Andrew Nacin of the WordPress security team and David Rothstein of the [Drupal security team](https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-004). This is the first time our two projects have coordinated joint security releases.

WordPress 3.9.2 also contains other security changes:

* Fixes a possible but unlikely code execution when processing widgets (WordPress is not affected by default), discovered by [Alex Concha](http://www.buayacorp.com/) of the WordPress security team.
* Prevents information disclosure via XML entity attacks in the external GetID3 library, reported by [Ivan Novikov](http://onsec.ru/en/) of ONSec.
* Adds protections against brute attacks against CSRF tokens, reported by [David Tomaschik](http://systemoverlord.com/) of the Google Security Team.
* Contains some additional security hardening, like preventing cross-site scripting that could be triggered only by administrators.

We appreciated responsible disclosure of these issues directly to our security team. For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.9.2) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.9?stop_rev=29383&rev=29411).

[Download WordPress 3.9.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to **Dashboard → Updates** and simply click “Update Now”.

Sites that support automatic background updates will be updated to WordPress 3.9.2 within 12 hours. (If you are still on WordPress 3.8.3 or 3.7.3, you will also be updated to 3.8.4 or 3.7.4. We don’t support older versions, so please update to 3.9.2 for the latest and greatest.)

Already testing WordPress 4.0? The third beta is [now available](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-beta3.zip) (zip) and it contains these security fixes.

# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2014-002

## Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2014-002

* Advisory ID: REVIVE-SA-2014-002
* CVE-IDs: CVE-2014-8793, CVE-2014-8875
* Date: 2014-12-17
* Risk Level: Medium
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 3.0.5
* Versions not affected: >= 3.0.6, >= 3.1.0
* Website: <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>

## Vulnerability 1 – Denial of Service

* Vulnerability Type: XML Entity Expansion [CWE-776]
* CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8875
* CVSSv2 Base Score: 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

### Description

Similar vulnerabilities have been discovered and reported earlier in 2014 for other PHP applications, i.e. Drupal and WordPress. It has been discovered that the Revive Adserver’s XML-RPC implementation might be vulnerable to the same kind of attacks.

A remote attacker can send specifically crafted payloads to the XML-RPC endpoints of a Revive Adserver instance in an attempt to consume the server resources (CPU and memory) and ultimately lead to the application becoming unavailable or unresponsive (denial of service).

### Details

Revive Adserver XML-RPC servers, available both in the delivery engine (/www/delivery/[ad]xmlrpc.php, /adxmlrpc.php) and the API endpoints (/www/api/v2/xmlrpc/, /www/api/v1/xmlrpc/\*.php) might be vulnerable to certain types of XML entity expansion attacks, also depending on the libxml2 version available on the system.

## Vulnerability 2 – XSS

* Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Scripting [CWE-79]
* CVE-ID: CVE-2014-8793
* CVSSv2 Base Score: 4.3 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
* Also known as: HTB23242

### Description

A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was recently discovered and reported by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab (<https://www.htbridge.com/>).

A remote attacker can trick logged-in user to open a specially crafted link and execute arbitrary HTML and script code in browser in context of the vulnerable website.

### Details

Input passed via the “refresh\_page” GET parameter to “/www/admin/report-generate.php” script is not properly sanitised before being returned to the user.

Please see High-Tech Bridge’s own advisory for more information.
