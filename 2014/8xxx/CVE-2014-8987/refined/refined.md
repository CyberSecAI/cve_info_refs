Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The MantisBT Configuration Report page (`adm_config_report.php`) was vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of a parameter (`config_option`) before displaying it in an HTML input field.
- Specifically, the `t_edit_option` variable, which is derived from the `config_option` parameter, was directly embedded into the value attribute of an HTML `<input>` tag without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness was the lack of proper output encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the `config_option` parameter.
- **Incorrect escaping:** Initially, the fix employed `string_display_line()`, which is intended for display in HTML context, not within an HTML attribute context. The correct escaping function for HTML attributes is `string_attribute()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing the victim's session cookie to gain unauthorized access.
    - Data theft: Extracting sensitive information from the page or the user's browser.
    - Defacement: Altering the content of the page.
    - Phishing: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `config_option` parameter.
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL and trick a high-privileged user into clicking on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with JavaScript code embedded in the `config_option` parameter.
- The attacker needs to either:
  - Have a high-privileged account (administrator by default) to directly access the vulnerable page, or
  - Trick a user with high privileges into clicking the malicious URL to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The initial fix used `string_display_line()` which, while preventing XSS if the "text processing" option of the MantisBT Formatting plugin was enabled, is not the correct function to use inside HTML attributes.
- The vulnerability was initially fixed by commit `ee8100d`, which was later reverted due to the use of `string_display_line()`.
- The vulnerability was finally fixed using `string_attribute()` in commit `b649c9c9` .
- Multiple attempts were made to patch this vulnerability before a correct fix was implemented using the `string_attribute()` function.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the vulnerable page is only accessible to users with high privileges like administrator. However, it is pointed out that social engineering tactics could be used to exploit this by tricking admin users.
- The issue was reported by Alejo Popovici and fixed by Damien Regad.
