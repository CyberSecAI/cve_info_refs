{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application was configured to not verify SSL certificates by setting `http.verify_mode = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The application disables SSL certificate verification.",
        "Multiple instances of insecure SSL configurations exist within the codebase."
    ],
    "impact": "Man-in-the-middle attacks are facilitated as the application does not properly validate the authenticity of the server it connects to, allowing attackers to intercept and modify communications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to intercept network traffic between the application and its server."
    ],
       "additional_details": "The bug report suggests that while the default configuration should be changed to enforce proper SSL certificate validation, backwards compatibility should be maintained by providing a configuration option to disable certificate verification. Also, a proposal for certificate caching was made to mitigate the risk for self-signed certificates."
