Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Docker Engine prior to versions 1.8.3 and 1.6.2-CS7 does not use globally unique identifiers when storing image layers. This makes it easier for an attacker to cause a collision and poison the image cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Non-Globally Unique Identifiers:** The core weakness lies in the use of non-unique identifiers for Docker image layers, which makes a collision attack possible.
*   **Local Graph Poisoning:** An attacker can inject malicious content into the image layer cache.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Image Cache Poisoning:** An attacker can craft a malicious image that, when pulled or pushed, can overwrite existing image layers in the local cache.
*   **Integrity Violation:** This poisoning can lead to the execution of unintended or malicious code when the compromised images are used.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Pull Command:** An attacker could distribute a specially crafted Docker image, and when a user executes a `docker pull` command, it would introduce the malicious layers into the local graph.
*   **Push Command:** An attacker could push a crafted image to a registry. Then if a user pulls this image, they would be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Modify Docker Images:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify Docker images in order to include malicious layer IDs.
*   **Access to a Registry or Distribution Method:** The attacker needs some method to distribute the crafted image, such as access to a public or private registry, or other distribution methods.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must pull the malicious image for the poisoning to occur, indicating that they must perform an action using the Docker engine.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as a "collision attack" due to the non-unique IDs that may cause an overwrite of the local cache.
*   The SUSE bugzilla entry (949660) and security advisories confirm the fix by updating to Docker 1.8.3.
*   The provided information indicates a "moderate" severity on openSUSE, and "important" on SUSE.

In summary, CVE-2014-8178 highlights a vulnerability in Docker's layer storage mechanism, where non-unique identifiers make it possible to poison the local cache with malicious image layers. This can be exploited by attackers who have the ability to craft images and distribute them, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code in environments using the poisoned images.
