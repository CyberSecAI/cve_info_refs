{
  "CVE-2014-8271": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Reclaim function within the Tianocore UEFI implementation.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Buffer overflow in the Reclaim function.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker may be able to perform an arbitrary reflash of the platform firmware and escalate privileges or perform a denial of service attack by rendering the system inoperable. The consequences and exploitability will vary based on the specific firmware implementation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker with the ability to modify the SPI flash to introduce valid variable headers after the end of the variable storage area.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs a separate vulnerability that allows them to modify the SPI flash to introduce valid variable headers after the end of the variable storage area. They also require local access to the system."
