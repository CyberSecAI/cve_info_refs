Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `label_ids` parameter, used to filter issues by labels, is directly concatenated into an SQL `LIKE` clause without proper escaping or use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to the insecure construction of the SQL query using user-supplied data in the `labelIds` parameter. The application uses string concatenation, making it possible to inject SQL code.
*   **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The code uses string concatenation to build SQL queries instead of prepared statements, which would prevent SQL injection by treating user input as data rather than executable code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to mitigate the vulnerability by splitting the input on commas, but does not fully prevent injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, potentially leading to a full compromise.
*   **System Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration, it might be possible to compromise the underlying system hosting the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via the web interface.
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The `labels` parameter in the URL (e.g., `/<username>/<repository>/issues?labels=...`) is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Gogs instance.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `models/issue.go` in the `GetIssues` function, specifically in the following block:

    ```go
    if len(labelIds) > 0 {
        for _, label := range strings.Split(labelIds, ",") {
            sess.And("label_ids like '%$" + label + "|%'")
        }
    }
    ```
*   The fix implemented in commit `83283bca4cb4e0f4ec48a28af680f0d88db3d2c8` adds a check if the label is a number and sanitizes the input.
    ```go
    if len(labelIds) > 0 {
        for _, label := range strings.Split(labelIds, ",") {
            // Prevent SQL inject.
            if com.StrTo(label).MustInt() > 0 {
                sess.And("label_ids like '%$" + label + "|%'")
            }
        }
    }
    ```
*   The advisory also recommends using prepared statements as a more robust solution:

    ```go
    sess.And("label_ids like ?", "%$" + label + "|%")
    ```

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.5.6.1025. Versions from v0.3.1-9-g49dc57e to v0.5.6.1024-gf1d8746 are affected.
*   The exploit technique involves injecting SQL code through the `label` parameter of the issue filter view.
*   A proof of concept is provided to test for the vulnerability by checking the length of the database version string.

**Additional Details:**

*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:P).
*   The vulnerability was reported by Timo Schmid.
*   The vendor was informed on 2014-09-25, and the fix was implemented on 2014-10-25. The CVE-ID was assigned on 2014-11-14.
