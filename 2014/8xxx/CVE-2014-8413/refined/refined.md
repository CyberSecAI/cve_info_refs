- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Asterisk module `res_pjsip_acl` fails to create and apply Access Control Lists (ACLs) defined in `pjsip.conf` during startup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to load and apply ACLs, which are designed to reject SIP requests from specific hosts, results in unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote unauthenticated sessions may be established by hosts that should be blocked by the configured ACLs.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote unauthenticated SIP requests can bypass the ACL restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to send SIP requests to the affected Asterisk instance from a host that should be blocked by an ACL.
