| **CVE Name** | CVE-2014-8413 |

| **Description** | The Asterisk module res\_pjsip\_acl provides the ability to configure ACLs that may be used to reject SIP requests from various hosts. In affected versions of Asterisk, this module fails to create and apply ACLs defined in pjsip.conf. This may be worked around by reloading res\_pjsip manually after res\_pjsip\_acl is loaded. |

| **Resolution** | The PJSIP ACL code has been changed to create and apply the ACLs properly at startup. |
