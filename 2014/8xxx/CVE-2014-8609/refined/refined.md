{
  "Root cause": "The Android Settings application leaks a PendingIntent with a blank base intent (neither component nor action explicitly set) to third-party applications when adding a new account. This allows a malicious app to use this PendingIntent to broadcast intents with the same permissions and identity as the Settings application (which runs as SYSTEM uid).",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The Settings app creates a PendingIntent using getBroadcast without specifying an explicit component or action.",
    "The PendingIntent is then passed to other applications through the addAccountOptions Bundle.",
    "The receiving application can then modify the Intent within the PendingIntent and send it with elevated privileges."
  ],
  "Impact": "A malicious application can leverage this vulnerability to perform privileged operations, such as: - Sending arbitrary SMS messages (e.g., phishing attacks). - Forcing a factory reset, causing data loss. - Potentially other actions limited only by the permissions of the Settings application.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious application can register as an account authenticator and then request the Settings application to add a new account of the malicious app's type. The Settings app will create the vulnerable PendingIntent and send it to the malicious app.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": [
    "The attacker needs to be able to install an application on the device.",
    "The malicious app needs to register as an account authenticator.",
     "The malicious app needs to be able to call the Settings app's add account activity."
  ],
  "Additional Details": "This vulnerability affects Android versions prior to 5.0 (and possibly 4.0 and higher). It is related to Android bug id 17356824 and was fixed in Android 5.0. The vulnerability was discovered by WangTao, WangYu, and Zhang Donghui of Baidu X-Team."
