Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) handles sessions when using either a database (db) or memcached session engine. Every request to the login page, even by unauthenticated users, triggers the creation of a new session record in the backend. This is due to how Django and the `django_openstack_auth` library interacts with sessions. Specifically, accessing `request.session` or `request.user` will create a new session record even if it eventually fails (such as if the session key is missing). Furthermore the `clear` method used when logging out, would set modified to true and thus persist the session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unnecessary Session Creation:**  The core weakness is that unauthenticated requests to the login page result in the creation of new session records, which can be exploited to create many unwanted backend session entries.
*   **Django Session Handling:** Django's default session handling, particularly with db and memcached backends, automatically generates session records upon initial access, even if the user is not authenticated, and if the user fails authentication or does not have a previous session.
*   **Cookie Handling:** The issue is compounded by the fact that even if a user attempts to log in and fails, a session cookie will still be set.
*   **Logout Session Handling:** Django will also try to modify a session during logout of a user, which would generate a new session record.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could send repeated requests to the Horizon login page, causing a large number of unwanted session records to be created. This excessive creation of sessions can lead to a denial of service by overwhelming the backend, either database or memcached. This impacts the availability of the application, rendering it unusable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker sending multiple requests to the Horizon login page.
*   **Automated Scripts:** An attacker can easily automate this attack using simple scripts that send repeated requests to the login page.
*   **Load Balancer Health Checks:** Even legitimate activities like load balancer health checks could inadvertently trigger this vulnerability if they are not configured to avoid hitting the login page directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Horizon login page.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or user credentials.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to send basic HTTP requests, which can be easily achieved.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Horizon setups using either the db or memcached session engine. Setups using cookie-based sessions are not vulnerable
*   Patches were created and backported for master/kilo, stable/juno, and stable/icehouse branches of Horizon.
*   The fixes include changes to the middleware and how sessions are handled within the `django_openstack_auth` library.
*   The patch to django\_openstack\_auth removes the `flush()` call during authentication failures to avoid new session creation.
*   The horizon patch includes changes to delay access to the session until authentication. In addition, a new middleware is added to the process\_response to clear out session cookies on unauthenticated requests.
*   Red Hat product errata RHSA-2015:0839 and RHSA-2015:0845 address this vulnerability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for RHEL 7 and 6 respectively.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable and coordinated by the OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team.
