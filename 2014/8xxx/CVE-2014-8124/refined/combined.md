How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2015:0839 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-django-horizon and python-django-openstack-auth update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0839)

## Topic

Updated python-django-horizon and python-django-openstack-auth packages
that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

A denial of service flaw was found in the OpenStack Dashboard (horizon)
when using the db or memcached session engine. An attacker could make
repeated requests to the login page, which would result in a large number
of unwanted backend session entries, possibly leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2014-8124)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable as the original
reporter.

The python-django-horizon packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version,
including:

* Default 'target={}' value leaks into subsequent 'policy.check()' calls.
* Neutron subnet create tooltip has invalid HTML tags.
* Memory reported improperly in admin dashboard.
* The container dashboard does not handle unicode URL correctly.

(BZ#1203281)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The option 'OPENSTACK\_SSL\_NO\_VERIFY' is used to enable or disable checks

for SSL certificate validity. Prior to this update, swift clients ignored
this check. As a result, you could not use horizon with swift, and swift
was accessed via a self signed certificate. With this update, the option is
now handled properly and Horizon is able to use this endpoint while the
'OPENSTACK\_SSL\_NO\_VERIFY' option is enabled. (BZ#1192517)

* Previously, horizon.log was not truncated automatically, resulting in

very large log files. With this update, files are now trimmed by logrotate,
fixing this issue. (BZ#1112621)

All OpenStack Dashboard users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 for RHEL 7 runs on Red Hat

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 April 2015
* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016

### Bug Description

We have horizon deployed with mysql sessions. I believe this issue exists with all db backed sessions, and likely memchached too (but I am not sure).

Every request to the login page is generating a new session record in the db. This is based upon this line of code:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py#L41>

What happens is as soon as you access request.session['foo'] then you are going to get an entry in the db.

I have placed some debugging code in a variety of locations where we are accessing the session store before we should be, which creates these records:

<https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/horizon/middleware.py#L94>

The check for the timeout should never occur if there is no authenticated user. So the check a few lines below needs to be moved higher.

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L50>

This check I am not sure how to work around. We are accessing the session, which creates records, just trying to keep track if a user is logged in or not. It seems like we are not using the django auth mechanisms correctly here, and I can't see if there is a workaround.

Thanks for the report. This sounds like a bug with potencial security consequence, so I've added an incomplete security advisory task and subscribed Horizon's core security reviewers to comment.

How many extraneous sessions are created that could have been avoided ?

There is one session created for each request to horizon. So if you created a script to perform a bunch of curl requests to horizon, each curl requests gets a record in the db.

I found this with load balancer health checks, which occur fairly frequently. We had about 1,000 records within an hour for each instance of horizon for a conservative load balancer check. If I wanted to, I would expect I could create many more than this.

If I add extra django settings to cap the cookie age and a cron job to clean up these records, it is possible to somewhat limit the severity of what impact such health checks have so that the number does not grow much past our 1,000 per horizon instance. However, if a user wants to be malicious there is really a high ceiling of damage that can be done (especially with default settings from horizon and django).

For the service health check, it would probably be better to create a separate page that doesn't call set\_test\_cookie() method as describe here: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17098142/django-session-created-in-database-when-login-page-loaded?lq=1>

We can add that separate page in Horizon that is used just to check if Horizon is serving pages. Thoughts?

To summarize, seems there are three issue here that causes session to be created in the login page:

1. setting user object in the request:

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L50>

Once the request.user is accessed it will trigger a read on the SESSION for the session\_key to get the user\_id, then from the user\_id fetch it in the backend. Seems like there is no way around checking if there is an authenticated user or not without hitting a read on the Session.

2. middleware that check session timeout: <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/horizon/middleware.py#L94>

Even if we moved the check for authenticated user before timeout checking, this will still create a session because the middleware is going to call request.user.is\_authenticated() - see #1.

3. set\_test\_cookie and session clear: <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/openstack_dashboard/views.py#L45>

set\_test\_cookie is getting deprecated in the Login form for Django 1.7. It is suggested to just use CSRF protected view. We have a CSRF middleware that does a blanket protection on all pages, perhaps we can just remove it?

Django 1.7 deprecation notes (<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/deprecation/>): "The undocumented check\_for\_test\_cookie method in AuthenticationForm will be removed following an accelerated deprecation. Users subclassing this form should remove calls to this method, and instead ensure that their auth related views are CSRF protected, which ensures that cookies are enabled."

Even if we fix #3, we still have the same problem due to #1 and #2. I think any application can be targetted with DOS attack by just sending too many requests from a malicious attacker. For example other services have rate limiting in place to prevent that, it would be up to the operator to put the security in place to detect the attack.

I am not sure if we can really do anything about it, other than providing a health check page that won't create sessions everytime it is hit.

There is no need to create the session for unauthenticated requests.

The patch looks good to me. I think there is a potential need for a health check URL, but that seems to be a greater OpenStack need to arrive at a consistent mechanism for doing health checks.

Thanks David for confirming the bug on Horizon project!

Now for the OSSA part, should we keep this under embargo and does this qualify as a DOS attack vector ?

Considering there is no amplification and that one connection results in one database entry I would triage this as class D bug (according to our new taxonomy described here: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management#Incident_report_taxonomy> )...

Thought ?

This bug can be trivially used to knock over any existing production deployment of Horizon that doesn't use cookie-based sessions.

There is no amplification, but I suspect I can break most production deployments to the point that fixing requires manual intervention in less than 30 minutes. I'd prefer not to make that public without also providing a fix.

I'd argue we should probably treat that as A or B1.

Apparently that bug lets you fill the DB much faster than expected. Thus we'll threat this as a class A.

The proposed patch apply cleanly on master and juno branch but it requires a bit of rework for Icehouse. Can someone provide a patch for Icehouse ?

Here is the proposed impact description #1. Note that I've considered all backends as vulnerable:

Title: Horizon denial of service attack through login page

Reporter: Eric Peterson (Time Warner Cable)

Products: Horizon

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2

Description:

Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By doing repeated requests to Horizon login page a remote attacker may generate unwanted session record resulting in a denial of service. All Horizon setups are affected.

With the added check for:

if settings.SESSION\_COOKIE\_NAME in request.COOKIES:

an attacker can easily set some fake cookie with the specified name, and will go through the session.create() anyway.

Regarding the get\_user monkey patch - since we use external auth system(Keystone), we can't use the Django UserId, so we need to store Keystone User Id and SessionBackend in session, to create user from it.

One possible solution is to clean the session on line 59:

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L59>

But this way - although we will keep clear the database, we might end up with DOS vulnerability for the CREATE-DELETE DB requests on each anonymous request.

Another way is to monkey patch the load() method of SessionStore to avoid creation of a new session, since we do not use the session for anonymous requests.

If you get into the auth layer of the code and are assigning users to the request, that will create a session record no matter what (from what I have seen). In addition, I do not believe it is the responsibility of the auth package to perform maintenance on the session backend.

It is a very good point that the attacker could add a local cookie to try to fake out a valid session. However, the attacker would need to know the name of the session cookie id (which we could change I suppose from the default) and they would also have to keep on generating new session ids for each request. This is not a difficult task for an attacker, but it does become harder to attack with this approach.

The other part of this is that we need to add the config setting for:

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-SESSION_COOKIE_AGE>

If we make this setting something more reasonably close to a typical keystone token lifespan, this issue becomes less severe. This setting can be combined with a cron job to run:

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-clearsessions>

So if a keystone token is typically generated with a 1 hour lifespan, setting the cookie age to 1 hr and running the cron job every hour keeps the db as clean as possible.

(something like the info above might need to be included in a bug disclosure)

The horizon fix seems ok / good, but there is likely some DOA fixes to help improve this issue as well.

@Eric Well the attack vector remains if adding a fake cookie trigger the extra session creation.

And the one hour timeout proposed seems to big according to comment #13 assumption where only 1/2 hours is required to overwhelm the service...

How about the monkey patch of SessionStore.load method, wouldn't it be easer to implement ?

@Tristan - I am a bit cautious to say that the SessionStore.load() method should be monkey patched. The concerning part is that the session store can be customized during deployment. Historically signed cookies have been used a lot, which do not suffer from this problem. In addition, I am not confident how many session stores have this issue or not. Finally, I think this issue is not new to Django, and they seem to have this behavior deliberately. It could be that changing this behavior could cause an even worse side effect (but honestly I do not know).

I think the patch thus far at least makes it so a simple curl script for the login page will not overwhelm the db. This is a good first step.

What Tihomir and I discussed via IRC was that we could probably make changes to the django-openstack-auth repo that would further improve things and reduce the likelihood of creating new sessions. Those changes are not complete at this point and will require some more work.

@Eric alright, sadly I suspect Paul's comment #13 to be still valid (considering the attack only need an extra crafted cookie).

In order to threat this as a Class A, we need a fix that really mitigate the attack for all supported release...

FYI, the other options are:

\* fix this publicly (might help to get a patch in).

\* threat this as a B2 class type of bug (which mean fix and/or security note).

How long do you think it will take to have such a fix covering django-openstack-auth ?

I have not found a way to make changes in the auth package that prevent session creation. As soon as a user is looked up (even an Anonymous user), a session record is created.

However, I have found an additional change in the horizon middleware can help. This change is needed in process\_response, at the end of the method. This means it is one of the last things called. The code to add is:

if not request.user.is\_authenticated():

            request.session.delete(request.session.session\_key)

For a db backed session, this calls:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py#L70>

I am not sure how this works with the signed cookie base sessions, or even in the memcached sessions. Would this be an acceptable approach?

I just looked at signed cookies, cached, and cached db session backends. They all have a delete method with this signature. I \*think\* this should technically work.

Thanks Eric for looking at the code. I promised to try to prepare the Django Auth patch, but couldn't manage to do it, sorry for that. Anyway - the proposed fix with process\_response seems much more correct than the django-auth approach, as we might accidentally add some additional processing in another middleware, to check again for something in the session, and clearing the session at process\_response seems to be the better way.

In Django, the persistence of SessionID in the Server(DB) is needed if we want to allow anonymous users to store some settings in session and not in cookie(e.g. when editing a comment under a blog - store drafts in the server session while the user is not yet logged in). Since Horizon doesn't allow anonymous users to any action, I think clearing the session is actually recommended. Each time anonymous user logs in the site - they will have unique session id, which is perfectly fine - they don't need anything else.

If someone can help with testing the proposed patch By Eric ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1394370/+attachment/4264463/+files/0001-Horizon-login-page-contains-DOS-attack-mechanism.patch](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1394370/%2Battachment/4264463/%2Bfiles/0001-Horizon-login-page-contains-DOS-attack-mechanism.patch)) + the last 2 lines with process\_response - should be great. I'd try to run few tests, but I'm on a very tight schedule this week.

  [Edit](/horizon/%2Bbug/1394370/%2Battachment/4269055)
  (5.0 KiB,
  text/plain)

Here is the updated patch, containing the request.session.delete(request.session.session\_key) code in process\_response, but in a different middleware class.

Since we have this code in Django: <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/middleware.py#L49> the SessionMiddleware tries to save the session in case it is modified, and this is the case when logout is called for a logged in session. Since the user was logged in, then logged out, the session is marked as modified. The problem here is the order of execution of the middlewares - the SessionMiddleware is being executed after the HorizonMiddleware, so if we first try to clear/delete the session in HorizonMiddleware, then the SessionMiddleware processes the response, detects that is has been modified and tries to save it. This creates a new record in the DB with the sessionId of the logged-out user. So we need to process the response after the SessionMiddleware, so the proposed change is to add a CleanupMiddleware, that does the cleanup.

I've tested with signed\_cookies and db - no visible drawbacks or problems. The tables seems clear after several logins, logouts, clean browser sessions.

A positive side-effect of the patch: no session cookie is being set in the response for anonymous users. In the current codebase - after an unsuccessful login, a cookie with the session\_id is being returned to the users, thus exposing the SESSION\_COOKIE\_NAME to the user even if they don't have a valid account for the system. Now - until the user logs in for first time - no session cookie is being returned. When the users logs out - the Session cookie is being removed from response, so browser seems clear.

So here's my take:

1. A session is only saved if session.modified is true: <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/middleware.py#L18>

2. django-openstack-auth is doing the same type of access in get\_user as the default django database backend. Compare <https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L51> and <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/__init__.py#L147>

3. I agree that the session clear and set\_test\_cookie are no longer needed; that's legacy code. I also agree that our call to \_check\_has\_timed\_timeout should be after checking if the user is authenticated.

What all this means is that simply \*accessing\* the session is not enough to write it to the DB; somewhere in these code paths we're triggering the session.modified flag. We should instead focus on finding where that's happening and ensure that we do not do anything to modify the session for anonymous sessions.

That would be a more appropriate fix for this as opposed to mucking with checking for a specific cookie name and/or deleting sessions if they're "unused".

I haven't read the entire ticket, however if this is your login view: <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/openstack_dashboard/views.py#L38-L48> then that's your problem right there. The request.session.clear() deletes the session and sets modified=True so it will create a new session.

I would recommend just flat out deleting that session manipulation code there. The Django login code already will ensure that session keys are rotated on authentication boundaries without creating a new session on every page load so the clearing of the session doesn't really do much of anything there. Setting the test cookie I don't think will hurt anything but I don't think you need it either TBH.

Note that accessing request.user does \*not\* create a session ever with Django. It will access the session yes, but it won't modify it and you require a modification to save a session (and thus create one if one doesn't already exist) unless you have SESSION\_SAVE\_EVERY\_REQUEST set to True.

This is the clear code in Django -> <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py#L137-L143>

It makes sense for the clear code to mark the session as modified because what's it's doing is emptying the session of all data, but it keeps the same session id.

Here's the login code in Django by the way as well -> <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/__init__.py#L77-L105>

It's acutally careful not to clear the session data when going from anonymous -> logged in, but to ensure that it does clear the session data when going from logged in (or thinks it's logged in) -> logged in with a different user.

Note that accessing request.user does \*not\* create a session ever with Django. It will access the session yes, but it won't modify it and you require a modification to save a session (and thus create one if one doesn't already exist) unless you have SESSION\_SAVE\_EVERY\_REQUEST set to True.
This is the clear code in Django -> https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py#L137-L143
It makes sense for the clear code to mark the session as modified because what's it's doing is emptying the session of all data, but it keeps the same session id.

A session record will get written to the DB if you:

- Just access (read from) request.session

- Just access request.user (which underneath, is also accessing request.session)

A good general intro is at <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4444758/huge-django-session-table-normal-behaviour-or-bug>

The db session backend is forcing a session row to be created at:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py#L29>

This essentially is saying if we couldn't find any session info, the db backend will generate a session ID for the user and write a row into the DB.

I agree that this in't a great behavior, but it is what I observe in a lot of trial and error tests.

@dstufft - yes, I would think accessing request.user wouldn't create a new session row, but that is not the case. When this code happens:

user\_id = request.session[SESSION\_KEY]

Then the session gets created in the db, even though that code will eventually bomb out with a key error for the SESSION\_KEY.

I'd encourage others to set this stuff up and try it, how I would think things should work are not how things actually work ;) within django's session middleware.

I take back what I said above, I think I found another spot that was making session changes too.

I will have a simpler patch soon. Thanks all for your input (and patience :)).

Blugh. That should probably be changed in Django. There's no reason to create a session until one is being saved.

The session.clear() should still be dropped because even if the fixes land in Django then that will still cause a session to be created on each page load.

This patch is a simplified version of previous patches, and catches one more cookie modification we were making - which lead to extra session records.

I hope this is just about the last patch.

The latest patch is still vulnerable, just make

csrf=$(curl <https://dashboard> | grep csrfmiddlewaretoken-match-pattern)

Then run this request:

curl -i <https://dashboard/auth/login/> -d "csrfmiddlewaretoken=$csrf&region=[http://dashboard:5000/v2.0&username=fake&password=fake](http://dashboard:5000/v2.0%26username%3Dfake%26password%3Dfake)" -b csrftoken=$csrf

You can repeat the request as many times as you want. Each run will add new row in DB.

But I think mystery is finally revealed:

First this:

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/455aaeab8d16fbecebe9a088e10e0e532a3116cb/openstack_auth/forms.py#L101>

and then that:

Django 1.7:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py#L276>

Django 1.6 (Ouch):

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.6.x/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py>

So .flush() should be replaced with .delete(session\_key), as in 1.6 it calls .create() and in 1.7 .clear() sets self.modified = True, but we don't have anything in session anyway.

My assumption is that Django wants to persist session, as by default websites might need to store user settings for anonymous users. Also, the sessionId is persisted for security reasons - since the session\_key value is primary key in the Database, you cannot create duplicate sessionIds. Otherwise - if one user logs in and is assigned sessionId=123, then another user plays as anonymous, but for some reason the server assigns the same sessionId(possible in web farms) - they will be able to see the same as the logged-in user.

But Horizon doesn't actually need that. It doesn't offer anything to anonymous users. So Django should be probably able to handle the case with no anonymous sessions in DB as a general use case.

One minor drawback of the patch is that after a logout, a new session id is associated to the user, and it remains in the DB. But this should be generally OK for handling. To clear it - we still need the cleanup middleware.

The patch issues .delete() in django\_openstack\_auth, which works in 1.6 and 1.7 - no database rows added. And we can add the latest patch from Eric for horizon, as it makes things simple.

Ouch - Django master is 1.8 alpha, so the both 1.6 and 1.7 issue .create() at the end of flush(). But all versions call clear() which sets .modified = True.

Awesome find Tihomir, I wonder if we just removed the flush altogether - if that would fix it perhaps? I am not sure why it is there in the first place.

Eric is right, no need to flush/delete the session. Tested - no rows in DB without the .flush() line.

(minor clarification)

I am not sure all Horizon setups are affected - I would say that Horizon setups using a db or memcached session engine would be impacted.

The default Horizon setting has been signed cookies in many cases, which does not suffer from this issue. (I am not sure which distros use signed cookies and which ones do not).

Horizon login page contains DOS attack mechanism

the horizon login page (really the middleware) accesses the session

    too early in the login process, which will create session records

    in the session backend. This is especially problematic when non-cookie

    backends are used.

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-040
CVE: CVE-2014-8124
Date: December 09, 2014
Title: Horizon denial of service attack through login page
Reporter: Eric Peterson (Time Warner Cable)
Products: Horizon
Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2 version up to 2014.2.1

Description:
Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable reported a vulnerability in
Horizon. By making repeated requests to the Horizon login page a remote
attacker may generate unwanted session records, potentially resulting in
a denial of service. Only Horizon setups using a db or memcached session
engine are affected.

Kilo (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/140353>

Juno fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/140358>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/140356>

django_openstack_auth fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/140352>

Notes:
This fix will be included in future 2014.1.3 and 2014.2.1 releases.
The django_openstack_auth Horizon dependency requires the additional
patch above.

## Synopsis

Moderate: python-django-horizon and python-django-openstack-auth update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0845)

## Topic

Updated python-django-horizon and python-django-openstack-auth packages
that fix one security issue and multiple bugs are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical
interface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.
The dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the
size and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal
to provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.

A denial of service flaw was found in the OpenStack Dashboard (horizon)
when using the db or memcached session engine. An attacker could make
repeated requests to the login page, which would result in a large number
of unwanted backend session entries, possibly leading to a denial of
service. (CVE-2014-8124)

Red Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.
Upstream acknowledges Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable as the original
reporter.

The python-django-horizon packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version,
including:

* Default 'target={}' value leaks into subsequent 'policy.check()' calls.
* Neutron subnet create tooltip has invalid HTML tags.
* Memory reported improperly in admin dashboard.
* The container dashboard does not handle unicode URL correctly.

(BZ#1203281)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The option 'OPENSTACK\_SSL\_NO\_VERIFY' is used to enable or disable checks

for SSL certificate validity. Prior to this update, swift clients ignored
this check. As a result, you could not use horizon with swift, and swift
was accessed via a self signed certificate. With this update, the option is
now handled properly and Horizon is able to use this endpoint while the
'OPENSTACK\_SSL\_NO\_VERIFY' option is enabled. (BZ#1192517)

* Previously, horizon.log was not truncated automatically, resulting in

very large log files. With this update, files are now trimmed by logrotate,
fixing this issue. (BZ#1112621)

All OpenStack Dashboard users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 runs on Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6.6.

The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5 Release Notes (see
References section) contain the following:

* An explanation of the way in which the provided components interact to

form a working cloud computing environment.

* Technology Previews, Recommended Practices, and Known Issues.
* The channels required for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5,

including which channels need to be enabled and disabled.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

### Bug Description

We have horizon deployed with mysql sessions. I believe this issue exists with all db backed sessions, and likely memchached too (but I am not sure).

Every request to the login page is generating a new session record in the db. This is based upon this line of code:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py#L41>

What happens is as soon as you access request.session['foo'] then you are going to get an entry in the db.

I have placed some debugging code in a variety of locations where we are accessing the session store before we should be, which creates these records:

<https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/horizon/middleware.py#L94>

The check for the timeout should never occur if there is no authenticated user. So the check a few lines below needs to be moved higher.

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L50>

This check I am not sure how to work around. We are accessing the session, which creates records, just trying to keep track if a user is logged in or not. It seems like we are not using the django auth mechanisms correctly here, and I can't see if there is a workaround.

Thanks for the report. This sounds like a bug with potencial security consequence, so I've added an incomplete security advisory task and subscribed Horizon's core security reviewers to comment.

How many extraneous sessions are created that could have been avoided ?

There is one session created for each request to horizon. So if you created a script to perform a bunch of curl requests to horizon, each curl requests gets a record in the db.

I found this with load balancer health checks, which occur fairly frequently. We had about 1,000 records within an hour for each instance of horizon for a conservative load balancer check. If I wanted to, I would expect I could create many more than this.

If I add extra django settings to cap the cookie age and a cron job to clean up these records, it is possible to somewhat limit the severity of what impact such health checks have so that the number does not grow much past our 1,000 per horizon instance. However, if a user wants to be malicious there is really a high ceiling of damage that can be done (especially with default settings from horizon and django).

For the service health check, it would probably be better to create a separate page that doesn't call set\_test\_cookie() method as describe here: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17098142/django-session-created-in-database-when-login-page-loaded?lq=1>

We can add that separate page in Horizon that is used just to check if Horizon is serving pages. Thoughts?

To summarize, seems there are three issue here that causes session to be created in the login page:

1. setting user object in the request:

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L50>

Once the request.user is accessed it will trigger a read on the SESSION for the session\_key to get the user\_id, then from the user\_id fetch it in the backend. Seems like there is no way around checking if there is an authenticated user or not without hitting a read on the Session.

2. middleware that check session timeout: <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/horizon/middleware.py#L94>

Even if we moved the check for authenticated user before timeout checking, this will still create a session because the middleware is going to call request.user.is\_authenticated() - see #1.

3. set\_test\_cookie and session clear: <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/openstack_dashboard/views.py#L45>

set\_test\_cookie is getting deprecated in the Login form for Django 1.7. It is suggested to just use CSRF protected view. We have a CSRF middleware that does a blanket protection on all pages, perhaps we can just remove it?

Django 1.7 deprecation notes (<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/deprecation/>): "The undocumented check\_for\_test\_cookie method in AuthenticationForm will be removed following an accelerated deprecation. Users subclassing this form should remove calls to this method, and instead ensure that their auth related views are CSRF protected, which ensures that cookies are enabled."

Even if we fix #3, we still have the same problem due to #1 and #2. I think any application can be targetted with DOS attack by just sending too many requests from a malicious attacker. For example other services have rate limiting in place to prevent that, it would be up to the operator to put the security in place to detect the attack.

I am not sure if we can really do anything about it, other than providing a health check page that won't create sessions everytime it is hit.

There is no need to create the session for unauthenticated requests.

The patch looks good to me. I think there is a potential need for a health check URL, but that seems to be a greater OpenStack need to arrive at a consistent mechanism for doing health checks.

Thanks David for confirming the bug on Horizon project!

Now for the OSSA part, should we keep this under embargo and does this qualify as a DOS attack vector ?

Considering there is no amplification and that one connection results in one database entry I would triage this as class D bug (according to our new taxonomy described here: <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Vulnerability_Management#Incident_report_taxonomy> )...

Thought ?

This bug can be trivially used to knock over any existing production deployment of Horizon that doesn't use cookie-based sessions.

There is no amplification, but I suspect I can break most production deployments to the point that fixing requires manual intervention in less than 30 minutes. I'd prefer not to make that public without also providing a fix.

I'd argue we should probably treat that as A or B1.

Apparently that bug lets you fill the DB much faster than expected. Thus we'll threat this as a class A.

The proposed patch apply cleanly on master and juno branch but it requires a bit of rework for Icehouse. Can someone provide a patch for Icehouse ?

Here is the proposed impact description #1. Note that I've considered all backends as vulnerable:

Title: Horizon denial of service attack through login page

Reporter: Eric Peterson (Time Warner Cable)

Products: Horizon

Versions: up to 2014.1.3 and 2014.2

Description:

Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By doing repeated requests to Horizon login page a remote attacker may generate unwanted session record resulting in a denial of service. All Horizon setups are affected.

With the added check for:

if settings.SESSION\_COOKIE\_NAME in request.COOKIES:

an attacker can easily set some fake cookie with the specified name, and will go through the session.create() anyway.

Regarding the get\_user monkey patch - since we use external auth system(Keystone), we can't use the Django UserId, so we need to store Keystone User Id and SessionBackend in session, to create user from it.

One possible solution is to clean the session on line 59:

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L59>

But this way - although we will keep clear the database, we might end up with DOS vulnerability for the CREATE-DELETE DB requests on each anonymous request.

Another way is to monkey patch the load() method of SessionStore to avoid creation of a new session, since we do not use the session for anonymous requests.

If you get into the auth layer of the code and are assigning users to the request, that will create a session record no matter what (from what I have seen). In addition, I do not believe it is the responsibility of the auth package to perform maintenance on the session backend.

It is a very good point that the attacker could add a local cookie to try to fake out a valid session. However, the attacker would need to know the name of the session cookie id (which we could change I suppose from the default) and they would also have to keep on generating new session ids for each request. This is not a difficult task for an attacker, but it does become harder to attack with this approach.

The other part of this is that we need to add the config setting for:

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-SESSION_COOKIE_AGE>

If we make this setting something more reasonably close to a typical keystone token lifespan, this issue becomes less severe. This setting can be combined with a cron job to run:

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-clearsessions>

So if a keystone token is typically generated with a 1 hour lifespan, setting the cookie age to 1 hr and running the cron job every hour keeps the db as clean as possible.

(something like the info above might need to be included in a bug disclosure)

The horizon fix seems ok / good, but there is likely some DOA fixes to help improve this issue as well.

@Eric Well the attack vector remains if adding a fake cookie trigger the extra session creation.

@Eric Well the attack vector remains if adding a fake cookie trigger the extra session creation.

@Tristan - I am a bit cautious to say that the SessionStore.load() method should be monkey patched. The concerning part is that the session store can be customized during deployment. Historically signed cookies have been used a lot, which do not suffer from this problem. In addition, I am not confident how many session stores have this issue or not. Finally, I think this issue is not new to Django, and they seem to have this behavior deliberately. It could be that changing this behavior could cause an even worse side effect (but honestly I do not know).

I think the patch thus far at least makes it so a simple curl script for the login page will not overwhelm the db. This is a good first step.

What Tihomir and I discussed via IRC was that we could probably make changes to the django-openstack-auth repo that would further improve things and reduce the likelihood of creating new sessions. Those changes are not complete at this point and will require some more work.

@Eric alright, sadly I suspect Paul's comment #13 to be still valid (considering the attack only need an extra crafted cookie).

In order to threat this as a Class A, we need a fix that really mitigate the attack for all supported release...

FYI, the other options are:

\* fix this publicly (might help to get a patch in).

\* threat this as a B2 class type of bug (which mean fix and/or security note).

How long do you think it will take to have such a fix covering django-openstack-auth ?

I have not found a way to make changes in the auth package that prevent session creation. As soon as a user is looked up (even an Anonymous user), a session record is created.

However, I have found an additional change in the horizon middleware can help. This change is needed in process\_response, at the end of the method. This means it is one of the last things called. The code to add is:

if not request.user.is\_authenticated():

            request.session.delete(request.session.session\_key)

For a db backed session, this calls:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py#L70>

I am not sure how this works with the signed cookie base sessions, or even in the memcached sessions. Would this be an acceptable approach?

I just looked at signed cookies, cached, and cached db session backends. They all have a delete method with this signature. I \*think\* this should technically work.

Thanks Eric for looking at the code. I promised to try to prepare the Django Auth patch, but couldn't manage to do it, sorry for that. Anyway - the proposed fix with process\_response seems much more correct than the django-auth approach, as we might accidentally add some additional processing in another middleware, to check again for something in the session, and clearing the session at process\_response seems to be the better way.

In Django, the persistence of SessionID in the Server(DB) is needed if we want to allow anonymous users to store some settings in session and not in cookie(e.g. when editing a comment under a blog - store drafts in the server session while the user is not yet logged in). Since Horizon doesn't allow anonymous users to any action, I think clearing the session is actually recommended. Each time anonymous user logs in the site - they will have unique session id, which is perfectly fine - they don't need anything else.

If someone can help with testing the proposed patch By Eric ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1394370/+attachment/4264463/+files/0001-Horizon-login-page-contains-DOS-attack-mechanism.patch](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1394370/%2Battachment/4264463/%2Bfiles/0001-Horizon-login-page-contains-DOS-attack-mechanism.patch)) + the last 2 lines with process\_response - should be great. I'd try to run few tests, but I'm on a very tight schedule this week.

Here is the updated patch, containing the request.session.delete(request.session.session\_key) code in process\_response, but in a different middleware class.

Since we have this code in Django: <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/middleware.py#L49> the SessionMiddleware tries to save the session in case it is modified, and this is the case when logout is called for a logged in session. Since the user was logged in, then logged out, the session is marked as modified. The problem here is the order of execution of the middlewares - the SessionMiddleware is being executed after the HorizonMiddleware, so if we first try to clear/delete the session in HorizonMiddleware, then the SessionMiddleware processes the response, detects that is has been modified and tries to save it. This creates a new record in the DB with the sessionId of the logged-out user. So we need to process the response after the SessionMiddleware, so the proposed change is to add a CleanupMiddleware, that does the cleanup.

I've tested with signed\_cookies and db - no visible drawbacks or problems. The tables seems clear after several logins, logouts, clean browser sessions.

A positive side-effect of the patch: no session cookie is being set in the response for anonymous users. In the current codebase - after an unsuccessful login, a cookie with the session\_id is being returned to the users, thus exposing the SESSION\_COOKIE\_NAME to the user even if they don't have a valid account for the system. Now - until the user logs in for first time - no session cookie is being returned. When the users logs out - the Session cookie is being removed from response, so browser seems clear.

So here's my take:

1. A session is only saved if session.modified is true: <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/middleware.py#L18>

2. django-openstack-auth is doing the same type of access in get\_user as the default django database backend. Compare <https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/master/openstack_auth/utils.py#L51> and <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/__init__.py#L147>

3. I agree that the session clear and set\_test\_cookie are no longer needed; that's legacy code. I also agree that our call to \_check\_has\_timed\_timeout should be after checking if the user is authenticated.

What all this means is that simply \*accessing\* the session is not enough to write it to the DB; somewhere in these code paths we're triggering the session.modified flag. We should instead focus on finding where that's happening and ensure that we do not do anything to modify the session for anonymous sessions.

That would be a more appropriate fix for this as opposed to mucking with checking for a specific cookie name and/or deleting sessions if they're "unused".

I haven't read the entire ticket, however if this is your login view: <https://github.com/openstack/horizon/blob/master/openstack_dashboard/views.py#L38-L48> then that's your problem right there. The request.session.clear() deletes the session and sets modified=True so it will create a new session.

I would recommend just flat out deleting that session manipulation code there. The Django login code already will ensure that session keys are rotated on authentication boundaries without creating a new session on every page load so the clearing of the session doesn't really do much of anything there. Setting the test cookie I don't think will hurt anything but I don't think you need it either TBH.

Note that accessing request.user does \*not\* create a session ever with Django. It will access the session yes, but it won't modify it and you require a modification to save a session (and thus create one if one doesn't already exist) unless you have SESSION\_SAVE\_EVERY\_REQUEST set to True.

This is the clear code in Django -> <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py#L137-L143>

It makes sense for the clear code to mark the session as modified because what's it's doing is emptying the session of all data, but it keeps the same session id.

Here's the login code in Django by the way as well -> <https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/auth/__init__.py#L77-L105>

It's acutally careful not to clear the session data when going from anonymous -> logged in, but to ensure that it does clear the session data when going from logged in (or thinks it's logged in) -> logged in with a different user.

A session record will get written to the DB if you:

- Just access (read from) request.session

- Just access request.user (which underneath, is also accessing request.session)

A good general intro is at <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4444758/huge-django-session-table-normal-behaviour-or-bug>

The db session backend is forcing a session row to be created at:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/db.py#L29>

This essentially is saying if we couldn't find any session info, the db backend will generate a session ID for the user and write a row into the DB.

I agree that this in't a great behavior, but it is what I observe in a lot of trial and error tests.

@dstufft - yes, I would think accessing request.user wouldn't create a new session row, but that is not the case. When this code happens:

user\_id = request.session[SESSION\_KEY]

Then the session gets created in the db, even though that code will eventually bomb out with a key error for the SESSION\_KEY.

I'd encourage others to set this stuff up and try it, how I would think things should work are not how things actually work ;) within django's session middleware.

Blugh. That should probably be changed in Django. There's no reason to create a session until one is being saved.

The session.clear() should still be dropped because even if the fixes land in Django then that will still cause a session to be created on each page load.

This patch is a simplified version of previous patches, and catches one more cookie modification we were making - which lead to extra session records.

I hope this is just about the last patch.

The latest patch is still vulnerable, just make

csrf=$(curl <https://dashboard> | grep csrfmiddlewaretoken-match-pattern)

Then run this request:

curl -i <https://dashboard/auth/login/> -d "csrfmiddlewaretoken=$csrf&region=[http://dashboard:5000/v2.0&username=fake&password=fake](http://dashboard:5000/v2.0%26username%3Dfake%26password%3Dfake)" -b csrftoken=$csrf

You can repeat the request as many times as you want. Each run will add new row in DB.

But I think mystery is finally revealed:

First this:

<https://github.com/openstack/django_openstack_auth/blob/455aaeab8d16fbecebe9a088e10e0e532a3116cb/openstack_auth/forms.py#L101>

and then that:

Django 1.7:

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py#L276>

Django 1.6 (Ouch):

<https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.6.x/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py>

So .flush() should be replaced with .delete(session\_key), as in 1.6 it calls .create() and in 1.7 .clear() sets self.modified = True, but we don't have anything in session anyway.

My assumption is that Django wants to persist session, as by default websites might need to store user settings for anonymous users. Also, the sessionId is persisted for security reasons - since the session\_key value is primary key in the Database, you cannot create duplicate sessionIds. Otherwise - if one user logs in and is assigned sessionId=123, then another user plays as anonymous, but for some reason the server assigns the same sessionId(possible in web farms) - they will be able to see the same as the logged-in user.

But Horizon doesn't actually need that. It doesn't offer anything to anonymous users. So Django should be probably able to handle the case with no anonymous sessions in DB as a general use case.

One minor drawback of the patch is that after a logout, a new session id is associated to the user, and it remains in the DB. But this should be generally OK for handling. To clear it - we still need the cleanup middleware.

The patch issues .delete() in django\_openstack\_auth, which works in 1.6 and 1.7 - no database rows added. And we can add the latest patch from Eric for horizon, as it makes things simple.

The latest patch is still vulnerable, just make
csrf=$(curl https://dashboard | grep csrfmiddlewaretoken-match-pattern)
Then run this request:

You can repeat the request as many times as you want. Each run will add new row in DB.
But I think mystery is finally revealed:
First this:
https://github.com/openstack/django\_openstack\_auth/blob/455aaeab8d16fbecebe9a088e10e0e532a3116cb/openstack\_auth/forms.py#L101
and then that:
Django 1.7:
https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py#L276
Django 1.6 (Ouch):
https://github.com/django/django/blob/stable/1.6.x/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py
So .flush() should be replaced with .delete(session\_key), as in 1.6 it calls .create() and in 1.7 .clear() sets self.modified = True, but we don't have anything in session anyway.
My assumption is that Django wants to persist session, as by default websites might need to store user settings for anonymous users. Also, the sessionId is persisted for security reasons - since the session\_key value is primary key in the Database, you cannot create duplicate sessionIds. Otherwise - if one user logs in and is assigned sessionId=123, then another user plays as anonymous, but for some reason the server assigns the same sessionId(possible in web farms) - they will be able to see the same as the logged-in user.
But Horizon doesn't actually need that. It doesn't offer anything to anonymous users. So Django should be probably able to handle the case with no anonymous sessions in DB as a general use case.
One minor drawback of the patch is that after a logout, a new session id is associated to the user, and it remains in the DB. But this should be generally OK for handling. To clear it - we still need the cleanup middleware.
The patch issues .delete() in django\_openstack\_auth, which works in 1.6 and 1.7 - no database rows added. And we can add the latest patch from Eric for horizon, as it makes things simple.

Ouch - Django master is 1.8 alpha, so the both 1.6 and 1.7 issue .create() at the end of flush(). But all versions call clear() which sets .modified = True.

Awesome find Tihomir, I wonder if we just removed the flush altogether - if that would fix it perhaps? I am not sure why it is there in the first place.

Eric is right, no need to flush/delete the session. Tested - no rows in DB without the .flush() line.

@Paul McMillan could you check if the proposed changes fix the issue ? ( openstack\_auth in comment #38 and horizon in comment #34, assuming both are required.)

Here is the updated impact description draft #2 (thanks to Thierry review):

Title: Horizon denial of service attack through login page

Description:

Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable reported a vulnerability in Horizon. By doing repeated requests to Horizon login page a remote attacker may generate unwanted session record, potentially resulting in a denial of service. All Horizon setups are affected.

(minor clarification)

I am not sure all Horizon setups are affected - I would say that Horizon setups using a db or memcached session engine would be impacted.

The default Horizon setting has been signed cookies in many cases, which does not suffer from this issue. (I am not sure which distros use signed cookies and which ones do not).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1192517#c0)  Lee Yarwood    2015-02-13 15:36:20 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Swift.py does not respect the OPENSTACK_SSL_NO_VERIFY setting for use with self signed certs. This issue has been resolved upstream [1] for the Juno release [2].  This isn't viable for a stable/Icehouse backport but IMHO is for a RHEL OSP 5.0.z backport.  [1] [https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/+bug/1311357](https://bugs.launchpad.net/horizon/%2Bbug/1311357) [2] <https://review.openstack.org/#/c/89975/>  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): python-django-horizon-2014.1.3-3.el7ost.src.rpm  How reproducible: Always.  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Configure a swift endpoint using self signed SSL certificates and attempt to use this from Horizon.  Actual results: Horizon is unable to use this endpoint as it's own Swift client ignores the OPENSTACK_SSL_NO_VERIFY option.  Expected results: Horizon is able to use this endpoint while the OPENSTACK_SSL_NO_VERIFY option is enabled.  Additional info:   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1192517#c7)  Ido Ovadia    2015-04-01 15:42:27 UTC  ``` Verified ======== python-django-horizon-2014.1.4-1.el7ost.noarch   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1192517#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-04-16 15:10:13 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=871855#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-04-03 14:20:32 UTC  ``` EMBARGOED via linux-distros:  CRD: 2014-04-08 15:00 UTC  From: Tristan Cacqueray Subject: [vs-plain] [pre-OSSA] Vulnerability in OpenStack Horizon (CVE-2014-0157)  This is an advance warning of a vulnerability discovered in OpenStack, to give you, as downstream stakeholders, a chance to coordinate the release of fixes and reduce the vulnerability window. Please treat the following information as confidential until the proposed public disclosure date.  Title: XSS in Horizon orchestration dashboard Reporter: Cristian Fiorentino (Intel) Products: Horizon Versions: 2013.2 version up to 2013.2.3  Description: Cristian Fiorentino from Intel reported a vulnerability in Horizon Orchestration dashboard. By tricking a Horizon user into using a malicious template in the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon, a remote attacker may trigger a cross-site-scripting vulnerability. It may result in potential assets theft (Horizon user/admin access credentials, tenants confidential information, etc.). Only setups exposing the orchestration dashboard in Horizon are affected.  Proposed patch: See attached patches. Unless a flaw is discovered in them, these patches will be merged to stable/havana and master (Icehouse development branch) on the public disclosure date.  CVE: CVE-2014-0157  Proposed public disclosure date/time: 2014-04-08 15:00 UTC Please do not make the issue public (or release public patches) before this coordinated embargo date.
