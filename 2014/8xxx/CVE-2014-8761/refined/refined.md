Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8761:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in insufficient access control checks within the `inc/template.php` file when handling media file details via AJAX calls. Specifically, the code only verifies access to the root namespace, neglecting proper checks for the actual namespace of the requested media file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the flawed authorization logic that fails to correctly validate user permissions for media files in different namespaces. The code uses a global variable `$NS` which isn't set correctly or is not properly checked.
*   **Incorrect Namespace Handling:** The code in `inc/template.php` uses `$NS` without properly validating it in `tpl_mediaFileDetails()`. This function checks if a namespace is set, and if it is, proceeds to check it with the media, but when it is not set, it defaults to the root namespace, allowing access to arbitrary media content that the user should not have access to.
*   **AJAX Calls:** The media details are loaded through AJAX calls, and these calls do not properly check the correct permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Media Metadata:** Attackers can access metadata (title, caption, EXIF data, history) of media files for which they don't have proper access. This metadata can reveal sensitive information.
*   **Potential Information Disclosure:** The exposure of metadata can lead to information disclosure, which could be used for further attacks or gaining knowledge about the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Media Manager Interaction:** An attacker can use the media manager interface to attempt to access a media file for which they lack permissions. The media manager, via AJAX requests,  will reveal the metadata.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **DokuWiki User:** An attacker must be a user of the DokuWiki instance, having the ability to access the media manager.
*   **Knowledge of Media File IDs:** The attacker must know the ID of the media file for which they want to access unauthorized metadata.
