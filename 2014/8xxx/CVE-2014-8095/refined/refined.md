Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8095:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from multiple functions within the XInput extension of the X.org X server failing to properly validate the length of requests received from X clients. Specifically, these functions do not check if the request length is sufficient to perform all the required operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read/write:** Due to the lack of length validation, the X server could attempt to read or write to memory locations outside the bounds of the allocated request buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation could lead to a crash of the X server due to segmentation faults from memory access violations.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** There's a potential, though not explicitly stated to be guaranteed, that the vulnerability could be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution. This is due to the ability to potentially overwrite memory within the server process.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The advisory from mageia.org indicates this vulnerability, along with others, "may lead to privilege escalation".

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending malicious requests via the X11 protocol to the X server. These requests exploit the lack of proper length checks in the affected XInput extension functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the X server, implying that the attacker must have network or local access to the system running the X server. Note that successful authentication to the X server is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected functions:**

The following XInput extension functions are vulnerable:
   - `SProcXChangeDeviceControl()`
   - `ProcXChangeDeviceControl()`
   - `ProcXChangeFeedbackControl()`
   - `ProcXSendExtensionEvent()`
   - `SProcXIAllowEvents()`
   - `SProcXIChangeCursor()`
   - `ProcXIChangeHierarchy()`
   - `SProcXIGetClientPointer()`
   - `SProcXIGrabDevice()`
   - `SProcXIUngrabDevice()`
   - `ProcXIUngrabDevice()`
   - `SProcXIPassiveGrabDevice()`
   - `ProcXIPassiveGrabDevice()`
   - `SProcXIPassiveUngrabDevice()`
   - `ProcXIPassiveUngrabDevice()`
   - `SProcXListDeviceProperties()`
   - `SProcXDeleteDeviceProperty()`
   - `SProcXIListProperties()`
   - `SProcXIDeleteProperty()`
   - `SProcXIGetProperty()`
   - `SProcXIQueryDevice()`
   - `SProcXIQueryPointer()`
   - `SProcXISelectEvents()`
   - `SProcXISetClientPointer()`
   - `SProcXISetFocus()`
   - `SProcXIGetFocus()`
   - `SProcXIWarpPointer()`

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved adding checks to ensure the request is large enough to include both the request header and a minimum amount of extra data.
- A new macro `REQUEST_AT_LEAST_EXTRA_SIZE` was created to help with this.
- This vulnerability has been present since the introduction of the XInput extension in X11R4 (1989).
- The X server needs to be running with root privileges for privilege escalation to be a serious concern. If not running with root privileges, an attacker could still achieve denial of service.
- The vulnerability is triggered only after client authentication.
