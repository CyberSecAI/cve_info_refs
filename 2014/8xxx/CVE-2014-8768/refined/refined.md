{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-8768",
    "description": "The application decoder for the geonet protocol fails to perform external input validation and performs insufficient checking on length computations leading to an unsafe decrement and underflow in the function geonet_print(netdissect_options *ndo, const u_char *eth, const u_char *bp, u_int length). The affected variable is length which is later on used to print a memory chunk which eventually leads to a segfault. The function contains several unsafe computations updating the length variable.",
    "affected_versions": "4.5.0 through 4.6.2",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation and unsafe length computations in the geonet_print function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer underflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash/segfault).",
    "attack_vector": "Sending a malformed Geonet packet to a system running tcpdump in verbose mode.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the machine running tcpdump."
