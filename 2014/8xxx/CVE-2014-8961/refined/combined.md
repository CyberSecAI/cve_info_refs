| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-07-23 09:53:16 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Description  Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in phpMyAdmin, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct script insertion attacks and bypass certain security restrictions.  1) An error when handling certain permissions can be exploited to view and manipulate otherwise restricted MySQL user tables.  Successful exploitation requires the configuration storage set up for the user groups feature.  This vulnerability is reported in versions prior to 4.1.14.2 and prior to 4.2.6.  2) Input passed via the column name to the table structure page when dropping a column is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in context of an  affected site when the malicious data is being viewed.  3) Input passed via the table name to the table operations page when dropping or truncating a table is not properly sanitised before being used. This can be exploited to insert arbitrary HTML and script code, which will be executed in a user's browser session in  context of an affected site when the malicious data is being viewed.  The vulnerabilities #2 and #3 are reported in versions prior to 4.0.10.1, prior to 4.1.14.2, and prior to 4.2.6.   Solution: Update to version 4.1.14.2 or 4.2.6.  Provided and/or discovered by: 1) The vendor credits Chirayu Chiripal. 2, 3) Reported by the vendor.  Original Advisory: PMASA-2014-6: <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2014-6.php>  PMASA-2014-7: <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2014-7.php>     @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2014-07-24 14:17:26 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-4986 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-4986>):   Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in js/functions.js in   phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.1, 4.1.x before 4.1.14.2, and 4.2.x before   4.2.6 allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or   HTML via a crafted (1) table name or (2) column name that is improperly   handled during construction of an AJAX confirmation message. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2014-08-10 20:53:54 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-4987 (<http://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2014-4987>):   server_user_groups.php in phpMyAdmin 4.1.x before 4.1.14.2 and 4.2.x before   4.2.6 allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access   restrictions and read the MySQL user list via a viewUsers request. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Jorge Manuel B. S. Vicetto (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2014-08-14 12:42:05 UTC  ``` 12:34 < irker982> gentoo-x86: jmbsvicetto dev-db/phpmyadmin: Bump to versions 4.0.10.1, 4.1.14.2 and 4.2.7. Fixes [bug 514894](show_bug.cgi?id=514894 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-db/phpmyadmin-{4.1.14.2,4.2.7}: XSS (CVE-2014-{4348,4349})"), 517858 and 519342.  4.1.14.2 and 4.2.7 are now in the tree.  At this point, let's move on with 4.1.14.2 stabilization. 4.2 can be done in a non-security bug. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-08-15 23:48:59 UTC  ``` Arches, please test and mark stable:  =dev-db/phpmyadmin-4.1.14.2  Target Keywords : "alpha amd64 hppa ppc ppc64 spark x86"  Thank you!  Since Version 4.2.7 is not stable, no need to stabilize as part of this security bug, it is being stabilized as part of [Bug 519342](show_bug.cgi?id=519342 "RESOLVED FIXED - dev-db/phpmyadmin-4.2.7 version bump"). ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-08-25 14:50:05 UTC  ``` A new vulnerability has been found, and the new versions come with this. No Stabilization needs to happen as part of this bug, moving it to [Bug 520142](show_bug.cgi?id=520142 "RESOLVED FIXED - <dev-db/phpmyadmin-{4.0.10.2,4.1.14.3,4.2.7.1}: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-{5273,5274})"), and setting it as blocker. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2014-12-29 05:56:48 UTC  ``` Versions no longer in tree.  Security please Vote.  GLSA Vote: No ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Yury German   Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev  2015-04-22 21:22:22 UTC  ``` New GLSA required for subsequent issues.  Adding this to the list. ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2015-05-31 19:21:19 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201505-03 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201505-03> by GLSA coordinator Kristian Fiskerstrand (K_F). ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906487#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2014-11-20 21:23:41 UTC  ``` <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2014-15.php>  Announcement-ID: PMASA-2014-15  Date: 2014-11-20 Summary: XSS vulnerability in error reporting functionality. Description:  With a crafted file name it is possible to trigger an XSS in the error reporting page.  Severity  We consider this vulnerability to be non critical. Mitigation factor  This vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who is logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required page. Affected Versions  Versions 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.7) and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.12) are affected. Solution  Upgrade to 4.1.14.7 or newer, or 4.2.12 or newer, or apply the patch listed below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906485#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2014-11-20 21:23:30 UTC  ``` <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2014-13.php>  Announcement-ID: PMASA-2014-13  Date: 2014-11-20 Summary: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities. Description      With a crafted database, table or column name it is possible to trigger an XSS attack in the table browse page.     With a crafted ENUM value it is possible to trigger XSS attacks in the table print view and zoom search pages.     With a crafted value for font size it is possible to trigger an XSS attack in the home page.  Severity  We consider this vulnerabilities to be non critical. Mitigation factor  These vulnerabilities can be triggered only by someone who is logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required pages. Moreover, exploitation of the XSS vulnerability related to the font size requires forgery of the pma_fontsize cookie. Affected Versions  Versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.6), 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.7) and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.12) are affected. Solution  Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.6 or newer, or 4.1.14.7 or newer, or 4.2.12 or newer, or apply the patch listed below. References  Thanks to Johannes Dahse (<https://twitter.com/FluxReiners>) for reporting XSS vulnerabilities in table browse and home pages.

## PMASA-2014-16

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2014-16

**Date:** 2014-11-20

### Summary

Leakage of line count of an arbitrary file.

### Description

In the error reporting feature, a parameter specifying the file was not correctly validated, allowing the attacker to derive the line count of an arbitrary file.

### Severity

We consider this vulnerability to be non critical.

### Mitigation factor

This vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who is logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required page.

### Affected Versions

Versions 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.7) and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.12) are affected.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.1.14.7 or newer, or 4.2.12 or newer, or apply the patch listed below.

### References

Thanks to Johannes Dahse (<https://twitter.com/FluxReiners>) for reporting this vulnerability.
