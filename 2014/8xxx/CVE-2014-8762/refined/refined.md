Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-8762:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `ajax_mediadiff` function in DokuWiki uses the `ns` parameter from user input to perform permission checks without properly validating if the namespace corresponds to the current media file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-807 (Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision):** The vulnerability stems from using an untrusted `ns` parameter directly in an access control decision within the `ajax_mediadiff` function. The application uses this parameter to determine the namespace for permission checks.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The application fails to verify if the provided namespace matches the actual namespace of the requested media, leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Media Metadata:** An attacker could access the metadata (title, caption, EXIF data, and full history) of media files they should not have permission to see.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The metadata can contain sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks or unintended exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed through crafted HTTP requests to the `ajax_mediadiff` function.
*   **Specifically crafted `ns` parameter**: By manipulating the `ns` parameter, an attacker can bypass the intended access restrictions and gain access to metadata of media in different namespaces.
*   The attacker needs to know the media file ID to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs remote access to the DokuWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of Media File ID:** The attacker would need to know the media file ID to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Understanding of DokuWiki:** Requires some knowledge of how DokuWiki handles media and how it's structured.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in DokuWiki versions prior to 2014-05-05a.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the namespace used for permission checks is derived from the requested media file ID instead of using the user-supplied parameter.
*   This issue was initially identified alongside other DokuWiki vulnerabilities, and all of them were fixed in later releases.
