There are two CVE IDs for 765 because there are apparently two
different types of problems.

This issue appears to be about incorrect authorization logic in the
inc/template.php file. Use CVE-2014-8761.

Here, within the ajax_mediadiff function, the ns parameter is
untrusted input, so this is an instance of CWE-807. Use CVE-2014-8762.

There was also a third report in 765:

> <https://github.com/splitbrain/dokuwiki/issues/765#issuecomment-47109046>
>
> I noticed this same issue with media manager & acl just today, but
> from the other way around. When a user has full access to a namespace
> but no access to the parent namespace. The media manager shows the
> images but gives a denied access message when viewing details.

We think this might not be a vulnerability, if the user in this
scenario was supposed to be able to view details, and "a denied access
message" suggests that the authorization check was incorrect only
because it was too strict. There is currently no CVE ID for this.

> <http://www.freelists.org/post/dokuwiki/Fwd-Dokuwiki-maybe-security-issue-Null-byte-poisoning-in-LDAP-authentication>

The first issue is about a valid username, and a non-empty password
that begins with a \0 character. It is analogous to CVE-2014-8088 in
the <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/10/5> post and
CVE-2014-6387 in the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/12/14> post. Use
CVE-2014-8763 for the occurrence of this mistake within DokuWiki.

> In addition, I have just found that Dokuwiki is also vulnerable to
> null-byte-forced anonymous binds (as opposed to just unauthenticated
> binds):
>
> With a Dokuwiki instance using Active Directory for LDAP
> authentication (as described earlier), one can log in using a username
> that has a null byte as the first character and with a password that
> similarly has a null byte as the first character. This will result in
> an anonymous bind being performed by Dokuwiki, and hence the log in
> will always succeed, regardless of the whether the username exists or
> not in the LDAP directory.

Use CVE-2014-8764 for this additional issue. (Within an application
that uses LDAP, input validation related to the possibility of an
empty or invalid username, and input validation related to the
possibility of an empty or invalid password, are relevant for
different reasons.)

## Description

```
inc/template.php in DokuWiki before 2014-05-05a only checks for access to the
root namespace, which allows remote attackers to access arbitrary images via a
media file details ajax call (CVE-2014-8761).

The ajax_mediadiff function in DokuWiki before 2014-05-05a allows remote
attackers to access arbitrary images via a crafted namespace in the ns
parameter (CVE-2014-8762).

DokuWiki before 2014-05-05b, when using Active Directory for LDAP
authentication, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a
password starting with a null (\0) character and a valid user name, which
triggers an unauthenticated bind (CVE-2014-8763).

DokuWiki 2014-05-05a and earlier, when using Active Directory for LDAP
authentication, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a user
name and password starting with a null (\0) character, which triggers an
anonymous bind (CVE-2014-8764).

## Description

[![@michitux](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198317?v=4&size=48)](/michitux)[michitux](https://github.com/michitux)opened [on Jun 25, 2014](https://github.com/dokuwiki/dokuwiki/issues/765#issue-36480567)

[A comment](https://bugs.dokuwiki.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=2647#comment6204) in our old bug tracker alerted me of this issue: in the media manager ACLs are broken for all views for individual files if you have access to the root namespace or - in the case of the media diff ajax call - an arbitrary namespace.

I have reproduced this issue in my local DokuWiki installation, I can simply open an image I have no permission for in the media manager, I get a permission denied message in the media details tab and when I click on the detail tabs they load via ajax with the real content. The media diff ajax call is a bit more difficult to test as the ns parameter (but only that one) is a post parameter, but after changing the code to accept a get parameter as well I can clearly see that it uses the ns parameter for the permission check (and nothing else).

No actual file content is exposed, just the metadata, but the metadata can contain a lot of information (title, caption etc. from the exif metadata) and the full history is displayed, too. This also requires knowing the actual media file id.

So far I can see the following problems in the code:

* in `ajax_mediadetails()`, `$NS` is not set, but in `tpl_mediaFileDetails()` `$NS` is used and its value is only checked when it is set (`if(isset($NS) && getNS($image) != $NS) return;`)
* `$AUTH` is a cache for the permissions of the current media ns (wtf?) which is set by `ajax_mediadiff()` using the "ns" parameter as namespace without any checks if this is actually the namespace of the current media file. This check is done in `tpl_mediaFileDetails()` but not in `media_diff()` which is called in `ajax_mediadiff()`.

I think a first fix could be to ignore the ns parameter in all ajax calls and instead set it based on the supplied image id.

I think we should fix this and release a hotfix release ASAP.

## Description

[![@michitux](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198317?v=4&size=48)](/michitux)[michitux](https://github.com/michitux)opened [on Jun 25, 2014](https://github.com/dokuwiki/dokuwiki/issues/765#issue-36480567)

[A comment](https://bugs.dokuwiki.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=2647#comment6204) in our old bug tracker alerted me of this issue: in the media manager ACLs are broken for all views for individual files if you have access to the root namespace or - in the case of the media diff ajax call - an arbitrary namespace.

I have reproduced this issue in my local DokuWiki installation, I can simply open an image I have no permission for in the media manager, I get a permission denied message in the media details tab and when I click on the detail tabs they load via ajax with the real content. The media diff ajax call is a bit more difficult to test as the ns parameter (but only that one) is a post parameter, but after changing the code to accept a get parameter as well I can clearly see that it uses the ns parameter for the permission check (and nothing else).

No actual file content is exposed, just the metadata, but the metadata can contain a lot of information (title, caption etc. from the exif metadata) and the full history is displayed, too. This also requires knowing the actual media file id.

So far I can see the following problems in the code:

* in `ajax_mediadetails()`, `$NS` is not set, but in `tpl_mediaFileDetails()` `$NS` is used and its value is only checked when it is set (`if(isset($NS) && getNS($image) != $NS) return;`)
* `$AUTH` is a cache for the permissions of the current media ns (wtf?) which is set by `ajax_mediadiff()` using the "ns" parameter as namespace without any checks if this is actually the namespace of the current media file. This check is done in `tpl_mediaFileDetails()` but not in `media_diff()` which is called in `ajax_mediadiff()`.

I think a first fix could be to ignore the ns parameter in all ajax calls and instead set it based on the supplied image id.

I think we should fix this and release a hotfix release ASAP.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
