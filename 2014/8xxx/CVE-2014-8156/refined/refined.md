- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `freesmartphone.org` (fso) stack contains insecure D-Bus system bus security policies in its configuration files. Specifically, the use of `<allow send_path="/some/path">` or `<allow send_path="/">` without proper restrictions allows local users to send D-Bus messages to arbitrary paths on any D-Bus system service, and not just the intended services. This is caused by a misunderstanding of the D-Bus policy files' syntax.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**: The D-Bus policy files grant overly permissive access to the D-Bus system bus, allowing local users to send messages to any service at specified paths.
    - **Misunderstanding of D-Bus policy syntax**: The developers of the fso stack incorrectly used multiple <allow send_*> rules in the same <policy> block, assuming a "logical and" operation, when it's actually "logical or".
    - Vulnerable configurations include:
        - `<allow send_path="/org/freesmartphone/Framework"/>` which allows sending D-Bus messages to any service at that path
        - `<allow send_path="/"/>` allows sending D-Bus messages to the root path of any service
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Local Denial of Service (DoS)**: Exploiting the vulnerability can cause the `dbus-daemon` to consume arbitrary amounts of memory, leading to a denial of service. This is specifically possible in older versions of `dbus-daemon` before versions 1.8.14 and 1.9.6
    - **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution**: The worst-case impact could be arbitrary root code execution, although no specific service with this vulnerability is identified, this impact would depend on how a vulnerable service handles messages received at the affected paths.
- **Attack vectors**: Local users can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user account is required to send D-Bus messages to affected system services.
