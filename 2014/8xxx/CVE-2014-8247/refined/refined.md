Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-8247:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue caused by insufficient input filtering in the server exception message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can execute specially crafted script in the context of the end-user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**
