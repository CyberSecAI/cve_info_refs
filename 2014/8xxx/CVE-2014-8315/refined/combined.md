Abstract:
-------------
BusinessObjects Explorer does not validate the user defined inputs of
parameter CMS name, which consists of a host name and port number.
This can be used to perform a port scan within the network range where
the BusinessObject Explorer server is located.
This vulnerability could be triggered as unauthenticated user.

Affected:
---------
Vulnerable:
SAP BusinessObjects Explorer version 14.0.5 (build 882)

Not tested:
Other versions of BusinessObjects Explorer

Technical Description:
----------------------
It is possible to disable that a user is able to choose the CMS feature.
Nonetheless, the client sends this value to the server where it gets
interpreted. This allows abusing this feature for port scanning
purposes as it is possible to determine a port's state from the
response time.

A request with a valid host and open port will get a time-out response
after 10 seconds while a request to an invalid host name or closed
port will return an error in less than 500 milliseconds.
