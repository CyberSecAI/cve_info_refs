Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8628:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs during the parsing of X.509 certificates in PolarSSL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak vulnerability in the X.509 certificate parsing functionality of PolarSSL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). By triggering the memory leak, an attacker can cause the affected system to run out of memory or become unstable, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by providing a specially crafted X.509 certificate to an application using the vulnerable version of PolarSSL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious X.509 certificate to a service utilizing the vulnerable PolarSSL library. This could potentially be achieved through various means, such as a TLS handshake or a service accepting certificate uploads.
