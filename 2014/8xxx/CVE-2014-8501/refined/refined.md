Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8501:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**
   - The provided data includes mentions of CVE-2014-8501 in the context of `binutils`, which aligns with the CVE description. The Oracle Linux bulletin, the Sourceware bugzilla entry, and the Ubuntu security notice all explicitly list CVE-2014-8501 as related to `binutils`.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the `_bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in` function within the libbfd library of GNU binutils. This function processes the AOUT header of PE executable files, and a crafted file with an invalid `NumberOfRvaAndSizes` value can trigger the out-of-bounds write.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Out-of-bounds write:** The primary weakness is the ability to write outside the intended buffer boundary during the parsing of the PE AOUT header. Specifically, when parsing a PE executable, the function `_bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in` does not correctly handle an invalid or very large `NumberOfRvaAndSizes` field, leading to memory corruption.
   - **Lack of Proper Validation:** The code fails to adequately validate the `NumberOfRvaAndSizes` field before using it in calculations and write operations.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit can cause a crash (segmentation fault) of the affected application due to the out-of-bounds write, leading to a denial of service.
   - **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):** The vulnerability is classified as potentially allowing arbitrary code execution. By carefully controlling the out-of-bounds write, it *might* be possible to overwrite parts of memory used by other running parts of the system, leading to code execution under the same privileges of the vulnerable application, but no proof of concept for arbitrary code execution was provided in the content provided.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted PE executable file that has a corrupted AOUT header, particularly an invalid `NumberOfRvaAndSizes` field.
   - **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user into processing this crafted file using a vulnerable tool from the `binutils` suite (e.g., `strings`, `objdump`, etc.) to trigger the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to create a malformed PE executable.
    - The attacker needs to convince a user to use an application which utilizes the `binutils` library to process the crafted file.
    - No special network access is needed and it can be locally exploited.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix is implemented by adding proper checks and handling for the `NumberOfRvaAndSizes` field.
*   The fix for this was released in sourceware git, and later made it to binutils 2.25.
*   This vulnerability is present in multiple applications that use the binutils library for file parsing and manipulation.
*   The "strings" utility (and others) have been modified in some distributions to avoid using the vulnerable code, and instead use other safe methods of extracting information.
