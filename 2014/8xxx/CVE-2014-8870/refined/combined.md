10/12/2024 - Milesight UG67 Advisories Released

We discovered several vulnerabilities in the Milesight UG67 Outdoor LoRaWAN Gateway. The device had an [unprotected USB console](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2024-001/) allowing access to the root file-system for analysis, an [undocumented default password](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2024-002/) usable for remote SSH login, a [command execution circumventing the restricted shell](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2024-003/) and a [local privilege escalation using ubus](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2024-004/) as well as a [local privilege escalation using world-writeable webroot](https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2024-005/). The issues can be combined to allow privileged access from a remote connection.

# FAQ

Why should we conduct a penetration test?

Computers and the associated IT infrastructure have become an indispensable part of every business today. However, this leads to a growing amount of critical data being stored in IT systems, as well as a dependence on these systems to function reliably. Consequently, attacks on corporate IT systems in the form of industrial espionage, disruption of system availability, ransomware attacks, and other methods to significantly harm a company are on the rise. A penetration test provides insights into the security status of your systems and the likelihood of a successful attack on your structures. It also offers recommendations on how to better protect yourself from potential compromises in the future. For a detailed explanation of why penetration testing is beneficial, refer to the [Definition](/en/pentest/) section.

What is the workflow of a penetration test?

Before every penetration test, a personal preliminary meeting takes place as a fundamental step. During this preliminary meeting, the possibilities of a penetration test concerning the customer’s systems are presented. A penetration test only makes sense if it is conducted in a customised and customer-oriented manner. Once the details are clarified, the penetration test is carried out within an agreed-upon period. Immediately following the test, a final presentation takes place, providing insight into the discovered vulnerabilities along with corresponding solution proposals. Additionally, a detailed report is handed over. More detailed information about the process of a penetration test can be found under [workflow](/en/pentest/workflow/).

How is RedTeam Pentesting different from other companies that offer penetration tests?

RedTeam Pentesting specialises exclusively in penetration testing, unlike many other companies in the IT security industry that offer penetration testing as one of many services in their portfolio. At RedTeam Pentesting, the purpose of the penetration test is not to sell additional services but to provide an independent security assessment.

Security specialists at RedTeam Pentesting work closely in teams to achieve practical results. The results are thoroughly documented with the aim of conveying the necessary knowledge about vulnerabilities in an understandable way. This allows our customers to fully understand and efficiently address any vulnerabilities found. Furthermore, all [employees of RedTeam Pentesting](/en/redteam) are permanent staff. Even during peak periods, no subcontractors or freelancers are used to ensure both the consistently high quality of the tests and confidentiality.

At the end of the penetration test, we provide the customer not only with a detailed report describing the vulnerabilities, risks, and proposed solutions but also present the results in a personal meeting. This allows the customer not only to view the systems from an attacker’s perspective during live demonstrations of the vulnerabilities but also to discuss the vulnerabilities with the security specialists.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
