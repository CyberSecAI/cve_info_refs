{
  "cve": "CVE-2014-8469",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application stores user agent strings in a database without sanitization, and later displays these strings in the administrative panel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of an administrator's browser session when they view the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker sends a crafted User-Agent string in an HTTP request to the target application which gets stored in the database.",
       "An administrative user then views the 'Online Guests/Boots' section within the AdminCP panel"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to send an HTTP request with a malicious User-Agent string, and have an administrative user with access to the vulnerable page."
  },
  "patch": "The patch involves sanitizing the User-Agent string by using `strip_tags` when displaying it in the admin panel to prevent the execution of injected JavaScript code."
