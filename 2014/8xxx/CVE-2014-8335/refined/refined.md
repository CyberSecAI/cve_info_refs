Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8335:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2014-8335` and describes it as the issue where "local users can see a password by listing process arguments". This matches the description in the provided mail from cve-assign@mitre.org, thus the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the `WP-DBManager` plugin passing the MySQL database password as a command-line argument to the `mysqldump` utility. When the `mysqldump` command is executed, the password is exposed in the process table, where it can be viewed by local users using tools like `ps`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cleartext Password Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the database password in cleartext within the process table.
    *   **Lack of Argument Sanitization:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or mask the password before passing it to the `mysqldump` command.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious local user can obtain the MySQL database password by monitoring the process table. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete compromise of the application's data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the system where the WordPress instance and `WP-DBManager` plugin are installed. An attacker with a shell on the server can use tools like `ps` to view the process list and extract the password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a local user with access to the server's command line or the ability to execute system commands.

**3. Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is not related to command injection, which is a separate vulnerability in this plugin addressed by CVE-2014-8334.
*   The vulnerability is present because the plugin directly passes the database password via the `--password` flag to the `mysqldump` command and does not overwrite it.
*   The provided content includes a proof of concept (`PoC`) for identifying the exposed credentials, using `ps` and `grep`.

**4. Code Snippets demonstrating the issue:**

The relevant code snippets showing the password being passed as a command-line argument can be seen in the `wp-dbmanager.php` file:
```php
$backup['command'] = $brace.$backup['mysqldumppath'].$brace.' --force --host="'.$backup['host'].'" --user="'.DB_USER.'" --password="'.$backup['password'].'"'.$backup['port'].$backup['sock'].' --add-drop-table --skip-lock-tables '.DB_NAME.' > '.$brace.$backup['filepath'].$brace;
```
and later the command being executed via:
```php
passthru($command, $error);
```

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-8335 exposes MySQL database credentials due to the `WP-DBManager` plugin's insecure method of passing the password to the `mysqldump` utility. The password becomes visible to local users via the process table, enabling unauthorized database access. This vulnerability is distinct from the command injection vulnerability identified by CVE-2014-8334.
