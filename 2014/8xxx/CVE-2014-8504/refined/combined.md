# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Binutils, the worst of which
may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.25** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or overwrite arbitrary
files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.25"

```

# USN-2496-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

9 February 2015

Applications from GNU binutils could be made to crash, run programs,
or delete arbitrary files as your login if they opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup\_group function in libbfd in

GNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8485](/security/CVE-2014-8485))

Hanno Böck discovered that the \_bfd\_XXi\_swap\_aouthdr\_in function

in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8501](/security/CVE-2014-8501))

Hanno Böck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the

pe\_print\_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker

could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8502](/security/CVE-2014-8502))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal

vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft

input that could delete arbitrary files. ([CVE-2014-8737](/security/CVE-2014-8737))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered the \_bfd\_slurp\_extended\_name\_table

function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling

extended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to

craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8738](/security/CVE-2014-8738))

Hanno Böck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex\_scan

function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this

to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash). ([CVE-2014-8503](/security/CVE-2014-8503))

Michal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the

srec\_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could

use this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash); the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf

protection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8504](/security/CVE-2014-8504))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the srec\_scan function in libbfd

in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could

use this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04

LTS. ([CVE-2014-8484](/security/CVE-2014-8484))

Sang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the

\_objalloc\_alloc function and objalloc\_alloc macro in binutils. This

could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application

crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-3509](/security/CVE-2012-3509))

Alexander Cherepanov and Hanno Böck discovered multiple additional

out-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use

these to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may

be limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort)

by the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf protection.

The strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when

examining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not

originally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As

a defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to

default to 'strings --all' behavior, which does not use libbfd; use

the new argument to strings, '--data', to recreate the old behavior.

Subject: Re: Re: strings / libbfd crasher

Well, there's also a trivial stack buffer overflow in srec.c near line 254:

      char buf[10];
...
        sprintf (buf, "\\%03o", (unsigned int) c);

But with this test case, c will be -44, or "\1777777777777777777724",
which sounds a lot longer than 9 characters.
