How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The documentation states that paths of elemets within an archive are stored relative to the archive itself.  But it does not forbid directory traversal in the paths.  Cheers   Nick ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=17533#c7)  Alexander Cherepanov    2014-11-04 16:51:33 UTC  ``` The danger is in overwriting sensitive files (e.g. authorized_keys) by an unconscious user or by an automatic process while extracting the contents of an archive. For similar examples please see <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2007-4131> (tar) and <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2010-4651> (patch).  Both absolute and relative paths could be used for the attack.  BTW creation of hidden files (with names starting with a dot) could also be viewed as undesirable. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=17533#c8)  Alexander Cherepanov    2014-11-04 22:15:52 UTC  ``` See also [bug #17552](show_bug.cgi?id=17552 "RESOLVED FIXED - strip/objcopy: directory traversal"). ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=17533#c9)  Nick Clifton    2014-11-05 16:23:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 7902](attachment.cgi?id=7902&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=7902&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=17533#c10)  Nick Clifton    2014-11-05 16:24:53 UTC  ``` Hi Alexander,    I have uploaded a possible patch to address the directory traversal issue.

AddressSanitizer said "stack-buffer-overflow" and then "WRITE of size
8". Ok.

Here, AddressSanitizer said "heap-buffer-overflow" and then "READ of
size 1".

Why this crasher is judged as CVE worthy? Is it oversight or are invalid
reads assumed to be exploitable by default?

Another possibility is to treat all crashes in all libraries as CVE
worthy. We don't know how these libraries are used ITW and any crash in
any of them could potentially lead to data loss in some application. But...

...it seems libbfd is not treated as a library any crash in which is CVE
worthy.

Again "READ of size 1".

BTW is there a method to quickly sort out crashes (or other bad
behavior) into potentially exploitable and presumably non-exploitable,
i.e. separate security issues from non-security ones? For instance, to
run it through valgrind and sort out errors as follows:

Presumably non-exploitable:
- Invalid read of size ...
- Use of uninitialised value of size ...
- Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)
- Syscall param write(buf) points to uninitialised byte(s)
- Stack overflow in thread ...

Potentially exploitable:
- Invalid write of size ...
   (straight buffer overrun?)
- Argument 'size' of function malloc has a fishy (possibly negative)
value: ...
   (integer overflow?)
- Jump to the invalid address stated on the next line
   (corrupted stack?)

Simple fuzzing of objdump with zzuf (not even afl) quickly gives out
tens and hundreds of different cases of mentioned errors (mostly from
the first group:-). Now what?

Bonus:

<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17533>

$ printf '!<arch>\n//%48d%8s`\n' -2 '' > test.a
$ objdump -x test.a
Segmentation fault

At least 2.22, 2.24 and head are affected. ar, size, strip etc. are also
affected.

valgrind on head shows:

==14181== Invalid write of size 8
==14181==    at 0x4C2E467: memset (vg_replace_strmem.c:1094)
==14181==    by 0x448AD2: bfd_zalloc (opncls.c:1011)

==14181==    by 0x4048F9: main (objdump.c:3692)

This is "Invalid write", hence potentially exploitable? Is further
analysis required before deciding if this is a security issue? Or, more
strictly, is further analysis required before deciding if this issue is
CVE worthy?

# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Binutils, the worst of which
may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.25** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or overwrite arbitrary
files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.25"

```

# USN-2496-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

9 February 2015

Applications from GNU binutils could be made to crash, run programs,
or delete arbitrary files as your login if they opened a specially
crafted file.

## Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup\_group function in libbfd in

GNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8485](/security/CVE-2014-8485))

Hanno Böck discovered that the \_bfd\_XXi\_swap\_aouthdr\_in function

in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8501](/security/CVE-2014-8501))

Hanno Böck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the

pe\_print\_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker

could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8502](/security/CVE-2014-8502))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal

vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft

input that could delete arbitrary files. ([CVE-2014-8737](/security/CVE-2014-8737))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered the \_bfd\_slurp\_extended\_name\_table

function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling

extended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to

craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8738](/security/CVE-2014-8738))

Hanno Böck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex\_scan

function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this

to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash). ([CVE-2014-8503](/security/CVE-2014-8503))

Michal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the

srec\_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could

use this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash); the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf

protection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8504](/security/CVE-2014-8504))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the srec\_scan function in libbfd

in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could

use this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04

LTS. ([CVE-2014-8484](/security/CVE-2014-8484))

Sang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the

\_objalloc\_alloc function and objalloc\_alloc macro in binutils. This

could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application

crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-3509](/security/CVE-2012-3509))

Alexander Cherepanov and Hanno Böck discovered multiple additional

out-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use

these to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may

be limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort)

by the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf protection.

The strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when

examining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not

originally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As

a defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to

default to 'strings --all' behavior, which does not use libbfd; use

the new argument to strings, '--data', to recreate the old behavior.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : binutils
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8484 CVE-2014-8485 CVE-2014-8501 CVE-2014-8502
                 CVE-2014-8503 CVE-2014-8504 CVE-2014-8737 CVE-2014-8738

Multiple security issues have been found in binutils, a toolbox for
binary file manipulation. These vulnerabilities include multiple memory
safety errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
restrictions, path traversal attack or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.22-8+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.25-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your binutils packages.
