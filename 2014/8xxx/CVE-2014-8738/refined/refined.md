Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8738:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of extended name tables within archive files by the `_bfd_slurp_extended_name_table` function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library. Specifically, when processing a malformed archive file with a corrupted extended name table, the code attempts to perform an invalid write operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Invalid memory write:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds write caused by incorrect handling of the extended name table data. This occurs within the `memset` function that's invoked after memory allocation via `bfd_zalloc`. This suggests the size of memory allocated wasn't correctly aligned with what was being written.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash, leading to a denial of service. Specifically, the tools `objdump`, `ar`, `size`, and `strip` are affected.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** The invalid write could potentially be exploited for more severe impacts, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, although this is not explicitly stated as being easily achievable.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malformed archive file:** An attacker can craft a malformed archive file that contains a corrupted extended name table. This crafted file is then processed by vulnerable binutils tools (`objdump`, `ar`, `size`, `strip`, etc.) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create malicious files:** An attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a specially crafted archive file.
- **User interaction:** A user must attempt to process the malicious archive file using a vulnerable tool. This can be a user running a command directly or an automated system that processes files.

**Technical details:**
- The specific vulnerability is an invalid write of size 8.
- The `memset` function is involved, indicating memory corruption in the form of writing to memory out of the allocated boundary.
- The vulnerable function is `_bfd_slurp_extended_name_table` in `archive.c`.
- The crash occurs during the parsing of archive files, and specific crafted archives cause the tools to crash due to invalid memory operations
- The vulnerability is present in affected versions of GNU binutils (at least 2.22, 2.24, and head/master).
- The vulnerability is fixed in this commit:  `bb0d867169d7e9743d229804106a8fbcab7f3b3f`.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content shows a related discussion about multiple vulnerabilities in binutils.
- There are also directory traversal issues mentioned in the discussion (related to CVE-2014-8737), where an attacker can write to arbitrary locations via crafted archive files.
- The fix for CVE-2014-8738 involved handling the corrupted extended name tables gracefully and preventing the invalid memory write.
