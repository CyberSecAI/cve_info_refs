  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-8594",
      "root_cause": "Insufficient restrictions on certain MMU update hypercalls",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of proper checks on MMU update operations targeting page tables.",
        "Access to certain function pointers that should remain NULL when using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP)"
      ],
      "impact": "Privilege escalation or denial of service. A malicious PV guest can manipulate memory mappings to potentially execute arbitrary code or cause system crashes by performing a null pointer dereference.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious or buggy stub domain kernels or tool stacks outside of Domain0",
         "PV service domains for HVM or PVH guests which have privilege over the guest",
        "Radically disaggregated systems where HVM/PVH service domain software is not always controlled by the host administrator."
      ],
        "required_capabilities": [
           "A PV domain with privilege over other guests.",
           "The targeted guests must be HVM using HAP or PVH",
           "Ability to perform hypercalls that update the MMU"
        ],
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is only exposed to PV service domains for HVM or PVH guests which have privilege over the guest. This typically includes device model emulators. Running only PV guests or HVM guests with shadow paging enabled avoids the issue."
