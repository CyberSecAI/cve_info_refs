- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An error existed in the Bluetooth driver that allowed a malicious application to control the size of a write to kernel memory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the Bluetooth driver that permits a malicious application to manipulate the size of a memory write operation to kernel memory, indicating a lack of proper input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious application could execute arbitrary code with system privileges, leading to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious application running locally on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires the ability to execute a malicious application on the target system.
