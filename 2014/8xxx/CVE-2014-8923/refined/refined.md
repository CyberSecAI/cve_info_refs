- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper logging configuration in IBM Security Identity Manager Active Directory Adapter for Windows, which can result in passwords being written in clear text to log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information exposure through logging of plaintext passwords
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Unauthorized access to user credentials if an attacker gains access to the log files.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker who has access to the log files where cleartext passwords are stored. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to the server or location where the log files are stored and be able to read the files.
