Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2014-8160:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The core issue lies within the `net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_proto_generic.c` file of the Linux kernel. Specifically, when conntrack rules are set via iptables for certain protocols (SCTP, DCCP, GRE, and UDP-Lite), but the corresponding conntrack module for that protocol is NOT loaded in the kernel, the connection tracking system would create a generic (and incorrect) connection tracking entry. This incorrect entry lacks specific port information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Conntrack:**  The vulnerability stems from how the kernel handles connection tracking (conntrack) for protocols when their specific helper module isn't loaded. Instead of preventing the connection, it attempts generic handling, leading to incorrect entries.
- **Bypass of Firewall Rules:** The generic conntrack entry does not include port information, so packets will later match existing connections when they should have been rejected according to rules using protocol-specific connection tracking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Firewall Bypass**: Attackers can bypass iptables rules designed to restrict access to specific ports of protocols (SCTP, DCCP, GRE and UDP-Lite) if a protocol-specific conntrack module isn't loaded.
- **Denial of Service**: While the original spinics patch description suggested that disabling all tracking for generic protocols might be needed, a solution was later implemented to only mitigate the problem when suitable protocol helpers were present, rather than disabling generic tracking entirely. This indicates that a complete mitigation of all related issues was complex.
- **Potential for further exploitation**: While the primary effect was bypassing of iptables rules, this sort of low level flaw could potentially be leveraged for more complex exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Packets:**  Exploitation is achieved through crafted network packets using protocols like SCTP, DCCP, GRE, or UDP-Lite when the corresponding protocol conntrack helper is not loaded.
- **Iptables configuration dependency:** The vulnerability is triggered when iptables rules are defined for specific protocols, but the respective kernel conntrack module isn't loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the vulnerable system.
- **Understanding of Iptables and Kernel Modules:** The attacker needs knowledge that the system uses certain firewall rules but is not loading the corresponding kernel modules that would enforce connection tracking, in addition to how to exploit this.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE description):**

- The provided content from SUSE details that the issue will no longer be resolved within kernel-default packages. It will instead be resolved through other channels
- Multiple advisories were issued from Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu regarding this CVE, showing that the issue affected multiple Linux distributions.
- A variety of kernel versions, across different distributions, were affected, indicating the scope of the issue.

**Summary:**
CVE-2014-8160 describes a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows an attacker to bypass firewall rules, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or further exploitation via a crafted network packet using protocols that lack corresponding conntrack modules.
