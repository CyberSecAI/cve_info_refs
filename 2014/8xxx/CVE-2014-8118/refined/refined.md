```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
    - Integer overflow in parsing CPIO headers, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2014-8118).
    - Race condition in package signature validation during the installation process, where RPM writes file contents to a temporary name and verifies signature only after writing is complete, allowing for execution of attacker-chosen code (CVE-2013-6435).

- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Integer overflow when processing CPIO headers, potentially leading to buffer overflows.
    - Race condition during package installation with a lack of proper validation before execution/interpretation of file contents.

- Impact of exploitation:
    - Arbitrary code execution during package installation by modifying signed RPM files.
    - Privilege escalation as the code would be executed during package installation.

- Attack vectors:
    - Maliciously crafted RPM files.
    - Exploiting the race condition between file writing and validation.

- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to create or modify RPM files.
    - Ability to entice a user to process a malicious RPM file.
