- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Gatekeeper checks could be bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A downloaded application signed with a revoked Developer ID certificate may pass Gatekeeper checks.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted applications signed with revoked Developer ID certificates.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to create and sign malicious applications, and have them downloaded by the target user.
