Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) when passed as native interfaces in Mozilla products. Specifically, when chrome objects protected by COW are passed as native interfaces, certain methods might expose normally protected objects to native methods that are accessible to web content. This bypasses intended security restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Bypassing Security Wrappers:** The primary weakness is the ability of web content to access DOM objects that are intended to be restricted to chrome-only access. This occurs because the COW protection is circumvented when passed as native interfaces.
- **Incorrect Interface Handling:** The core issue is that the browser doesn't properly manage object wrapping when chrome objects are passed as native interfaces, leading to a bypass of the expected security mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privileged Access:**  Successful exploitation could grant web content privileged access to DOM objects that should be exclusively accessible to chrome-level code.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Although considered low risk by the reporter, the vulnerability has the potential for arbitrary code execution depending on what methods/properties of chrome objects get exposed.
- **Unspecified impact:** The security advisory mentions 'other unspecified impact', indicating there might be other attack vectors related to this issue which were not fully known at the time.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Content Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered via malicious web content, meaning a webpage crafted by an attacker could exploit this flaw.
- **Native Interface Bypass:** The attack relies on the browser incorrectly allowing COW protected objects to be passed as native interfaces to certain methods, and these objects being accessed or manipulated by native methods in unexpected ways.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Craft Malicious Web Content:** Attackers need the ability to create or inject malicious code into web pages.
- **Knowledge of Specific Native Interfaces:** The attacker would need knowledge of the specific native methods and interface types that are vulnerable and how to exploit them by passing chrome objects that satisfy certain conditions or manipulate the wrapped objects in a harmful manner.
- **User Interaction:** While not explicitly mentioned, successful exploitation requires a user to visit or interact with the malicious web content.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Mozilla developer Bobby Holley.
- The fix involves preventing COWs from being passed as native interfaces, effectively stopping the bypass of security restrictions.
- The fix was included in Firefox 34 and SeaMonkey 2.31, indicating the vulnerability affected these versions.

This vulnerability has been classified as having a 'moderate' impact and 'low' risk of exploitation, yet it is still important due to the potential for privilege escalation and the ability to bypass security protections.
