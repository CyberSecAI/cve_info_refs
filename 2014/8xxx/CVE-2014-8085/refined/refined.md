Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `CWebContact::doModel()` method within the `contact.php` script of Osclass. Specifically, the method does not properly validate the file extension of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows users to upload files without proper validation of their types/extensions.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize the uploaded filename.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can upload a malicious PHP script disguised as a valid file (e.g., image.php) and execute it on the server. This allows the attacker to gain control of the system or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated file upload via the contact form.
- The attacker must have the "attachment" option enabled in the contact form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the contact form and upload files.
- The contact form's "attachment" option must be enabled.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `/oc-includes/osclass/controller/contact.php` file.
- The vulnerable code is between lines 97 and 113.
- The issue was fixed in version 3.4.3
