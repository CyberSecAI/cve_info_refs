Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in how OS X Gatekeeper handles Java JAR (.jar) files. While Gatekeeper is designed to prevent the execution of untrusted code, it can be bypassed by renaming a JAR file to remove its extension and then distributing it within a disk image (.DMG) file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of Gatekeeper:** The core vulnerability is the ability to circumvent Gatekeeper's security checks, which are intended to prevent the execution of unsigned or untrusted code.
*   **Incorrect File Type Handling:** Gatekeeper relies on file extensions to determine if a file is executable. Removing the ".jar" extension allows a JAR file to be treated as a generic data file, thus bypassing the security check.
*   **Lack of Content-Based Inspection:**  Gatekeeper does not perform deep content-based inspection to identify executable JAR files when they lack the standard extension.
*   **Reliance on File Extensions:** The reliance on file extensions makes the system vulnerable to simple renaming tricks.
*   **Exploitation with DMG Files:** Distributing the renamed JAR file within a DMG file allows an attacker to potentially add other files to gain the user's trust.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary, unsigned code on a target system, even if Gatekeeper is set to its most restrictive setting ("Mac App Store only").
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to install malware, spyware, or other malicious software onto a user's system.
*   **System Compromise:** Depending on the code executed, an attacker could gain full control of the system, access sensitive data, or use the system for further malicious activities.
*   **Complete Gatekeeper Bypass:** The exploit bypasses all Gatekeeper protections, regardless of the security settings configured.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can distribute malicious DMG files through phishing emails, malicious websites, or other deceptive means, tricking users into downloading and opening them.
*   **Web Downloads:**  Users can be tricked into downloading malicious DMG files hosted on attacker-controlled servers.
*   **Disk Images (DMG):** The use of DMG files allows attackers to combine the malicious JAR file with other files to make it more believable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create JAR Files:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious Java JAR file.
*   **Ability to Create DMG Files:** The attacker must be able to create a DMG file to package the malicious payload.
*   **Ability to Distribute DMG File:** The attacker needs to distribute the malicious DMG file to the target user through various channels.
*   **Java Runtime Requirement:** Java needs to be installed on the victim's machine for the exploit to work.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must download the DMG file and double-click the renamed JAR file for the malicious code to execute.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Amplia Security Research.
*   The vulnerability affects OS X Lion v10.7.5 and later, including OS X Mountain Lion, OS X Mavericks, and OS X Yosemite.
*   Apple has released a security update to address this vulnerability, except for OS X Lion v10.7.5, which remains vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability is considered trivial to exploit.
*   The advisory includes a proof-of-concept demonstrating the bypass.
*   The use of a DMG file, coupled with removing the file extension, makes the attack more likely to succeed.

In summary, CVE-2014-8826 is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass the OS X Gatekeeper security mechanism through a simple file renaming trick. It requires user interaction but can lead to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.
