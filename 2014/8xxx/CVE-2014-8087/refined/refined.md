Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a lack of access protection on the `ph_save.php` script, located within the "post-highlights" WordPress plugin. This script directly includes `wp-load.php`, which initializes WordPress functionality, making it susceptible to manipulation by an attacker, allowing unauthorized access and modification of the plugin's settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Access Control:** The `ph_save.php` script lacks proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to interact with it.
*   **Unfiltered Output:** The plugin does not filter or encode user-supplied input when outputting the headline. Specifically, arbitrary HTML content entered into the headline field is directly output to the page without proper sanitization.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The combination of the above allows for a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability by injecting malicious HTML, including JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the content of affected pages, potentially leading to website defacement.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal user session cookies or other sensitive information through the injected JavaScript.
*   **Malware Distribution:** An attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by any user, without needing any prior authentication.
*   **Direct Script Manipulation:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable `ph_save.php` script via HTTP requests to inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need any login credentials or prior authorization on the WordPress website.

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory released by g0blin.co.uk provides more detail than the CVE description, including a CVSS score, a proof-of-concept script, and a timeline of the vulnerability.
*   The plugin was closed due to this security issue.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.6.1.
*   The `ph_save.php` script enables the "post highlights" and sets the "headline" field with an arbitrary piece of HTML.
