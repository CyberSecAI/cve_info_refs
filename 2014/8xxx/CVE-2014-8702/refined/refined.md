Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8702:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2014-8702 is a vulnerability in Wonder CMS 2014 where the application reveals its full server path. This occurs when a specific type of input is provided during the login process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The application fails to properly handle an array type parameter when hashing the password with `md5()`. Specifically, providing an array instead of the expected string to the `md5()` function during the login process results in a PHP warning that reveals the full path of the `index.php` file within the server's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can learn the full path of the application's installation directory on the server. This knowledge can be useful for further attacks, as it may provide insights into the system configuration and file structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request:** The attacker sends an invalid password, specifically an array instead of a string. This occurs during the user authentication process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to submit a login request to the Wonder CMS application. They do not need to be authenticated to exploit this issue.
