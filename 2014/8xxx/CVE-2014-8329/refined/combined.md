SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20140710-2 >
=======================================================================
              title: Multiple critical vulnerabilites
            product: Schrack MICROCONTROL emergency light system
 vulnerable version: before 1.7.0 (937)
      fixed version: 1.7.0 (937)
             impact: critical
           homepage: <http://www.schrack.at/shop/sicherheitsbeleuchtung.html>

=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
"The microControl is a decentralized power supply system with limited power
(LowPower system) for 1-, 3- or 8-hour operation. This system combines the high
reliability of a decentralized single-battery system with the ease and comfort
of a central battery system. "

Source: <http://image.schrack.com/datenblaetter/h_nlmi102_de.pdf>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
The Microcontrol emergency light system, distributed by Schrack Technik GmbH,
is an autarchic emergency light system, which is configurable over a web
interface.
Through the vulnerabilities described in this advisory an attacker can
reconfigure the whole emergency light system without authentication.

Furthermore he can perform attacks against the users of the web application
to deploy Cross-Site-Scripting Trojan Horses or steal sensitive data.

It is highly recommended by SEC Consult not to use this product until a
thorough security review has been performed by security professionals and all
identified issues have been resolved.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Access data disclosure
The access data for the ftp and telnet services is accessible without
authentication. This information enables an attacker to access the file system
of the emergency light system, where he can reconfigure the whole system.

2) Weak default password
The password for the web interface can't be changed. The emergency light system
is always delivered with the same weak password to every customer. An attacker
can reverse engineer the firmware of the emergency light system or request the
password from Schrack Technik GmbH.

3) Permanent Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
The emergency light system doesn’t encode user input properly. This leads to
Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities. The vulnerability can be used to
persistently include HTML- or JavaScript code to the affected web page. The code
is executed in the browser of users if they visit the manipulated site. The
vulnerability can be used to change the contents of the displayed site, redirect
to other sites or steal user credentials. Additionally, users are potential
victims of browser exploits and JavaScript Trojan Horses.

4) Clear text authentication
Login data of users is transmitted in clear text. By intercepting network
traffic, an attacker can eavesdrop authentication data and take over the
victim's account.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Access data disclosure
The ZTPUsrDtls.txt can be accessed via http://<system_ip>/ZTPUsrDtls.txt

2) Weak default password
The credentials are user:not

3) Permanent Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
Several Permanent Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities were noticed in the
product during the audit (e.g position textbox in the configuration menu).

4) Clear text authentication
The web page is only accessible via the HTTP protocol. Login data can be
recorded with a network sniffer.
Furthermore a telnet service is running (plain text protocol).

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The system tested was the MICROCONTROL 4 emergency light system.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2014-05-13: Contacted vendor through info () schrack com, requesting encryption
            keys and attaching responsible disclosure policy
2014-05-13: Reply from vendor, no encryption keys
2014-05-13: Phone call to clarify the transmission of the advisory (encryption)
2014-05-13: Sending the advisory encrypted to Schrack Technik GmbH
2014-06-03: Asking for status update
2014-06-03: Receiving information regarding patch / firmware update
2014-06-11: Asking for more details about the regarding patch / firmware update
2014-07-09: Phone call to clarify details about the regarding patch / firmware
            update
2014-07-10: SEC Consult releases security advisory

Solution:
---------
In order to solve issue 1) and 2) install firmware 1.7.0 (937), available by
sending a mail to info () schrack com

3) Schrack Technik GmbH is working on a patch for this vulnerability

4) For the embedded system, used by the product, SSL is not available.
Schrack Technik GmbH recommends using an own network segment for the emergency
light system.

Devices deliverd after 2014-07-01 already contain firmware 1.7.0 (937)

Workaround:
-----------
No workaround available.

# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.
