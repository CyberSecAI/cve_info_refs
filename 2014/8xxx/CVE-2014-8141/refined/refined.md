{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `getZip64Data()` function in `process.c` lacks proper error detection and reporting, leading to attempts to extract multi-byte data from a buffer that does not contain enough bytes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted zip file can cause a crash when processed by `unzip`, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious zip file is passed to the `unzip` command, specifically when used with the `-t` option for testing or during normal extraction.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious zip file and have it processed by a vulnerable version of `unzip`."

    }
  ],
  "additional_notes": [
    "The vulnerability is triggered due to an out-of-bounds read in the `getZip64Data()` function.",
    "The issue is limited to UnZip version 6.0, which introduced Zip64 support.",
    "The over-read is limited to 28 bytes, making a crash unlikely in normal builds, however it's still a vulnerability.",
     "The vulnerability can be triggered in both test mode (`unzip -t`) and extraction mode.",
     "This issue is related to other unzip vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-8139 and CVE-2014-8140) which were addressed in the same security update (RHSA-2015:0700).",
    "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not affected as it uses an older version of unzip (5.52) without Zip64 support."
