The provided content details vulnerabilities in the Xornic Contact Us Form, a PHP script. It describes two specific issues: a weak captcha implementation and a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**1. Weak Image Verification (Captcha Bypass):**

*   **Root Cause:** The script uses a weak "encryption" method for the captcha verification. Instead of proper encryption, it trims whitespace from the captcha result, base64-encodes it, prepends "Z4rtas" followed by the current day of the month, and uses this value to compare against the user-submitted captcha.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The captcha "encryption" is easily reversible using base64 decoding and removing the prepended string and current date.
    *   The script does not protect against replay attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Attackers can easily bypass the captcha and send spam emails through the contact form.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the contact form where a user would typically enter a captcha.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to view the HTML source of the page to observe the “encrypted” captcha value and submit the contact form with a manipulated “image” parameter.

**2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

*   **Root Cause:** The script directly includes user-provided data (`$_POST["name"]` and `$_POST["email"]`) within the HTML body of the email message without sanitization or escaping.
*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The script is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input.
    *   The setup.php script also has similar issues
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email body, which can be executed when the email is viewed by a recipient. This could lead to a variety of attacks, including session hijacking or redirecting the user to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The XSS vulnerability is exposed in the contact.php file. The $_POST variables used to construct the email's HTML body and $_SERVER["PHP_SELF"] within the setup.php form are attack vectors.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs the ability to submit input via the contact form to inject malicious code within the name or email fields.

**Summary of weaknesses:**

*   Inadequate captcha implementation using base64 encoding and easily predictable prefixes.
*   Improper sanitization/escaping of user input, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   General lack of security best practices in the design of the script.
