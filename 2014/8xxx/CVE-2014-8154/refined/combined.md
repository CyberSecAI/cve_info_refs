Further details are available in the following Red Hat bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177840>  References:  <https://git.gnome.org/browse/vala/commit/?id=3092537db65887e24a3d3e87a27caf9c5295e4f7> (fix) <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1181404> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-8154> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8154> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=913071#c1)  Frederic Crozat   2015-01-14 11:52:25 UTC  ``` Please note (from the RH bug report):  "All binaried built with the buggy bindings package that use Gst.MapInfo() function are affected. Binaries such as shotwell-video-thumbnailer run this function on untrusted input, which probably makes this bug fairly easy to exploit."  This implies shotwell, but I don't know how many others are affected :( ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=913071#c2)  Dominique Leuenberger   2015-01-14 11:53:42 UTC  ``` Affected openSUSE releases: 13.2 & Tumbleweed  for 13.2: preparing update for TW  : Updated vala version should hit fairly soon  The 'main issue' will be to identify the packages requiring a rebuild. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=913071#c3)  Frederic Crozat   2015-01-14 15:24:36 UTC  ``` It looks like shotwell in SLED12 is not affected ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=913071#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-01-14 23:02:23 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=913071#c5)  Dominique Leuenberger   2015-01-22 16:42:23 UTC  ``` Update submitted - assigning to maintenance for followup ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=913071#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2015-01-22 16:54:15 UTC  ``` while vala is shipped on the SLE12 BSK, we probably do not need to update it there.  opensuse update will be released soonish ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=913071#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-01-23 19:06:36 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0131-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1177840#c0)  Sergey "Shnatsel" Davidoff    2014-12-30 19:32:57 UTC  ``` Due to incorrect buffer length declaration in Vala bindings for the Gst.MapInfo() function in Vala versions 0.26.0 and 0.26.1, binaries that use that function are vulnerable to heap buffer overflow, which may result in a crash or arbitrary code execution depending on the binary.  All binaried built with the buggy bindings package that use Gst.MapInfo() function are affected. Binaries such as shotwell-video-thumbnailer run this function on untrusted input, which probably makes this bug fairly easy to exploit.  How reproducible:  This bug is always observable on e.g. shotwell-video-thumbnailer when building the binary with the buggy bindings with Address Sanitizer.  Steps to Reproduce:  1. Build Shotwell vith a vulnerable Vala version and -fsanitize=address C compiler flag 2. Run "shotwell-video-thumbnailer /home/user/any-video.webm" 3. Observe the crash  Alternatively, you can observe shotwell-video-thumbnailer output garbage instead of valid thumbnails when built with the buggy bindings without Address Sanitizer.  Additional info:  A patch for the issue is available: <https://git.gnome.org/browse/vala/commit/?id=3092537db65887e24a3d3e87a27caf9c5295e4f7>  The issue was fixed in vala git master but not identified as a security vulnerability until I've independently discovered it.  To mitigate it, the patch above should be applied to the bindings and then all binaries using Gst.MapInfo() have to be rebuild with the fixed bindings.  I'm going to submit the information about this bug to distros for CVE allocation, which means it will be disclosed on the 12th of January. If you need more time to identify, rebuild and re-upload affected packages, please let me know ASAP!   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1177840#c1)  Fedora End Of Life    2015-11-04 14:11:30 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 21 is nearing its end of life. Approximately 4 (four) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 21. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '21'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 21 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1177840#c2)  Fedora End Of Life    2015-12-02 06:39:57 UTC  ``` Fedora 21 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2015-12-01. Fedora 21 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ``` |  |
