{
  "CVE-2014-8173": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the Linux kernel's madvise MADV_WILLNEED functionality due to improper page table locking when handling transparent huge pages (THP) on NUMA systems.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "NULL Pointer Dereference",
        "Improper Locking"
      ],
      "impact": "A local, unprivileged user can trigger a system crash (denial of service) by exploiting this flaw.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local Access",
         "madvise() system call",
        "Crafted application"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local unprivileged user on a vulnerable system.",
       "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by the Linux kernelâ€™s madvise MADV_WILLNEED functionality not properly handling page table locking when dealing with transparent huge pages. The `pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad()` function did not function correctly because the `pmd_bad()` check is not triggered with a combination of `pmd_trans_huge()` and `pmd_numa()` being set. The issue can only be reproduced on systems with NUMA architecture."
