  **Product:** MODX Revolution

  **Severity:** Critical

  **Versions:** 2.0.0–2.2.14

  **Vulnerability type:** CSRF & XSS

  **Report date:** 2014-Jul-10

  **Fixed date:** 2014-Jul-15

  **Description**

  A significant vulnerability was discovered in the Manager login of MODX Revolution that also affects the use of the Login Extra. A malicious user could formulate a link that automatically logs the user into their own account, then redirects the user to a site the attacker controls immediately, exposing the user's CSRF token. This can be exploited with or without getting the user to enter their credentials in the form.

  **Affected Releases**

  All MODX Revolution releases prior to and including 2.2.14.

  **Solution**

  Upgrade to [MODX Revolution 2.2.15](http://modx.com/download/release/revolution-2.2.15-pl). Due to the nature of this issue and the number of files requiring changes the solution is to upgrade. No installable patch or fileset is available for prior versions.

  **Acknowledgement**

  We would like to thank Narendra Bhati, of [Suma Soft](http://www.sumasoft.com) for bringing this issue to our attention.
