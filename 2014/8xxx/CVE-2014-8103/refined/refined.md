Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from unvalidated lengths in the DRI3 and Present extensions of the X server. Specifically, the X server fails to properly validate the lengths or sizes of data sent by a client in various function calls related to these extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unvalidated Lengths:** The core weakness lies in the lack of proper checks on the lengths or sizes of data received from clients. This allows a malicious client to send requests with lengths that are greater than what is allocated, or use invalid offsets.
- **Out-of-bounds Access:**  Due to the unvalidated lengths, the server could perform out-of-bounds reads or writes, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** By causing the X server to access invalid memory locations, an attacker can crash the server leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some scenarios, exploiting these vulnerabilities could be a step towards achieving arbitrary code execution within the context of the X server process, although the provided content does not give specific examples of code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Clients:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by a malicious client connecting to the X server.
- **Malicious X Client:** An attacker can control a client application which connects to an X server and sends crafted requests to trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to X server:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the X server either from a remote connection, or through local access with a malicious application.
- **Knowledge of X protocol:** An understanding of the X protocol and the affected extensions (DRI3 and Present) is required to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability, along with multiple other vulnerabilities, was discovered by Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive.
- The vulnerability is present in the affected functions since their introduction in `xorg-server-1.15.0` (2013).
- Patches have been created and are available in git commit format.
- The fixes involve adding proper checks to validate the lengths and sizes of data sent by clients before processing them.
- Mitigation strategies include disabling network connections to the X server using the `-nolisten tcp` option and disabling GLX indirect contexts via the `-iglx` option. These options are recommended to be set by default in newer releases.
