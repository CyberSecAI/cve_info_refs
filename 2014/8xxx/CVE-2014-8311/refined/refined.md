*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected SAP Business Objects system.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of CORBA Interface:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the Business Objects CORBA interface to formulate the specific queries.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects SAP Business Objects Edge 4.0.
*   SAP released a patch (SAP Note 1998990) to address the vulnerability.
*   The initial base CVSS v2 score is 3.5 (AV:N/AC:M/AU:S/C:P/I:N/A:N) which indicates a low severity vulnerability.
