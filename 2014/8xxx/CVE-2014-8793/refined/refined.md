Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8793:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `refresh_page` GET parameter within the `www/admin/report-generate.php` script in Revive Adserver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application fails to sanitize the `refresh_page` parameter before including it in the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the vulnerable page.
*   **Context of the Vulnerable Website:** The injected code executes within the user's browser in the context of the vulnerable website. This could lead to actions such as session hijacking, stealing cookies, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Link:** An attacker can create a specially crafted link containing the malicious payload in the `refresh_page` parameter and trick a logged-in user into clicking it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote from the target system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, specifically the target user needs to click a malicious link.
*  **Logged-in user:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab.
*   The issue is present in Revive Adserver versions 3.0.5 and earlier.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the `refresh_page` parameter using `htmlspecialchars()` as seen in the provided github commit diff.
