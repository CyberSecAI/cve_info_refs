Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2014-8397:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- DLL hijacking due to uncontrolled search path element when loading a file associated with Corel VideoStudio PRO X7 or Corel FastFlick.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The applications search for a DLL file named "u32ZLib.dll" in the same directory as the opened file without validating the DLL's path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution within the context of the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can place a malicious DLL named "u32ZLib.dll" in the same directory as a legitimate Corel file (associated with Corel VideoStudio PRO X7 or Corel FastFlick) and then trick a user into opening that file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL in a location where a user will open a Corel file associated with the vulnerable application. The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network or host to perform this attack, but must be able to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted file.
- The vulnerable Corel application should not be running at the time the malicious file is opened.
