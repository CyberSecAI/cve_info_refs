## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-utopic](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-utopic) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Utopic

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of

the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the

SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest

OS. ([CVE-2015-0239](/security/CVE-2015-0239))

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread

Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to

obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout

Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-8133](/security/CVE-2014-8133))

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are

specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the

Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be

bypassed when conntrack rules are used. ([CVE-2014-8160](/security/CVE-2014-8160))

A flaw was discovered with file renaming in the linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system

hang). ([CVE-2014-8559](/security/CVE-2014-8559))

A flaw was discovered in how supplemental group memberships are handled in

certain namespace scenarios. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass

file permission restrictions. ([CVE-2014-8989](/security/CVE-2014-8989))

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the

task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86\_64 based machines. A

local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout

Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. ([CVE-2014-9419](/security/CVE-2014-9419))

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock\_continue function of the Linux

kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). ([CVE-2014-9420](/security/CVE-2014-9420))

A flaw was discovered in the fragment handling of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced

Meshing Protocol in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented

packets. ([CVE-2014-9428](/security/CVE-2014-9428))

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local

user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or

possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. ([CVE-2014-9529](/security/CVE-2014-9529))

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing

rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.

([CVE-2014-9584](/security/CVE-2014-9584))

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of

the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw

makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

([CVE-2014-9585](/security/CVE-2014-9585))

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs' encrypted file

name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2014-9683](/security/CVE-2014-9683))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) failed to

verify symlink size info. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous

UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9728](/security/CVE-2014-9728))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

valid inode size information . A local attacker, who is able to mount a

malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors.

([CVE-2014-9729](/security/CVE-2014-9729))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

correctly verify the component length for symlinks. A local attacker, who

is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other

undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9730](/security/CVE-2014-9730))

Carl H Lunde discovered an information leak in the UDF file system

(CONFIG\_UDF\_FS). A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file

system image, could exploit this flaw to read potential sensitve kernel

memory. ([CVE-2014-9731](/security/CVE-2014-9731))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of

the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the

SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest

OS. ([CVE-2015-0239](/security/CVE-2015-0239))

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread

Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to

obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout

Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-8133](/security/CVE-2014-8133))

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are

specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the

Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be

bypassed when conntrack rules are used. ([CVE-2014-8160](/security/CVE-2014-8160))

A flaw was discovered with file renaming in the linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system

hang). ([CVE-2014-8559](/security/CVE-2014-8559))

A flaw was discovered in how supplemental group memberships are handled in

certain namespace scenarios. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass

file permission restrictions. ([CVE-2014-8989](/security/CVE-2014-8989))

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the

task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86\_64 based machines. A

local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout

Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. ([CVE-2014-9419](/security/CVE-2014-9419))

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock\_continue function of the Linux

kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). ([CVE-2014-9420](/security/CVE-2014-9420))

A flaw was discovered in the fragment handling of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced

Meshing Protocol in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented

packets. ([CVE-2014-9428](/security/CVE-2014-9428))

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local

user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or

possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. ([CVE-2014-9529](/security/CVE-2014-9529))

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing

rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.

([CVE-2014-9584](/security/CVE-2014-9584))

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of

the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw

makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

([CVE-2014-9585](/security/CVE-2014-9585))

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs' encrypted file

name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2014-9683](/security/CVE-2014-9683))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) failed to

verify symlink size info. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous

UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9728](/security/CVE-2014-9728))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

valid inode size information . A local attacker, who is able to mount a

malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial

of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors.

([CVE-2014-9729](/security/CVE-2014-9729))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG\_UDF\_FS) did not

correctly verify the component length for symlinks. A local attacker, who

is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other

undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9730](/security/CVE-2014-9730))

Carl H Lunde discovered an information leak in the UDF file system

(CONFIG\_UDF\_FS). A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file

system image, could exploit this flaw to read potential sensitve kernel

memory. ([CVE-2014-9731](/security/CVE-2014-9731))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.10

* [linux-image-3.16.0-31-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.16.0-31.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-31.41)
* [linux-image-3.16.0-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.16.0-31.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-31.41)
* [linux-image-3.16.0-31-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.16.0-31.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-31.41)
* [linux-image-3.16.0-31-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.16.0-31.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-31.41)
* [linux-image-3.16.0-31-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.16.0-31.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-31.41)
* [linux-image-3.16.0-31-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.16.0-31.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-31.41)
* [linux-image-3.16.0-31-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.16.0-31.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.16.0-31.41)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-2515-1: Linux kernel (Trusty HWE) vulnerabilities

26 February 2015

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-trusty](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-trusty) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Trusty

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine's (KVM) emulation of

the SYSTENTER instruction when the guest OS does not initialize the

SYSENTER MSRs. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of

service of the guest OS (crash) or potentially gain privileges on the guest

OS. ([CVE-2015-0239](/security/CVE-2015-0239))

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread

Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to

obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout

Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this

flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.

([CVE-2014-8133](/security/CVE-2014-8133))

A restriction bypass was discovered in iptables when conntrack rules are

specified and the conntrack protocol handler module is not loaded into the

Linux kernel. This flaw can cause the firewall rules on the system to be

bypassed when conntrack rules are used. ([CVE-2014-8160](/security/CVE-2014-8160))

A flaw was discovered with file renaming in the linux kernel. A local user

could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system

hang). ([CVE-2014-8559](/security/CVE-2014-8559))

A flaw was discovered in how supplemental group memberships are handled in

certain namespace scenarios. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass

file permission restrictions. ([CVE-2014-8989](/security/CVE-2014-8989))

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the

task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86\_64 based machines. A

local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout

Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. ([CVE-2014-9419](/security/CVE-2014-9419))

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock\_continue function of the Linux

kernel's ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw

to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). ([CVE-2014-9420](/security/CVE-2014-9420))

A flaw was discovered in the fragment handling of the B.A.T.M.A.N. Advanced

Meshing Protocol in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this

flaw to cause a denial of service (mesh-node system crash) via fragmented

packets. ([CVE-2014-9428](/security/CVE-2014-9428))

A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel's key ring. A local

user could cause a denial of service (memory corruption or panic) or

possibly have unspecified impact via the keyctl commands. ([CVE-2014-9529](/security/CVE-2014-9529))

A memory leak was discovered in the ISO 9660 CDROM file system when parsing

rock ridge ER records. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain

sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted iso9660 image.

([CVE-2014-9584](/security/CVE-2014-9584))

A flaw was discovered in the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) of

the Virtual Dynamically linked Shared Objects (vDSO) location. This flaw

makes it easier for a local user to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.

([CVE-2014-9585](/security/CVE-2014-9585))

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs' encrypted file

name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative

privileges. ([CVE-2014-9683](/security/CVE-2014-9683))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.13.0-46-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-46.75~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-46.75~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.13.0-46-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty)
  -
  [3.13.0-46.75~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-46.75~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.
