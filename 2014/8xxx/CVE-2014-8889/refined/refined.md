{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the INTERNAL_WEB_HOST Intent extra parameter within the Dropbox SDK's authentication Activity. This parameter, when controlled by an attacker, allows redirection of the authentication process to an attacker-controlled server, leading to the leakage of the nonce.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of Intent extra parameters.",
      "Insecure handling of authentication flow by allowing redirection to arbitrary hosts.",
      "Lack of sufficient protection against the leakage of the nonce, meant to be secret."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can link applications to their Dropbox accounts without the victim's knowledge, potentially leading to data theft, uploading of malicious files, and compromising other data saved on cloud storage.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious applications installed on the user's device that can trigger the vulnerable code.",
        "Remote attacks through drive-by techniques, where victims are lured to malicious websites that exploit the vulnerability.",
        "HTTP redirects that cause the vulnerable Dropbox SDK Activity to be invoked with malicious payloads."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create a malicious application or a malicious web page.",
      "Ability to obtain a valid access token from the attacked application by using their own Dropbox account.",
      "Control of a server with an SSL certificate to intercept and redirect traffic."
    ]
