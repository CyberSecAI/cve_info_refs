The provided content is related to CVE-2014-8398.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a DLL hijacking issue in Corel FastFlick. When a file associated with Corel FastFlick is opened, the application attempts to load several DLL files. The application does not properly validate the path of these DLLs, resulting in it searching for them in the same directory as the opened file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427)
- DLL Hijacking

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the Corel FastFlick application. This can lead to a full compromise of the user's system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must place a malicious DLL file with the same name as one of the vulnerable DLLs (igfxcmrt32.dll, ipl.dll, MSPStyleLib.dll, uFioUtil.dll, uhDSPlay.dll, uipl.dll, uvipl.dll, VC1DecDll.dll, or VC1DecDll_SSE3.dll) in the same directory as a file that is associated with Corel FastFlick.
- The victim must then open the file, which triggers the vulnerable DLL loading process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to write files to the file system.
- The attacker needs to be able to entice the user to open the file associated with Corel FastFlick.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the affected DLLs
