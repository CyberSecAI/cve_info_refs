SUMMARY

The latest ﬁrmware update for the Siemens SCALANCE X-300 switch family and SCALANCE X 408
ﬁxes two vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to cause a device reboot under certain
conditions. An attacker must have network access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Siemens recommends protecting network access to all products except for perimeter devices with

appropriate mechanisms

• It is advised to follow recommended security practices (see http://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/

recommended-practices)

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2014-8478

The web server of the affected switches could allow unauthenticated users to cause a device reboot if
malformed HTTP requests are sent to the web server (port 80/tcp or port 443/tcp). To achieve this,
an attacker must be able to reach the HTTP interface over the network. No packets are forwarded to
connected devices until the reboot is completed.

Vulnerability CVE-2014-8479

The FTP server of the affected switches could allow authenticated users to cause a device reboot if
specially crafted network packets are sent to the FTP server (port 21/tcp). No packets are forwarded
to connected devices until the reboot is completed.
