- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FTP server of the affected switches does not properly validate input, which allows an attacker to cause a device reboot by sending specially crafted network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack results in a device reboot, causing a denial-of-service condition. The device will not forward network packets to connected devices until the reboot is complete.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via the FTP protocol (port 21/tcp).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to reach the FTP interface over the network and must have valid credentials to authenticate to the FTP server.
