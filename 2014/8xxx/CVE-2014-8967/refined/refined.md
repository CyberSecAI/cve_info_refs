- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer manages the lifetimes of HTML element objects (CElement objects) using reference counting. By using a CSS style `display:run-in` and performing specific manipulations, an attacker can cause the reference count of an object to drop to zero prematurely, leading to the object being freed. Subsequently, Internet Explorer continues to access this freed object, resulting in a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability in how Internet Explorer handles HTML element objects after they have been freed. The vulnerability occurs due to incorrect reference counting when using `display:run-in`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code under the context of the current process by exploiting this use-after-free vulnerability. This could potentially give the attacker the same user rights as the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves convincing a user to visit a specially crafted malicious web page or open a malicious file. Attackers could leverage compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content. Attackers would need to persuade users to click a link or open an attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or distribute a malicious file. They would also need to persuade a user to interact with this malicious content.
