Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-8557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Channel software. Specifically, the software fails to sanitize user-supplied data in the "usuario.nome" variable on the user profile editing page and the "titulo.form" variable on the ticket creation page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored on the server and executed when other users access the affected page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The software doesn't sanitize user-controlled input before storing it in the database or rendering it on web pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable fields. This code would then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages.
- **Account Hijacking:** By executing JavaScript, the attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account hijacking.
- **Data Manipulation:** Malicious scripts could be used to manipulate or alter the content of web pages.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could redirect users to phishing websites or other malicious content.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Channel software. Specifically:
  - Editing a user's profile, using the "usuario.nome" field.
  - Creating a new ticket, using the "titulo.form" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker must have a valid account on the Channel platform.
- **Access to Vulnerable Pages:** The attacker needs to have access to the user profile editing page and the ticket creation page.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in version 5.0.33_CCB of Channel software, but other versions may also be affected.
- The vulnerable fields are located in the following pages:
  - `.../channel/usuario.do?action=editarUsuario&id=XXX` (User profile edit page)
