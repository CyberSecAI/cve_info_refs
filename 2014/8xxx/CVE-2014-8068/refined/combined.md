# Adobe’s e-book reader sends your reading logs back to Adobe—in plain text [Updated]

Digital Editions even tracks which pages you've read. It might break a New Jersey Law.

Adobe’s Digital Editions e-book and PDF reader—an application used by thousands of libraries to give patrons access to electronic lending libraries—actively logs and reports every document [readers](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S1000/967_R2.HTM) add to their local “library” along with what users do with those files. Even worse, the logs are transmitted over the Internet in the clear, allowing anyone who can monitor network traffic (such as the National Security Agency, Internet service providers and cable companies, or others sharing a public Wi-Fi network) to follow along over readers’ shoulders.

Ars has independently verified the logging of e-reader activity with the use of a packet capture tool. The exposure of data was [first discovered by Nate Hoffelder of *The Digital Reader*](http://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/06/adobe-spying-users-collecting-data-ebook-libraries/#.VDP-8ildW2_), who reported the issue to Adobe but received no reply.

Digital Editions (DE) has been used by many public libraries as a recommended application for patrons wanting to borrow electronic books (particularly with the [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) e-book lending system), because it can enforce digital rights management rules on how long a book may be read for. But DE also reports back data on e-books that have been purchased or self-published. Those logs are transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection back to a server at Adobe—a server with the Domain Name Service hostname “adelogs.adobe.com”—as an unencrypted file (the data format of which appears to be JSON).

The behavior is part of Adobe's way of managing access to e-books borrowed from a library or "lent" by other users through online bookstores supporting the EPUB book format, such as Barnes & Noble. If you've "activated" Digital Editions with an Adobe ID, it uses that information to determine whether a book has been "locked" on another device using the same ID to read it or if the loan has expired. If the reader isn't activated, it uses an anonymous unique ID code generated for each DE installation.

Below is the data transmitted by Digital Editions when we opened an EPUB file of Yotam Ottolenghi’s cookbook, *Jerusalem*:

[![](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/datacapture-de.png)](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/datacapture-de.png)

DE reported back each EPUB document opened and the navigation within the document, recording each page number viewed in a stream of activity data back to an application called “datacollector.” The XML data is logged locally by the application, and then transmitted each time the application is opened—likely as part of Adobe’s DRM enforcement within DE. No data was transmitted for PDF documents opened.

A review of Adobe's terms of use for DE found no mention of the logging feature or how long the data was stored by Adobe. While checking the license data for books in DE’s local library is certainly part of the application’s core functionality, the fact that this data is broadcast in the clear could create a significant privacy issue for readers. It's not clear how the data collected by Adobe is stored, but it is associated with a unique identifier for each Digital Editions installation that can be associated with an Internet Protocol address when logged. And the fact that the data is broadcast in the clear by Digital Editions is directly in conflict with the privacy guidelines of many library systems, which closely guard readers' book loan data.

***Update, 4:45 PM*:** The unencrypted transmission of reader data, along with an apparent lack of coverage of the collection of that data in Adobe'e terms of service, may be in violation of a recently passed New Jersey Law, the [Reader Privacy Act](http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/S1000/967_R1.HTM). And the collection has also raised concern among librarians. The American Library Association's Code of Ethics states, "We protect each library user's right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received, and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted."

In a phone interview with Ars Technica, Deorah Caldwell-Stone, the deputy director of the American Library Association's Office for Intellectual Freedom, said that the ALA was still investigating the issue. "We are looking at this, and very concerned about this," she said, and If the data were to pertain to any library transactions, "we would want this information encrypted and private."

An Adobe spokesperson provided the following statement:

> Adobe Digital Editions allows users to view and manage eBooks and other digital publications across their preferred reading devices—whether they purchase or borrow them. All information collected from the user is collected solely for purposes such as license validation and to facilitate the implementation of different licensing models by publishers. Additionally, this information is solely collected for the eBook currently being read by the user and not for any other eBook in the user’s library or read/available in any other reader. User privacy is very important to Adobe, and all data collection in Adobe Digital Editions is in line with the end user license agreement and the Adobe Privacy Policy.

Here's what Adobe says they collect:

* **User ID:**this is the user's Adobe ID or an anonymous ID for an unactivated version of DE.
* **Device ID:** a unique identifier for the computer running DE, "collected for digital right management (DRM) purposes since publishers typically restrict the number of devices an eBook or digital publication can be read on," Adobe's spokesperson said.
* **Certified App ID:** a key that allows DE to open documents protected by DRM from being opened with unauthorized software.
* **Device IP address:** for geo-location, "since publishers have different pricing models in place depending on the location of the reader purchasing a given eBook or digital publication," Adobe's spokesperson said.
* **Duration for Which the Book was Read:** "This information is collected to facilitate limited or metered pricing models where publishers or distributors charge readers based on the duration a book is read," said Adobe's spokesperson.
* **Percentage of the Book Read:** Believe it or not, some publishers charge based on how much you read of a book—you may be only charged a percentage of the total if you don't finish it.

The end-user license for Digital Editions states that "the Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without additional notice and on an intermittent or regular basis, to automatically connect to the Internet to facilitate Customer’s access to content and services that are provided by Adobe or third parties... In addition, the Software may, without additional notice, automatically connect to the Internet to update downloadable materials from these online services so as to provide immediate availability of these services even when Customer is offline."  The EULA also refers to Adobe's privacy policy, which states that the company will "provide reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information."

It's clear from testing that data is sent on more than just the book currently being read—in our test, data was provided from a "scan" of all documents currently in the library. Additionally, it's not clear why all this data is sent regardless of the source of the book—even EPUB documents that are DRM-free get all their data shipped back to Adobe.

***Update, 6:23 PM ET:*** An Adobe spokesperson now says the company is working on an update. "In terms of the transmission of the data collected, Adobe is in the process of working on an update to address this issue," the spokesperson said in an e-mail to Ars Technica. "We will notify you when a date for this update has been determined."

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Adobe is Spying on Users, Collecting Data on Their eBook Libraries

06.10.2014

![](data:image/svg+xml...)![](https://the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13844066275_2ea2f384e01.jpg)

[![13844066275_2ea2f384e0[1]](data:image/svg+xml...)![13844066275_2ea2f384e0[1]](https://the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/13844066275_2ea2f384e01-250x167.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/122969584%40N07/13844066275/)Adobe has just given us a graphic demonstration of how not to handle security and privacy issues.

A hacker acquaintance of mine has tipped me to a huge security and privacy violation on the part of Adobe. That anonymous acquaintance was examining Adobe’s DRM for educational purposes when they noticed that Digital Editions 4, the newest version of Adobe’s Epub app, seemed to be sending an awful lot of data to Adobe’s servers.

My source told me, and I can confirm, that Adobe is tracking users in the app and uploading the data to their servers. (Adobe was contacted in advance of publication, but declined to respond.)  **Edit**: [Adobe responded Tuesday night](https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/07/adobe-responds-reports-spying-half-truths-misleading-statements/#.VDRpCvldWIV).

### **Update Timeline**

* [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/10/adobes-e-book-reader-sends-your-reading-logs-back-to-adobe-in-plain-text/) independently confirms many details.
* A second confirmation comes in from [Liza Daly of Safari Books](https://twitter.com/liza/status/519491816274817024).
* Tests show that earlier versions of Adobe DE [don’t spy on users](https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/07/adobe-digital-editions-3-probably-safe-adobes-spying-experts-say/).
* [Adobe responds](https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/07/adobe-responds-reports-spying-half-truths-misleading-statements/).
* Bluefire [comments on the story](https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/08/bluefire-comments-adobe-spying-scandal-thing-baby/).
* [Adobe responds to the ALA](https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/14/adobe-responds-ala-spying-scandal-fictitious-misleading-statements/#.VD1dE_ldWIU) (and what I’ve learned since this story broke)
* [Digital Editions 4.0.1 is released](https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/10/23/adobe-updates-digital-edition-stops-sharing-user-info-internet/), and does not spy on users.
* The [EFF confirms](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/10/what-we-can-learn-adobe-e-reader-mess) all of my initial report.

And just to be clear, I have seen this happen, and I can also tell you that [Benjamin Daniel Mussler](http://b.fl7.de/2014/09/amazon-stored-xss-book-metadata.html), the security researcher who [found the security hole on Amazon.com](https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/09/15/amazon-account-can-hacked-via-kindle-ebook/), has also tested this at my request and saw it with his own eyes.

Adobe is gathering data on the ebooks that have been opened, which pages were read, and in what order. All of this data, including the title, publisher, and other metadata for the book is being sent to Adobe’s server in clear text.

I am not joking; Adobe is not only logging what users are doing, they’re also sending those logs to their servers in such a way that anyone running one of the servers in between can listen in and know everything.

But wait, there’s more.

Adobe isn’t just tracking what users are doing in DE4; this app was also scanning my computer, gathering the metadata from all of the ebooks sitting on my hard disk, and uploading that data to Adobe’s servers.

**In. Plain. Text.**

And just to be clear, this includes not just ebooks I opened in DE4, but also ebooks I store in calibre and every Epub ebook I happen to have sitting on my hard disk.

**Update**: Further testing has revealed that the files being scanned were actually on my ereader, not my HD. I had not used ADE to load the files on to the ereader, and yet the app scanned them, made a list, and uploaded the list to Adobe.

And just to show that I am neither exaggerating nor on drugs, here is proof.

* [ADE-4-datacollector](https://the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ADE-4-datacollector.txt)
* [data from adobe](https://the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/data-from-adobe.txt)

The first file proves that Adobe is tracking users in the app, while the second one shows that Adobe is indexing my ebook collection.

The above two files were generated using data collected by an app called Wireshark. This nifty little app can be used to log all of the information that is sent or received by your computer over a network. Muussler and I both saw that data was being sent to 192.150.16.235, one of Adobe’s IP addresses. Wireshark logged all of the data sent to Adobe, and on request spat out the text files.

[![3478950798_ac6ae2344e[1]](data:image/svg+xml...)![3478950798_ac6ae2344e[1]](https://the-digital-reader.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/3478950798_ac6ae2344e1.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/arturodonate/3478950798/)

This is a privacy and security breach so big that I am still trying to wrap my head around the technical aspects, much less the legal aspects.

On a technical level, this kind of mistake is not new. Numerous apps have been caught sending data in clear text, and others have been caught scraping data without permission (email address books, for example). What’s more, LG was caught in a very similar privacy violation [last November](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131119/06503625288/lg-smart-tv-caught-collecting-data-files-stored-connected-usb-drives.shtml) when one of their Smart TVs was shown to be uploading metadata from a user’s private files to LG’s servers – and like Adobe, that data was sent in clear text.

I am sharing these details not to excuse or justify Adobe, but to show you that this was a massively boneheaded stupid mistake that Adobe would have seen coming had they had the brains of a goldfish.

As for the legal aspects, I am still unsure of just how many privacy laws have been violated. Most states have privacy laws about library books, so if this app was installed in a library or used with a library ebook then those laws may have been violated. What’s more, Adobe may have also violated the data protection sections of FERPA, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, and similar laws passed by [states like California](http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/2014/09/_landmark_student-data-privacy.html). (I’m going to have to let a lawyer answer that.)

And then there are the European privacy laws, some of which make US laws look lax.

Speaking of Europe, the Frankfurt Book Fair is coming up later this week. Adobe will be exhibiting at the trade show, and something tells me they will not be having a nice trip. (I for one hope that the senior management is detained for questioning.)

In any case, I would highly recommend that users avoid running Adobe’s apps for the near future – ever again, for that matter. Luckily for us, there are alternatives.

Rather than use Adobe DE 4, I would suggest using an app provided by Amazon, Google, Apple, or Kobo. Amazon uses the Kindle format, and each of the last three ebook platforms uses their own unique DRM and Epub (-ish) file format inside their apps. (While Google and Kobo will let you download an ebook which can be read in Adobe DE, that DRM is not used internally by either Kobo or Google.)

None of those 4 platforms are susceptible to Adobe’s security hole.

Of course, I can’t say for sure whether those platforms are more secure and private than Adobe’s, but I’m sure they will be made more secure in the next few weeks.

So, it only looks at epubs?

So it targets Kobo, Google, and Nook, but not Amazon?

Heh.

Google doesn’t download apps to your PC, so it’s out. And for all I know it might be able to scrape Kindle files as well.

Reception of eBooksStore at launch was mixed. Reviewers noted that it was still glitchy, and that books lacked reviews even for those that were centuries old.[6] Also others remarked that Google touted the EBookStore as "open", but that it was still using Adobe’s Adept eBooks Digital rights management.[7]

This is one of those complicated technical points which are difficult to explain.

For one thing, Google doesn’t have a Play Books app for Windows, so you read the ebooks in a web browser. Each ebook is sent in chunks, and is encrypted in Google’s own DRM.

For the record, Google doesn’t use Adobe DRM internally. They will sell you an ebook and let you download an Epub file, but if you read that ebook in a Play Books app you won’t be reading an Epub file; it will be something different:

https://the-digital-reader.com/2014/01/31/google-play-books-doesnt-support-epub-crazy-possibilities/

And so any ebook read inside a Google Play Books app is safe from Adobe’s snooping.

Weird, isn’t it?

Nasty thought: are they looking for "disinfected" versions of DRM’ed ebooks?

I’m not really a tinfoil hat guy but that thought occurred to me as well. There’s absolutely no reason for any program to sift through your computer, especially since permission wasn’t asked. I didn’t have a particularly high opinion of Adobe but this caper has lowered it quite a bit more.

Is it only in Adobe DE 4 or can we see the same thing with earlier version of the software?

I don’t know, but now that I know what to look for I plan to check earlier versions of the app.

DE 3 does not do this, we tested DE 3 extensively for exactly that before deploying.

I didn’t find this leak in ADE3 either.

I’m not surprised to learn that you tested the app; I am more surprised that Adobe didn’t expect that someone would run security tests on the app and find this issue.

That said, I guess all ebooks sellers are "spying" on their users somehow. They all collect data of what we read. But maybe it’s more "secure".

They collect data on books bought from them to some extent or another. Books aren’t bought from Adobe (they aren’t a seller), plus Adobe is collecting info on books not even associated with their app.

Wonder what they ALA will think. They’re pretty big on eBook reader privacy IIRC and most library systems use ADE as a download method.

This blew up on library Twitter this morning, and several folks who I know are involved in leadership positions at ALA are now getting the wheels turning. I would expect some sort of statement, at the very least, relatively soon.

This blew up on library Twitter this morning, and several folks who I know are involved in leadership positions at ALA are now getting the wheels turning. I would expect some sort of statement, at the very least, relatively soon.

I am a member of the board of LITA, the technology division of ALA, and brought this issue to the board this morning. It is also being discussed by ALA Council right now. I suspect there are numerous other groups within ALA that will have an opinion, and that we’ll be wanting to speak with a coordinated voice.

Thank you for bringing this to everyone’s attention. Stay tuned 🙂

Thank you for the heads up.

On an unrelated note, I just posted an article about 3M Cloud Library’s new hardware program. Can you read the post and tell me if my concerns are well founded? Thanks!

I am not an expert in the cases here (I mean, I followed them from a distance, but IANAL), but I would have the same concerns as you, and I would want to consult someone who IS an expert if I were in a decision-making role for a program like this.

Yes but you would not have the Adobe Digital Editions on your system if it wasn’t for their DRM.

That’s not true. On Mac, there are only a few good ePub readers and Adobe Digital Editions was one of them. I installed it just to proof my ePubs before uploading to B&N, Kobo, etc., not because I had to read something that had DRM on it. Now I have deleted ADE, and I guess I’ll use the iBooks app for the time being.

@wrecks I use calibre probably more than any other single program except my browser, but you still have to use Adobe if you buy DRM books. Nate’s pushing Google and Kobo, but even IF you use Kobo, you use ADE internally (perhaps not with the same "features", but the software — RMSDK — is purchased from Adobe), and I don’t like using either of those in ways that tie me to a platform or vendor. So I download to ADE, and then sideload to my ereader.

I’m a bit surprised that there are people here using ADE 2, still, as mine stopped working (would no longer get a valid authentication from their server) and I was forced to upgrade to ADE 3. So one day, I expect something similar will force me to move to ADE4.

Telling people not to buy DRM books is not a solution: as long as publishers use DRM, not buying DRM books is letting them choose my reading (there aren’t many books that are legally available in both a DRM and non-DRM format). We have to campaign to force them to stop using DRM: preferably by educating authors and agents to stop agreeing to publishing contracts that insist on it.

I was only pushing Kobo because many readers will want ebooks that only come with DRM. I myself strip the DRM.

"even IF you use Kobo, you use ADE internally"

Not really, no. I have been told by a several expert Kobo users that they have 2 rendering engines, one for their own content and one for external Epubs.

I would be willing to provide either or both installers to a platform if needed. ADE 2.0 installer is File Version 2.0.1.0 &

Kobo’s kepubs use a different rendering engine, but they’re still using Adobe’s RMSDK afaik — which, to be fair, isn’t invading our privacy like ADE4, but still means you’re encumbered by DRM and Adobe’s got their hands on your data.

A few users further up say that ADE2 & possibly ADE3 don’t have this problem, and that you can still download these older versions from the adobe website – as long as you make sure you use the old versions, you and other students should be okay.

I suggest letting your local libraries know, though, because librarians can be very militant about user privacy and they’ll be well placed to advise or kick up a stink.

From my own experimentation, it looks like the best way to thwart this in the short-term is by editing the hosts file and directing adelogs.adobe.com to either 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1. I hope we can expect Adobe to address this issue quickly. I sent them an e-mail about my own concerns a little while ago.

No, that’s just the logging server. The licensing server is separate, and fortunately they do communicate with that one over an encrypted connection.

Perhaps this lovely snooping feature was designed to facilitate syncing bookmarks and notes between multiple devices, but if so Adobe never bothered to ask my permission first. Apart from debugging code inadvertently shipped with the final release, that’s the only innocuous use I can think of.

I reinstalled ADE to read the terms, and I can’t find any place such behavior is consented to. Unfortunately I do need ADE 4 installed for the work I do, so for now blocking the connection to the logging server will have to suffice.

\* "innocuous" in the sense of providing value to some users. Syncing isn’t something I would need or consent to. I expect a company to make clear what data they are collecting and why, and when transmitting approved data to handle it responsibly, not send it in clear text like this.

The way they would be logging bookmarks in this particular case (at X page turn, location Y. at Z, page turn, location A… instead of at last use, location X). Either it is incompetence\* or something quite different.

\* Could be incompetence. After all, ADE is developed in India on a tiny budget and it seems they are out-sourcing in China (could) and Romania (is for sure).

May be you made a typo of some sort. An IP-adress starting with 192 is an unroutable, i.e. local(on your computer) ip-adress. But it could be of course that the information is gathered first on your computer and then sent to Adobe.

My guess is that it’s a debugging remnant, left by one of Adobe’s programmers.

Well strictly speaking 192.0.2.0/24 is also unroutable.

If you look at Adobe’s AS (Autonomous System) they have a number of subnets – http://bgp.he.net/AS44786#\_prefixes

I did some other digging and it looks like Adobe has had this domain also resolve to 193.104.215.99 – that looks to be Adobe Europe in Ireland. I’m guessing that’s classic geographical routing to the closest IP so that European data doesn’t leave Europe

Interestingly I did a quick check from Japan and it looks like I have a 50% chance of going to Europe or the US.

In both cases adelogs.adobe.com is CNAMEd to adelogs.wip4.adobe.com and that is the FQDN that can resolv e to one of the two IPs.

Someone upthread worried that blocking "adelogs.adobe.com" would block some of the DRM activation bits of ADE. As far as I can tell from a cursory scan this is unlikely to be the case. Adobe also has hosts like "activate.adobe.com" which seems more likely to be the activation server. Since there is also "update.adobe.com" and "download.adobe.com" and so I I think adelogs really is just a logging server.

If you do want to block all of Adobe then \*.wip4.adobe.com would probably work wonders, but I suspect that really WILL break anything you have from Adobe that tries to call home, including, say, flash for update checking.

According to ARIN:

"Addresses starting with "192.0.2.", "198.51.100.", or "203.0.113." are reserved for use in documentation and sample configurations. They should never be used in a live network configuration. No one has permission to use these addresses on the Internet."

192.0.2.0/24 is reserved for documentation and examples and ARIN tells network operators that they SHOULD block those addresses in their routers, not MUST. The comment from ARIN ends with:

"These blocks are not for local use, and the filters may be used in both local and public contexts."

Your subnet mask isn’t quite right. 192.168.0.0/16 isn’t publicly routed. In other words, 192.168.anything.anything is a private address.

192.anything except 168.anything.anything is, by convention, a public address.

Another reason not to buy any books with DRM, ever (as this will bind you to Adobe’s platform). I will uninstall this software as soon as I’m home today, and good riddance.

Companies are still thinking they can pull this sort of stunt and here they are getting caught out again. Even better is the 'no comment' from the supplier, I bet they will be coming out with the excuses shortly and they will be lame.

Great work in getting to the bottom of this. In any case, another reason to buy a real book instead of drm ridden ebooks.

Thanks for this Nate.

We have thousands of publisher books on our production workstations, many under non-disclosure agreements. Fortunately we have not yet rolled ADE4 out for testing (because it can’t handle inline images amongst other silly things).

This is a timely warning of corporate irresponsibility. We will ensure our publisher production contacts are all made aware of this. From a production facility perspective this is somewhat intimidating. If someone wants to ADE4 test a book under non-disclosure it will have to be on an isolated workstation modified as Michael mentioned. For us that will become a production services sales feature!

On a last note: It’s one thing that they are sending this private and privileged content back to their servers in clear-text, but really, their JSON sucks. If they are going to steal private information, couldn’t they do it with professional flair and sensible key names rather than this schoolboy code!

Adobe has a privacy policy, as well as the ADE EULA, and has issued a statement on them: http://www.infodocket.com/2014/10/07/new-and-old-serious-reader-privacy-concerns-both-inside-and-outside-the-library/

I’ve glanced at both and…hell if I know if I agreed to it, honestly. This information isn’t all specifically referenced. You could make a case it’s covered anyway. That case would go against some people’s moral intuitions. I really have no idea.

With the ebooks they sell you, yes, but they kinda have to do that so they can sync your reading position across your account. And so far as I know the data is at least obscured (I will be checking).

And it’s the retailer that gets the data, not a third party as is the case with Adobe DRM encumbered ebooks.

Adobe is a third party, I wonder how much of the data it shares whith the e-booksellers…

Adobe is (unfortunately) not the only one…

Let’s read the « licence » file displayed by my « Pocketbook Touch Lux 2 » reader (that also comes with AdobeViewer inside, that makes things a little funnier…)

Now Go Read And Despair :

1/ The licence comes in english, which probably makes it plain illegal here in France, coming with a "general public" device that my Grand’Ma can purchase.

2/ It reads : « POCKETBOOK RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AMEND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE FROM TIME TO TIME BY PLACING NEW EDITIONS HEREOF AT: http://www.pocketbook-int.com/legal/SLA. EACH NEW EDITION OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT SHALL COME TO EFFECT AT THE DATE OF PLACEMENT AT THE MENTIONED WEB PAGE AND THIS IS THEREFORE RECOMMENDED THAT YOU PERIODICALLY VISIT THAT PAGE… »

=> Wow. They can change without notice the rights you have to use an hardware device that you have puchased and own ? And you’d be supposed to go and check every other week ? A clause that allows one part to unilaterally modify a contract after it has been "concluded" is most certainly illegal…

3/ But the finest still is to come :

« Information Received.Â The software will provide Pocketbook with data about your Pocketbook reading device and its interaction with the Service (such as available memory, up-time, log files, and signal strength). The Software will also provide Pocketbook with information related to the Digital Content on your Pocketbook reading device and Supported Devices and your use of it (such as last page read and content archiving). Information provided to Pocketbook, including annotations, bookmarks, notes, highlights, or similar markings you make using your Pocketbook reading device or Reading Application, may be stored on servers that are located outside the country in which you live. […] BY USING THE POCKETBOOK READING DEVICE YOU AUTOMATICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT POCKETBOOK MAY COLLECT, STORE, PROCESS, TRANSMIT, PROVIDE AND/OR SELL ANY INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT YOU AND THE READING DEVICE(S) THAT YOU ARE USING TO ANY THIRD PARTIES. THIS INFORMATION MAY BE USED BY POCKETBOOK AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION FOR ANY LAWFUL PURPOSES AND IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, WITHOUT LIMITATION.

Well done bringing this to light, Nate.

Perhaps this fuckup, coming as close as it does to the FBF, will make the big publishing houses reconsider their relationship with Adobe. After all, they’ve been laying on the whole "guardians of the enlightenment" shtick pretty thick recently as part of their fight against Amazon. It will be hard to reconcile that stance with complicity in a system that effectively hands oppressive governments the world over a list of people’s seditious reading habits.

I’ll also try to remember to post a comment when a statement is released — but note that it may take a couple days or so; ALA is not always the fastest-moving of organizations.

I am glad I have stayed with ADE 2.0, right now. And that I strip DRM. That said, I am seriously considering ditching ADE and going with Bluefire instead. Especially since they have just launched a Windows version.

Unfortunately, Google uses Adobe Digital Editions DRM. I’ve downloaded books from Google Play and ended up with acsm files.

Google also sell DRM-free books, but it’s not easy to browse for just those or even determine which books have DRM, so I end up buying from Amazon.

On Kobo, if you save a preview to your library, you can see what type of file it is. It’s usually listed as EPUB (DRM-free) or Adobe DRM EPUB.

> The first file proves that Adobe is tracking users in the app, while the second one shows that Adobe is indexing my ebook collection.

I’ve pretty-printed the [ADE-4 data collector> and the](https://gist.github.com/broofa/8f394853017194a35164) [data from adobe](https://gist.github.com/broofa/deb396e5af03a5f46540) files you provide for easier reading.

This data doesn’t look like "user tracking" to me. It looks more like diagnostic data to be used in understanding bugs and crashes. I.e. Adobe isn’t monitoring their users so much as they’re monitoring the behavior of their own application. I know this is arguing semantics – and I’m not saying this data isn’t sensitive – but statements like "Adobe is tracking their users!" may be unfairly representing what’s actually taking place. Odds are this stuff is going into a "bug tracking database" rather than a "user tracking database". Semantics, I know. :-/

The file scanning behavior is interesting, but also debatable. It doesn’t seem that unreasonable for an e-book reader to index a users hard-drive looking for books. I would say it mostly depends on where on your hard-drive it’s looking for those books. There’s no file paths listed in the data you provide though, so I won’t comment further here.

As for sending this data in clear text… technically there’s no *personally identifiable* information in the files you’ve provided. No email addresses or user IDs, nor credit card information or street addresses – it’s simply generic data about user actions (e.g. "navigated to page") and meta-data about books (title, creator, subject, publisher). Is this sensitive information? Perhaps, but it’s certainly not on the level of bank account credentials or anything like that. Again, debatable.

Who is to say how the odds fall? And even if your scenario is correct and Adobe’s intention was simply to gather data for bug reporting purposes, that at best establishes an upper bound on the magnitude of Adobe’s misbehavior here.

The data is being gathered and sent to Adobe’s servers without explicit consent on the part of the user — not even the public release notes and the license agreement for the software do not seem to give any hint that DE 4.0 is doing this. That’s bad enough: if you don’t need data on user behavior for your software to work, you shouldn’t be collecting it in the first place. And if you do need it — there is no excuse to ever transmit it to the clear.

True, reading data is not bank data — but there are plenty of governments that ban books, censor books, or otherwise have an interest in what their citizens are reading — including, at times, the US. Protecting the freedom to read what one wants — which necessarily includes protecting privacy — is a core professional value of librarians, which is why librarians are among the groups that are rather concerned by this news.

And there’s the rub. There are certain categories of problems where it’s extremely helpful to have a log of what [application] activity happened prior to a bug or crash occurring. And often (especially in the case of crashes) there’s no way to gather that data retroactively – meaning the only way to get this data for users that experience such problems is to gather it for all users.

> but there are plenty of governments…

Non-sequitur. Adobe is not the Government.

> protecting privacy — a core professional value of librarians

From [the Adobe Privacy Policy page that the Digital Editions 4.0 Software License Agreement links to](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html)(in Sec 14.1.2, "Internet Connectivity and Privacy"), we have the following (This is what you are agreeing to when you install DE4, btw – emphasis mine) …

> **Adobe websites and applications**
>
> We collect information about how you use our websites and applications, including when you use a desktop product feature that takes you online (such as a photo syncing feature). We may collect information that your browser or device typically sends to our servers whenever you visit an Adobe website, or when an Adobe desktop product feature takes you online. For example, **your browser or device may tell us your IP address (which may tell us generally where you are located) and the type of browser and device you used**. When you visit an Adobe website, your browser may also tell us information such as the page that led you to our website and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our website. Adobe may collect information about how you use our websites and applications by using cookies and similar technologies, and our servers may collect similar information when you are logged in to the website or application. **Depending on the website or application, this information may be anonymous (for example, see the Adobe Product Improvement Program) or it may be associated with you** (for example, see the Creative Cloud FAQ).

This is what you agree to when you use or install *any Adobe product*. Even if Adobe is gathering personal information (which hasn’t been established yet), they’re still acting within the bounds of their privacy policy.

It’s not a non-sequitur to suggest that governments might care what we’re reading. Knowing that Adobe *has* that information, the Department of Homeland Security may very well ask for it (well, demand it…). Except that, since it’s transmitted in the clear, the NSA *already* has it.

When they start scanning books outside your ADE library, they are going well beyond the terms of their EULA. And it’s moot anyway if collecting the information they do is illegal where you live: and I’d venture to say that for a private company to collect that much *is* illegal in most countries.

"And often (especially in the case of crashes) there’s no way to gather that data retroactively – meaning the only way to get this data for users that experience such problems is to gather it for all users."

This statement is technically incorrect. Any programmer capable of logging to the network is also able to writing that same log to memory. Plenty of applications will write the last ten to hundred actions to an in-memory journal. If the application triggers a crash handler then resulting crash dump will still contain the journal. Not only does the crash handler get the actions "retroactively" but only sends it if the application crashes instead of continually. A well written crash handler also gets consent from the user while making them aware of what information will be transmitted and why.

What is even more damning is that ADE4 includes cryptography functions as part of it’s DRM. It should have been trivial to encrypt the logging. Instead it is announcing to the entire network what is being read. That means if the device is associated with a public wifi such as at a public library or Starbucks, then anyone that cares to listen is notified of what you are using ADE4 to read. Even if the public wifi itself uses encryption such as WPA, anyone else has the password to join the wifi still gets access to the ADE4 log packets. This is not acceptable even if being able to debug the application and "improve" the customer experience is the goal.

Of course, if they’d encrypted the data they were stealing from us, we wouldn’t know what they were stealing!

[…] A brief history of the Adobe book spying story   Nate Hoffelder at The Digital Reader reported Monday, “Adobe is gathering data on the ebooks that have been opened, which pages were read, and in what order. All of this data, including the title, publisher, and other metadata for the book is being sent to Adobe’s server in clear text…   “Adobe isn’t just tracking what users are doing in DE4; this app was also scanning my computer, gathering the metadata from all of the ebooks sitting on my hard disk, and uploading that data to Adobe’s servers.”   Adobe responded, “All information collected from the user is collected solely for purposes such as license validation and to facilitate the implementation of different licensing models by publishers… User privacy is very important to Adobe…”   Hoffelder commented, “I don’t know about you, but I don’t see how sending a user’s reading history in clear text over the web could possibly be in line with a privacy policy.”   “Update: [from Digital Book World] Adobe acknowledges that transmitting unencrypted data could pose a security risk: “In terms of the transmission of the data collected, Adobe is in the process of working on an update to address this issue.” Adobe says further that more information on when that update will be in place and of what it will consist is forthcoming.”   And Adobe used to be such a nice company.

The OverDrive app for libraries recently dropped the Adobe ID sign-up process (thank god). Now you set up an OverDrive account the first time you open the app. But does anyone know if OverDrive is still connected with Adobe or if they are collecting metadata themselves?

Unfortunately some libraries, including mine (Seattle Public Library) are still locked into Adobe Epub editions of all of their ebooks and audiobooks (with a few exceptions). So even though OverDrive has dropped this requirement it may not help?

Our library (Cottonwood Public Library in Arizona) is the same. I’m curious to know still what OverDrive’s relationship with Adobe is. Does this breach mean that library users using the OverDrive app are having their metadata collected as well?

[…] TheDigitalReader nous alerte sur la politique suivie par Adobe avec sa version ADE4. Il serait enfin temps que les éditeurs européens agissent enfin solidairement pour clarifier les conditions dans lesquelles Adobe utilise les données de millions de lecteurs à travers toute l’Europe. C’est aussi à la Commission Européenne de se pencher sur ce problème, tant l’échelle est importante aujourd’hui avec le développement de la lecture numérique dans tous les pays. […]

Come on people, this is nothing new. All the big companies that make money off of meta data are doing this. What’s even scarier is that some companies that are supposed to be providing security to users are also skimming data without the users knowing it.

Do a Google search on "RSA Security backdoor" or just visit this link:

http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/31/us-usa-security-nsa-rsa-idUSBREA2U0TY20140331

Let’s just hope that these companies that are monetizing our usage habits don’t get in bed with the security companies that are supposed to be protecting us! Just imagine the room for trouble if that happens.

That’s not true. "all the big companies" certainly track my usage of their websites. They don’t all track my usage of software I’ve installed on my computer without telling me, and the few that do don’t call home in clear-text. And nobody is, legally, scanning my drive to see what other files I have that they may be interested in.

There is no reason to do business with Adobe — there are plenty of free ebook readers that do not spy on you: Calibre, FBReader, the Epub reader extension/web app for Firefox, IE and Safari.

Stick to DRM-free books that you can direct download to your computer — Smashwords, Weightless, RobotTradingCompany, RebellionStore, DriveThruFiction, BookViewCafe, and many other small vendors.

The selection on these sites is large and of very high quality…with none of the hassles.

The selection of those does NOT generally include anything new by established authors. I’m sorry, but I’m not going to stick to reading books that were published a century ago, or self-published recently by unknowns (though I read a LOT of those), just to make a point.

Of course it’s "*at all true.*" That’s two publishers in a niche market. I’m sure there are others, but still the vast majority of books I want to read are only legally available with DRM — and I’m even primarily interested in SF. If you read bestsellers, tough luck.

"Further testing has revealed that the files being scanned were actually on my ereader, not my HD. I had not used ADE to load the files on to the ereader, and yet the app scanned them, made a list, and uploaded the list to Adobe."

What?? Was this an ereader that was previously authorized to ADE or did the program automatically recognize it before it started hoovering data? I’m no computer whiz but that doesn’t sound like a bug. It also doesn’t jive with Adobe’s statement that the program doesn’t phone home with book information unless the book was actually opened by ADE. So did the program get curious, do a Max Headroom thing and say to itself, "Ooh, a cable? I wonder where it leads?"

It was not previously authorized to ADE, no. It just happened to be plugged in when I ran one of the test on ADE4.

I’m going to do a post, but at the moment I am working with the EFF to document this and understand it better.

This month I want to address the issue of patron privacy in the context of the recent revelations about privacy incursions in the latest version of Adobe Digital Editions (ADE)—specifically, the fact that version 4 of the e-reader software gathers highly specific data about individual users’ reading behavior and transmits it, unencrypted and with all identifying information included as well as other data culled from the user’s machine, back to Adobe. (A very useful running summary of the issue and details about how the situation is quickly evolving can be found at the Digital Reader blog.) […]

I’ve known for years that Adobe is up to no good. I remember the Flash cookies that you couldn’t remove in a decent way.

I removed Flash a couple of years so I don’t know how it’s managed now but for a very long time if you wanted to disable all Flash cookies… wel that wasn’t possible! You could only disable Flash cookies per website (opt-out). But how do you know which websites you will be visiting tomorrow or next week or next year? Well you don’t so by default cookies are created and then you need to disable them per website. And how do you disable them per website? Well by visiting the online Adobe configurator website of course that’s hosted on one of their domains that configures files on YOUR local computer.

And… I have just had a bizarre conversation with an adobe rep when I called to get a adobe digital publishing quote for developing an ebook we needed to create. They would only give me a price for their service if I gave them the clients name. He said because they might be dealing direct with the client. Firstly where is our data protection if we don’t want to give them the name at this stage we shouldn’t have to its our client not theirs and secondly it leaves you with the feeling that their aim is to leave out the middleman ie the design/web agency and deal direct with the end customer!

**Les bibliothèques publiques face à la protection des données privées : Saturne dévore ses enfants ? – Économie du document**
November 17, 2020 um 10:15 am

[…] De la grande Bibliothèque d’Alexandrie à la « bibliothèque du futur », l’imaginaire de la bibliothèque a forgé au fil du temps les paradigmes de nos sociétés et renouvelé notre manière d’appréhender l’information. La bibliothèque est depuis longtemps considérée comme un lieu de transmission du savoir et une « porte ouverte sur la connaissance ». Selon le Manifeste de l’Unesco (1994), elle prône le développement de la démocratie et la prise de décision en toute indépendance. Avec l’essor de la « civilisation numérique », pour reprendre l’expression de Jean-Louis Roy (président et directeur général de Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec), la technologie a permis de faire circuler l’information de manière plus fluide, plus rapide et plus démocratique. Pensons au livre numérique, à l’accès aux bases de données scientifiques et au wifi par exemple. Les bibliothèques sont aussi devenues, en contrepartie, de précieuses banques d’informations pour leurs fournisseurs. Entre « bien public » et « bien monnayable », les données personnelles des utilisateurs sont rapidement devenues le « nouveau pétrole ». Bien que la charte de BibLib stipule qu’aucune donnée personnelle des citoyens ne peut être collectée, ni transmise à des tiers en dehors des cas explicitement prévus par la loi, les bibliothèques entretiennent toutefois une position ambiguë et paradoxale avec la protection des données. Comment expliquer que 60% des bibliothèques de cégep du Québec utilisent un logiciel qui dirige les usagers vers le site Amazon alors qu’elles pourraient encourager les librairies locales et éduquer les usagers dans une prise de décision éclairée ? Même modus operandi du côté de Kindle. Amazon transforme la lecture en données personnelles en enregistrant l’historique d’usage (titres des documents, heures de lecture, passages surlignés, etc.). Selon l’ActuaLitté, les données recueillies « permettent de dresser le profil très précis d’un lecteur et donc de proposer aux annonceurs des publicités plus ciblées à diffuser, une des principales sources de revenus de la société dirigée par Jeff Bezos. » Que dire du logiciel Adobe Digital Editions qui tire profit du prêt numérique en bibliothèque grâce au digital rights management (DRM), un petit verrou qui contrôle les diverses utilisations du livre, dont le téléchargement, la durée du prêt et le transfert vers un appareil de lecture ? Conçu initialement pour protéger le droit d’auteur, Adobe collecte non seulement les lectures des usagers mais aussi les metadata des autres ebook sur …. […]
