Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8800:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The exploit-db entry explicitly mentions CVE-2014-8800 and the vulnerable software as "WordPress Plugin Nextend Facebook Connect 1.4.59".
   - The provided code snippet in the exploit-db content aligns with the vulnerability description.
   - Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the fact that the plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when updating plugin settings.
   - Specifically, the `stripslashes()` function is used, which is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks as it does not escape HTML entities.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The plugin takes user-provided data in the `$_POST` array, removes slashes, then stores the data in the WordPress options database via `update_option`. The stored data is then later rendered in the plugin, allowing for arbitrary JavaScript execution within the user's browser.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings by crafting a malicious POST request.
   - This injected JavaScript code will execute in the browsers of users accessing the plugin settings page or any other part of the site that uses this setting, potentially leading to:
     - Session hijacking
     - Defacement of the website
     - Redirection to malicious websites
     - Other malicious activities within the context of the victim's browser session.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the WordPress plugin settings page (specifically the `nextend-facebook-settings.php` file).

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the WordPress site, but does not require any particular privileges to do so, making this an unauthenticated attack.
   - No privileges are required, however the attacker needs to know or be able to guess a valid URL to target.

**7. Additional Details:**
    - The provided exploit code shows how an attacker could inject javascript code into the `fb_login_button` setting.
    - The exploit-db entry confirms the fix in version 1.5.1 of the plugin.
    - The WordPress.org content provides information about the plugin itself, it's features, installation and changelog, the relevant entry in the changelog reads: "Fix: Some third parties could end up breaking our “Page for register flow” and “OAuth redirect uri proxy page” select inputs" (note this does not mention the XSS vulnerability).
    - The WordPress.org content also mentions the commercial nature of the plugin: "This plugin is free but offers additional paid commercial upgrades or support".
    - The WordPress.org content also provides user reviews and ratings for the plugin.
    - The exploit-db entry provides the vulnerable version `1.4.59`, the updated version `1.5.1` and a link to the changelog `https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextend-facebook-connect/changelog/`

In summary, CVE-2014-8800 describes a stored XSS vulnerability in Nextend Facebook Connect plugin, which is caused by insufficient sanitization of plugin settings. This allows a remote attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of users accessing the plugin settings page or anywhere else the stored setting may be used.
