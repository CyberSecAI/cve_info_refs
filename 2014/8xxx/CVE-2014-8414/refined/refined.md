Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8414:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the internal bridging API used by the ConfBridge application within Asterisk. Specifically, under high call load, state transitions for channels within a conference bridge could be delayed. This delay could lead a hung-up channel to incorrectly transition to a state where it's waiting for media. Since the channel was remotely hung up, no further media arrives, causing the channel to remain indefinitely within ConfBridge.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper state management within the ConfBridge application's internal bridging API
- Delayed state transitions under high call load

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The hung channels consume resources, preventing legitimate users from joining conferences, effectively causing a DoS

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated sessions - attackers could initiate a high volume of calls and hang up to cause the vulnerable state and trigger the issue.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to place calls to an Asterisk server with access to ConfBridge
- Ability to generate high call load

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported on October 19, 2014, by Ben Klang, and a fix was released on November 20, 2014.
- Patches are available for both the open-source and Certified Asterisk versions 11.x.
- The vulnerability is identified by the security advisory AST-2014-014.
- The issue is tracked in the Asterisk issue tracker as ASTERISK-24440
- Fixed in Asterisk Open Source version 11.14.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.6-cert8
