               Asterisk Project Security Advisory - AST-2014-014

         Product        Asterisk
         Summary        High call load may result in hung channels in
                        ConfBridge.
    Nature of Advisory  Denial of Service
      Susceptibility    Remote Unauthenticated Sessions
         Severity       Moderate
      Exploits Known    No
       Reported On      19 October, 2014
       Reported By      Ben Klang
        Posted On       20 November 2014

         CVE Name       Pending

    Description  The ConfBridge application uses an internal bridging API to
                 implement conference bridges. This internal API uses a
                 state model for channels within the conference bridge and
                 transitions between states as different things occur. Under
                 load it is possible for some state transitions to be
                 delayed causing the channel to transition from being hung
                 up to waiting for media. As the channel has been hung up
                 remotely no further media will arrive and the channel will
                 stay within ConfBridge indefinitely.

    Resolution  The underlying bridging code that ConfBridge uses has been
                fixed so state changes can not occur that will take a
                channel out of the hung up state.
