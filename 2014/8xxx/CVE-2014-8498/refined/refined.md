Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a blind SQL injection flaw within the search functionality of Password Manager Pro (PMP) and Pro MSP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Blind SQL injection in the `SEARCH_ALL` parameter.
- Inadequate input sanitization, where single quotes are escaped with backslashes, but this can be bypassed by double escaping the backslashes (`\\'`).
- Injected strings are converted to uppercase, which complicates exploitation for some techniques but does not prevent all attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: A low-privileged user (e.g., a guest account) can escalate their privileges to "Super Administrator".
- Complete access: Super Administrators have access to all passwords in the system in unencrypted format.
- Data exfiltration:  The password database can be exported in CSV format, revealing all stored passwords in plaintext.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based:  The attack is performed by sending specially crafted POST requests to specific endpoints.
- Specifically, requests are sent to `/BulkEditSearchResult.cc` for CVE-2014-8498.
- The vulnerable parameter is `SEARCH_ALL`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated user: An attacker needs a valid user account to exploit the vulnerability (even a low-privileged guest account is sufficient).
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable PMP server.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter: The attacker must know that `SEARCH_ALL` is the injection point.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit can be used to inject SQL queries to update user roles and grant super admin privileges.
- A Metasploit module was created to automate the process.
- The vulnerability exists in multiple pages.
- The vulnerability affects versions of PMP before 7.1 build 7105
