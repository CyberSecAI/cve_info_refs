Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in ejabberd's handling of XMPP stream compression in conjunction with the `starttls_required` setting.  Specifically, the server was not enforcing TLS encryption if a client initiated stream compression before TLS was established, effectively allowing unencrypted communication despite the `starttls_required` configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of Encryption:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the `starttls_required` setting, resulting in unencrypted communication where encryption was expected. This is a violation of the server's configured security policy.
- **Lack of Enforcement:** The server failed to properly enforce the requirement for TLS encryption before allowing stream compression.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  An attacker could eavesdrop on the unencrypted communication, potentially exposing sensitive information transmitted between the client and the server, such as usernames, passwords, or message content.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** The lack of encryption also makes the connection susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker could intercept, modify, or inject malicious data into the communication stream.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **XMPP Client:** The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised XMPP client initiating a connection to an ejabberd server with `starttls_required` enabled and sending the compression request before `starttls` is negotiated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker would need network access to the ejabberd server.
- **XMPP Client Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to initiate an XMPP connection, request stream compression and possibly perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Awareness of Vulnerability:** The attacker must know how to exploit the specific flaw to bypass the TLS requirement.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves ensuring that stream compression is only allowed after TLS encryption has been successfully negotiated.
- The issue was reported by Hanno BÃ¶ck.
- Patches were created and applied to various distributions including Mageia, and upstream in ejabberd.
- The vulnerability was addressed by commit [7bdc115](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/commit/7bdc1151b). The specific code change enforces that TLS must be enabled (`TLSEnabled`) if TLS is required.
