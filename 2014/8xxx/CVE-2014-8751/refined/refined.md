Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8751:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the goYWP WebPress application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `search_param` parameter on the `/search.php` page and the `name`, `address`, and `comment` parameters on the `/forms.php` page. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), specifically a lack of input sanitization leading to stored XSS. This is categorized as CWE-79.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a variety of impacts, including:
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal user session cookies.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance of the website.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious sites or inject malware.
*   **Phishing:** Attackers could create fake login forms to steal user credentials.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are:
1.  **HTTP GET request to `/search.php`:**  The `search_param` parameter is vulnerable.
2.  **HTTP POST request to `/forms.php`:**  The `name`, `address`, and `comment` parameters are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   No special user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the XSS vulnerabilities.
