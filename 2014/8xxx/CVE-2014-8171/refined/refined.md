{
    "CVE-2014-8171": {
        "Root cause": "The Linux kernel's memory resource controller (memcg) had a flaw in its handling of OOM (out of memory) conditions.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Inadequate handling of OOM conditions leading to deadlocks."
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker could trigger a deadlock by continuously spawning new processes within a single memory-constrained cgroup during an OOM event, locking up the system.",
        "Attack vectors": [
            "Local exploitation by an attacker with the ability to spawn processes in a constrained cgroup."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to continuously create new processes within a memory-constrained cgroup on a vulnerable system."
    }
