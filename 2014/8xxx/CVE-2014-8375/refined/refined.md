Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of input sanitization of the `$_POST['selected_group']` parameter in the `GBgallery.php` file of the WordPress GB Gallery Slideshow plugin. This unsanitized input is directly used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query through the `selected_group` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database compromise:** A successful SQL injection can allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the WordPress database. This could include:
    - Extracting sensitive user information (usernames, passwords, emails).
    - Manipulating site content.
    - Gaining administrative access to the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **`selected_group` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected via the `selected_group` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the WordPress site.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to the WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the `selected_group` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Additional Information from Content:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `/wp-content/plugins/gb-gallery-slideshow/GBgallery.php`.
- The vulnerable version of the plugin is 1.5.
