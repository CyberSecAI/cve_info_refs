Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-8137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the `jas_iccattrval_destroy()` function within the JasPer library. This occurs when parsing ICC color profiles in JPEG 2000 image files. The `data.txt` pointer is freed twice due to a flawed error handling.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double-free vulnerability in `jas_iccattrval_destroy()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file can trigger the double-free, leading to:
    - Application crash (denial of service).
    - Potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted JPEG 2000 image files.
- An attacker tricks a user into opening a specially crafted JPEG 2000 image file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify JPEG 2000 image files.
- Ability to convince a user to open the malicious file.
