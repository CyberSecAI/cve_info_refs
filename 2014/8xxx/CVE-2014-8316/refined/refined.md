Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8316:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of validation of user-defined XML inputs in SAP BusinessObjects Explorer, coupled with the use of an XML interpreter that allows references to external entities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system (e.g., /etc/passwd as demonstrated in the provided example)
- This could lead to information disclosure of sensitive data.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, even by unauthenticated users due to vulnerable XML processing in login requests

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP requests to `/explorer/polestar_xml.jsp`.
- Specifically, by crafting malicious XML payloads within the `xmlParameter` parameter, attackers can specify external entities referencing local files.
- The `explorationSpaceUpdate` request can be used to store the malicious payload
- The `explorationSpaceDetail` request can be used to retrieve the content of the file specified in the malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not require prior authentication.
- They can send HTTP requests to the affected `/explorer/polestar_xml.jsp` endpoint.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft XML payloads and send them through HTTP POST requests.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in SAP BusinessObjects Explorer version 14.0.5 (build 882).
- The provided example shows how the `/etc/passwd` file is retrieved.
- The issue was discovered on 2013-06-06 and the patch was released on 2014-06-10.
- The vulnerability exists in multiple parts of the application and not just the example use case provided.
