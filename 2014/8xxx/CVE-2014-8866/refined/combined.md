How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2014-8866 / XSA-111
                              version 4

   Excessive checking in compatibility mode hypercall argument translation

UPDATES IN VERSION 4
====================

Fix patch name.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

The hypercall argument translation needed for 32-bit guests running on
64-bit hypervisors performs checks on the final register state.  These
checks cover all registers potentially holding hypercall arguments,
not just the ones actually doing so for the hypercall being processed,
since the code was originally intended for use only by PV guests.

While this is not a problem for PV guests (as they can't enter 64-bit
mode and hence can't alter the high halves of any of the registers),
the subsequent reuse of the same functionality for HVM guests exposed
those checks to values (specifically, unexpected values for the high
halves of registers not holding hypercall arguments) controlled by
guest software.

IMPACT
======

A buggy or malicious HVM guest can crash the host.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Xen 3.3 and onward are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only PV guests will avoid this issue.

There is no mitigation available for HVM guests on any version of Xen
so far released by xenproject.org.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201504-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, the worst of which
can allow remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.4.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.4.2-r1**revision >= **4.2.5-r8** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could possibly cause a Denial of Service condition or
obtain sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Xen 4.4 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.4.2-r1"

```

All Xen 4.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.5-r8"

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8594 CVE-2014-8595 CVE-2014-8866 CVE-2014-8867
                 CVE-2014-9030

Multiple security issues have been discovered in the Xen virtualisation
solution which may result in denial of service, information disclosure
or privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-8594

    Roger Pau Monne and Jan Beulich discovered that incomplete
    restrictions on MMU update hypercalls may result in privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2014-8595

    Jan Beulich discovered that missing privilege level checks in the
    x86 emulation of far branches may result in privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-8866

    Jan Beulich discovered that an error in compatibility mode hypercall
    argument translation may result in denial of service.

CVE-2014-8867

    Jan Beulich discovered that an insufficient restriction in
    acceleration support for the "REP MOVS" instruction may result in
    denial of service.

CVE-2014-9030

    Andrew Cooper discovered a page reference leak in MMU_MACHPHYS_UPDATE
    handling, resulting in denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-3+deb7u4.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.4.1-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.
