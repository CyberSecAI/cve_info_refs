See [CVE-2014-9636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9636) / [bug 1184985](show_bug.cgi?id=1184985 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9636 unzip: out-of-bounds read/write in test_compr_eb() in extract.c") to address issues identified by the oCERT-2014-011 test case.  The problem the patch in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c2) addresses is an uncompressed data size of 0 specified in certain extra field blocks (such as EF_NTSD mentioned in the report, but other types were affected as well).  If a zip file indicated that uncompressed data size was 0, unzip skipped the check to ensure that there were still enough data in the current extra field block to hold compression data header.  When using STORE compression (i.e. data stored uncompressed), this led to integer underflow, resulting in memcpy() getting called with excessively large size argument, causing it to over-read and over-write input and output buffers and crash.  This is unlikely to allow code execution.  Affected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-10 13:37:08 UTC  ```  Created unzip tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1191118](show_bug.cgi?id=1191118 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8139 CVE-2014-8141 CVE-2014-8140 unzip: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c8)  Fedora Update System    2015-02-16 03:25:45 UTC  ``` unzip-6.0-20.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

**oCERT-2014-011 UnZip input sanitization errors**

**Description**:

The [UnZip](http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html) tool is an
open source extraction utility for archives compressed in the zip format.

The unzip command line tool is affected by heap-based buffer overflows
within the CRC32 verification, the test\_compr\_eb() and the getZip64Data()
functions. The input errors may result in arbitrary code execution.

A specially crafted zip file, passed to unzip -t, can be used to trigger
the vulnerability.

**Affected version**:

[UnZip](http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html) <= 6.0

**Fixed version**:

[UnZip](http://www.info-zip.org/UnZip.html), N/A

**Credit**: vulnerability report from Michele Spagnuolo of Google Security Team

## Topic

Updated unzip packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The unzip utility is used to list, test, or extract files from a
zip archive.

A buffer overflow was found in the way unzip uncompressed certain extra
fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive could cause unzip to
crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code when the archive was tested with
unzip's '-t' option. (CVE-2014-9636)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way unzip computed the CRC32
checksum of certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted Zip archive
could cause unzip to crash when the archive was tested with unzip's '-t'
option. (CVE-2014-8139)

An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the
way unzip uncompressed certain extra fields of a file. A specially crafted
Zip archive could cause unzip to crash when the archive was tested with
unzip's '-t' option. (CVE-2014-8140)

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way unzip handled Zip64 files.
A specially crafted Zip archive could possibly cause unzip to crash when
the archive was uncompressed. (CVE-2014-8141)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-8139,
CVE-2014-8140, and CVE-2014-8141 issues. oCERT acknowledges Michele
Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team as the original reporter of
these issues.

All unzip users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-16 15:35:58 UTC  ``` oCERT reports an unzip flaw discovered by Michele Spagnuolo, Google Security Team:  """ The write error shows a problem in extract.c:test_compr_eb(), which was not expecting an uncompressed size of zero for an EF_NTSD extra block.  Proposed changes:  <http://antinode.info/ftp/info-zip/unzip60/extract.c>  extract.c:test_compr_eb() gets a new validity test. """  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-16 15:42:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 969621](attachment.cgi?id=969621&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=969621&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  This seems to be the upstream fix mentioned in the [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c0).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-22 15:49:05 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-011.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-10 12:36:54 UTC  ``` Upstream patch in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c2) does not address all related problems completely.  See [CVE-2014-9636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9636) / [bug 1184985](show_bug.cgi?id=1184985 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9636 unzip: out-of-bounds read/write in test_compr_eb() in extract.c") to address issues identified by the oCERT-2014-011 test case.  The problem the patch in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c2) addresses is an uncompressed data size of 0 specified in certain extra field blocks (such as EF_NTSD mentioned in the report, but other types were affected as well).  If a zip file indicated that uncompressed data size was 0, unzip skipped the check to ensure that there were still enough data in the current extra field block to hold compression data header.  When using STORE compression (i.e. data stored uncompressed), this led to integer underflow, resulting in memcpy() getting called with excessively large size argument, causing it to over-read and over-write input and output buffers and crash.  This is unlikely to allow code execution.  Affected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-10 13:37:08 UTC  ```  Created unzip tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1191118](show_bug.cgi?id=1191118 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8139 CVE-2014-8141 CVE-2014-8140 unzip: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c8)  Fedora Update System    2015-02-16 03:25:45 UTC  ``` unzip-6.0-20.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-16 15:24:35 UTC  ``` oCERT reports unzip flaw discovered by Michele Spagnuolo, Google Security Team.  """ I would like to report a heap overflow condition in the CRC32 verification of unzip, which may result in arbitrary code execution.  It can be triggered by passing a maliciously crafted zip files to unzip -t (version 6.00, both InfoZip and Debian).  Patches:  The problem was an unrealistic/invalid value in a .ZIP Extra Field.  There was a check (in extract.c:TestExtraField()) for an extra-block length that was too large, but no check for a too-small value.  In this example, the length (ebLen) was 1, and when "(ebLen-4)" was passed to crc32(), bad things happened.  A revised extract.c (which adds a new check and error message) should be available here:        <http://antinode.info/ftp/unzip60/extract.c> """  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-16 15:26:48 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 969598](attachment.cgi?id=969598&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=969598&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  Upstream fix, as described in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c0).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c4)  Petr Stodulka    2014-12-22 12:06:21 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 971984](attachment.cgi?id=971984&action=diff "patch for fedora") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=971984&action=edit "patch for fedora") patch for fedora  Original patch has wrong metadadata - '--- extract.c;-1'. Corrected file with and added paths suitable for our package on Fedora/RHEL.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-22 15:50:23 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-011.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c6)  Andrew Gallagher    2015-01-16 05:51:52 UTC  ``` Sorry if I'm mistaken, but I think this patch is causing "unzip -t" to now fail on executable JARs, which added the additional executable-jar extra field (<http://stackoverflow.com/tags/executable-jar/info>).  With this patch, extra fields that list a length of zero fail:  $ touch foo $ jar cvf foo.jar foo $ unzip -t foo.jar Archive:  foo.jar     testing: META-INF/               bad extra-field entry:       EF block length (0 bytes) invalid (< 4)     testing: META-INF/MANIFEST.MF     OK     testing: foo                      OK At least one error was detected in foo.jar.  Looking at the patch, it seems wrong since I *think* the spec allows this (but I wasn't sure of this).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-09 19:45:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrew Gallagher from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c6)) > Sorry if I'm mistaken, but I think this patch is causing "unzip -t" to now > fail on executable JARs, which added the additional executable-jar extra > field (<http://stackoverflow.com/tags/executable-jar/info>).  Upstream report of the issue is:  <http://www.info-zip.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=454>  Upstream acknowledged that the patch was incorrect and changed it to only perform the underflow check for the affected extra field type.  I will attach updated patch version, based on the extract.c version linked from the upstream forum.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-09 19:46:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 989833](attachment.cgi?id=989833&action=diff "Corrected upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=989833&action=edit "Corrected upstream patch") Corrected upstream patch   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-09 20:01:12 UTC  ``` The original report suggests code execution impact, but that does not seem to be correct.  As reported, there is and integer underflow triggered by extra field of type EF_PKVMS and with length value less than 4 (i.e. 0-3).  This leads to crc32() function called with length argument close to 2^32 (regardless of the system architecture), and leads to buffer over-read.  This over-read is long - it will trigger crash on 32bit systems, and is likely to trigger crash on 64bit systems as well.  As values read from the buffer are used to compute CRC value and are not copied to some other buffer, this does not corrupt memory, and hence does not have code execution impact.  Affected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-10 13:36:55 UTC  ```  Created unzip tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1191118](show_bug.cgi?id=1191118 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8139 CVE-2014-8141 CVE-2014-8140 unzip: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844#c13)  Petr Stodulka    2015-02-10 15:51:28 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 990132](attachment.cgi?id=990132&action=diff "last corrected upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=990132&action=edit "last corrected upstream patch") last corrected upstream patch  This is upstream patch which is part of last devel version.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-16 15:46:35 UTC  ``` oCERT reports an unzip flaw discovered by Michele Spagnuolo, Google Security Team:  """ The read errors show problems in process.c:getZip64Data(), which lacked any error detection or reporting, and was trying to extract multi-byte data from a buffer which did not contain enough bytes.  Proposed changes:  <http://antinode.info/ftp/info-zip/unzip60/fileio.c> fileio.c:do_string() looks at the status value returned from process.c:getZip64Data(), and puts out a new warning.      <http://antinode.info/ftp/info-zip/unzip60/process.c> process.c:getZip64Data() gets new validity tests, and it returns a useful status value. """  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-16 15:57:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 969625](attachment.cgi?id=969625&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=969625&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  Created using the instructions from the original report as quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c0).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c6)  Huzaifa S.

Older versions, such as unzip 5.52 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, do not contain affected code.  This is a heap-base buffer over-read issue.  Over-read is limited to 28 bytes, hence it's unlikely to lead to crash for normal builds.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c11)  Petr Stodulka    2015-02-10 09:28:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 990005](attachment.cgi?id=990005&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=990005&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch  This is upstream patch which is part of last devel version.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

See [CVE-2014-9636](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-9636) / [bug 1184985](show_bug.cgi?id=1184985 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-9636 unzip: out-of-bounds read/write in test_compr_eb() in extract.c") to address issues identified by the oCERT-2014-011 test case.  The problem the patch in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c2) addresses is an uncompressed data size of 0 specified in certain extra field blocks (such as EF_NTSD mentioned in the report, but other types were affected as well).  If a zip file indicated that uncompressed data size was 0, unzip skipped the check to ensure that there were still enough data in the current extra field block to hold compression data header.  When using STORE compression (i.e. data stored uncompressed), this led to integer underflow, resulting in memcpy() getting called with excessively large size argument, causing it to over-read and over-write input and output buffers and crash.  This is unlikely to allow code execution.  Affected code is only reached when running unzip in the test mode (unzip -t), but not when extracting zip archives.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-10 13:37:08 UTC  ```  Created unzip tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1191118](show_bug.cgi?id=1191118 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8139 CVE-2014-8141 CVE-2014-8140 unzip: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1174851#c8)  Fedora Update System    2015-02-16 03:25:45 UTC  ``` unzip-6.0-20.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.

Proposed changes:  <http://antinode.info/ftp/info-zip/unzip60/fileio.c> fileio.c:do_string() looks at the status value returned from process.c:getZip64Data(), and puts out a new warning.      <http://antinode.info/ftp/info-zip/unzip60/process.c> process.c:getZip64Data() gets new validity tests, and it returns a useful status value. """  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-16 15:57:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 969625](attachment.cgi?id=969625&action=diff "Upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=969625&action=edit "Upstream patch") Upstream patch  Created using the instructions from the original report as quoted in [comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c0).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-12-22 15:49:59 UTC  ``` External Reference:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-011.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-09 20:20:45 UTC  ``` This issue only affects UnZip version 6.0, which is the version that introduced Zip64 support.  Older versions, such as unzip 5.52 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, do not contain affected code.  This is a heap-base buffer over-read issue.  Over-read is limited to 28 bytes, hence it's unlikely to lead to crash for normal builds.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c11)  Petr Stodulka    2015-02-10 09:28:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 990005](attachment.cgi?id=990005&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=990005&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch  This is upstream patch which is part of last devel version. There are aesthetic (more readable) changes.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-10 13:20:26 UTC  ``` This issue can be triggered in both test (unzip -t) and extraction mode.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2015-02-10 13:37:23 UTC  ```  Created unzip tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1191118](show_bug.cgi?id=1191118 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8139 CVE-2014-8141 CVE-2014-8140 unzip: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c14)  Petr Stodulka    2015-02-10 15:47:28 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 990005](attachment.cgi?id=990005&action=diff "upstream patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=990005&action=edit "upstream patch") upstream patch  I apologize, that was for  [bug #1174844](show_bug.cgi?id=1174844 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-8139 unzip: CRC32 verification heap-based buffer overread (oCERT-2014-011)").   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1174856#c15)  Fedora Update System    2015-02-16 03:25:48 UTC  ``` unzip-6.0-20.fc21 has been pushed to the Fedora 21 stable repository.
