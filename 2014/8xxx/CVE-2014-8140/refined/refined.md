  "cveId": "CVE-2014-8140",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "Integer underflow when handling certain extra fields with an uncompressed size of zero.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Underflow",
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted Zip archive could cause unzip to crash when tested with the '-t' option due to buffer overflow during memcpy.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Specially crafted ZIP archive"
     ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs to craft a zip archive with specific extra field blocks with uncompressed data size set to 0.",
    "details": "The `test_compr_eb()` function in `extract.c` did not properly validate the uncompressed size of extra fields. When an uncompressed size of 0 was specified in a certain extra field block (like EF_NTSD), the check to ensure sufficient space for the compression data header was skipped. For `STORE` compression (uncompressed data), this leads to an integer underflow and `memcpy()` being called with a very large size, which causes an over-read and over-write of input and output buffers, causing a crash.",
      "affectedFunction": "extract.c:test_compr_eb()"
