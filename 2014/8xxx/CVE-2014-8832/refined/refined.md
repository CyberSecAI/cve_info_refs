- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue in Spotlight where memory contents may have been written to external hard drives when indexing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory management leading to information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unexpected information, potentially sensitive, could be written to external hard drives.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered during the Spotlight indexing process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a connected external hard drive while the system is indexing data. This doesn't require special privileges.
