Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8949:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The iMember360 WordPress plugin versions 3.8.012 through 3.9.001 contain multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and lack of proper permission checks on various $_GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Disclosure of database credentials:**  The `i4w_dbinfo` parameter, when set in the URL, would disclose the full database credentials (name, user, password, encoding). In versions before 3.9.001 this was accessible to anyone.  After, it requires a user to request an admin URL.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `decrypt` and `encrypt` parameters would directly print any provided XSS code into the page without sanitization, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
*   **Arbitrary user deletion:** The combination of `i4w_clearuser` (matching the API key or a null value if not activated) and `Email` parameters would delete the specified user from the WordPress database.
*  **Arbitrary code execution:** The `i4w_trace` parameter allows unescaped values to be passed to the system shell if the request is made by an authenticated admin user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database credential disclosure:** Attackers could gain full access to the database, potentially compromising all stored data, including user information and sensitive site configurations.
*   **XSS Vulnerabilities:** Attackers could inject malicious scripts into the website, leading to phishing, session hijacking, and other client-side attacks.  In some instances, due to caching it may be possible to achieve persistent XSS.
*   **Arbitrary user deletion:** Attackers could remove any user from the system, including administrators, potentially disrupting site operations and preventing legitimate users from accessing the site.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server by convincing an admin to visit a malicious link, leading to complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:**  Attackers exploit vulnerable parameters via crafted URL requests using HTTP GET method.
*   **Phishing:**  Attackers could use the XSS and code execution vulnerabilities to create phishing attacks, tricking users into clicking malicious links.
*   **Dictionary Based Scanning:**  Attackers can discover the vulnerable parameters through dictionary-based URL scanning.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and URL manipulation**
*   **For database disclosure:** In versions prior to 3.9.001, no authentication was required. After, a registered user account was needed.
*   **For arbitrary user deletion:** The attacker needs to know or guess the target username (often printed in HTML comments) and either the API key or that the API has not been activated.
*   **For arbitrary code execution:** The attacker needs to convince an admin to click on a crafted link with the `i4w_trace` parameter and they have to be an authenticated admin.
