##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# What Is a DDoS Attack?

[Home](https://sensorstechforum.com/) > What Is a DDoS Attack?

## What Is a DDoS Attack?

### DDoS Short Definition:

DDoS stands for Distributed Denial-of-Service. It is a type of attack in which the threat actor aims to make a machine or a network unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of the host.

### Distributed Denial of Service: Extended Definition

Denial of service (DoS) can be accomplished by flooding the target with excessive requests. The purpose of this attack is to overload the targeted system and prevent its legitimate requests from being fulfilled.

A Distributed Denial-of-Service attack, shortly known as a DDoS attack, is when the incoming traffic flooding the target comes from multiple sources. In terms of its mitigation,this type of attack requires more sophisticated strategies, because attempting to block a single source of the attack is unsatisfactory.

![ddos-definition-sensorstechforum-cyber-dictionary](https://cdn.sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ddos-definition-sensorstechforum-cyber-dictionary-1024x585.jpg)

DDoS attacks of criminal intent often target sites or services hosted on high-profile web servers. These often include financial institutions and payment gateways. The reasons for such an attack may be blackmail or activism.

DDoS attacks can be quite effective, as they may utilize multiple compromised computer systems as sources of the attack traffix. Exploited machines could be computers and IoT devices. These attacks can be described as an unexpected traffic jam that clogs up the traffic highway, preventing regular traffic from reaching its final destination.

The Akamai Security Intelligence Response Team (SIRT) recently reported the discovery of a newly developed Go-based botnet, named “HinataBot” by researchers. This botnet is focused on [Distributed Denial of Service](https://sensorstechforum.com/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) (DDoS) attacks and appears to have been named after a character from the popular anime series, Naruto, by the malware author.

## CVE-2014-8361, CVE-2017-17215 Used in DDoS Attacks

![ddos attack](https://cdn.sensorstechforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CVE-2017-17215-sensorstechforum-com-300x171.jpeg)

It is noteworthy that the Huawei vulnerability, in particular, was used to built a botnet by a malware author known as Anarchy in 2018 that [compromised more than 18,000 routers in a single day](https://sensorstechforum.com/botnet-built-using-cve-2017-17215/). According to security researchers, Anarchy may be the same hacker who previously used the Wicked nickname and who is behind some of Mirai’s variations (Wicked, Omni, and Owari).

## A Look Into HinataBot

HinataBot, which essentially is a Go-based malware, was uncovered within HTTP and SSH honeypots. The malware is noteworthy due to its large size and the lack of specific identification around its newer hashes. The file name structures of the malware binaries were named after a character from the popular anime series, Naruto, such as “Hinata-–“, Akamai [said](https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/hinatabot-uncovering-new-golang-ddos-botnet).

Due to its high performance, ease of multi-threading, and its ability to be cross-compiled for multiple architectures and operating systems, the prevalence of Go-based threats such as HinataBot, GoBruteForcer, and kmsdbot is increasing. Attackers may choose Go for its complexity when compiled, making it more challenging to reverse engineer the final binaries.

HinataBot has been designed to communicate via multiple methods, such as initiating and accepting incoming connections. In the past, it has been observed to conduct DDoS flooding attacks using protocols like HTTP, UDP, TCP, and ICMP. However, the latest version of HinataBot has limited its attack methods to only HTTP and UDP.

The emergence of HinataBot is a testament to the ever-shifting threat landscape, particularly with respect to botnets. Cybercriminals are consistently coming up with new ways to deploy malicious code, such as coding in different languages and leveraging different distribution networks. By borrowing from established tactics, like those employed by the infamous [Mirai](https://sensorstechforum.com/new-mirai-botnet-emerges/), attackers can focus on creating malware that is difficult to detect and capable of evolving over time while incorporating new features, the Akamai team concluded.

# Advisory Details

April 24th, 2015
## (0Day) Realtek SDK miniigd AddPortMapping SOAP Action Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-15-155ZDI-CAN-2435

| CVE ID | [CVE-2014-8361](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-8361) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Realtek](http://www.realtek.com.tw/contact/%20) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [rtl81xx SDK](http://152.104.125.41/products/productsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=9&PFid=12&Level=4&Conn=3) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['19225']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of the Realtek SDK. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the miniigd SOAP service. The issue lies in the handling of the NewInternalClient requests due to a failure to sanitize user data before executing a system call. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code with root privileges. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI vulnerability disclosure policy on lack of vendor response.  Vendor Contact Timeline:  08/13/2014 - ZDI wrote to vendor requesting contact and PGP09/04/2014 - ZDI wrote to vendor requesting contact and PGP09/29/2014 - ZDI wrote to vendor requesting contact and PGP10/22/2014 - ZDI wrote to vendor requesting contact and PGP, indicated "final" email attempt and informed of intent to 0-day04/24/2015 - Public release of advisory  -- Mitigation:  Given the stated purpose of Realtek SDK, and the nature of the vulnerability, the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with the service to trusted machines. Only the clients and servers that have a legitimate procedural relationship with products using Realtek SDK service should be permitted to communicate with it. This could be accomplished in a number of ways, most notably with firewall rules/whitelisting. These features are available in the native Windows Firewall, as described in <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725770%28WS.10%29.aspx> and numerous other Microsoft Knowledge Base articles. |
