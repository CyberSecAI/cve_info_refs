- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A bounds checking issue existed in a user client vended by the IOHIDFamily driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient bounds checking, allowing a malicious application to overwrite arbitrary portions of the kernel address space.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution within the kernel.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user with the ability to execute a malicious application.
