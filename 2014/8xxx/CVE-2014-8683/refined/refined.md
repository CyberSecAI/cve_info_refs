{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Gogs (Go Git Service) markdown renderer does not properly sanitize HTML input, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could be used in social engineering attacks to gain access to restricted resources by extracting authentication tokens from cookies, or by executing commands in the context of the logged in victim.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A crafted markdown input is sent to the /api/v1/markdown or /api/v1/markdown/raw endpoints.",
        "The response renders unsanitized HTML which will execute Javascript when viewed."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send a crafted markdown text to the Gogs API. No authentication is required.  Social engineering may be required to get a user to view the crafted markdown output."
