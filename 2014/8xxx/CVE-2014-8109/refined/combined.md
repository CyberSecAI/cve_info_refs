# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2016

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 248 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

**Please note that on November 10, 2015, Oracle released [Security Alert for CVE-2015-4852](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2015-4852.html). Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-4852.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2016 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2074802.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2074802.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 78 new security fixes for the Oracle E-Business Suite. 69 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#EBS).

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security fixes are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2016 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Releases 11i and 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (January 2016), [My Oracle Support Note 2072202.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2072202.1)

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 8 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2016verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1174077#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-12-15 05:11:33 UTC  ``` If an authorization script for LuaAuthzProvider were provided in the configuration multiple times, only the arguments of the last specification were used when invoking the script. This could lead to scripts being invoked with unexpected arguments.  Further details are available in the thread of the original report and bug:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/28/5>  <https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57204>  Upstream fix:  <https://github.com/apache/httpd/commit/3f1693d558d0758f829c8b53993f1749ddf6ffcb>  This affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.3 and later (such as what is shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7), as mod_lua is not available in earlier releases.

## Updated apache packages fix CVE-2014-8109

Publication date: 07 Jan 2015

Modification date: 07 Jan 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-8109](CVE-2014-8109.html)

## Description

```
Updated apache packages fix security vulnerability:

mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.10 does
not support an httpd configuration in which the same Lua authorization
provider is used with different arguments within different contexts, which
allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in
opportunistic circumstances by leveraging multiple Require directives, as
demonstrated by a configuration that specifies authorization for one group to
access a certain directory, and authorization for a second group to access a
second directory (CVE-2014-8109).

```

Subject: CVE Request: "LuaAuthzProvider" in Apache HTTP Server mixes up arguments

<https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57204>

LuaAuthzProvider in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.3 and later allows users to
supply their own Lua scripts to perform authorization.  If the same
script is specified in httpd.conf  multiple times, with different
(free-form) arguments, only the last specified argument is used for
all invocations of the script.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14916#c0)  David Walser    2014-12-30 17:56:17 CET  ``` OpenSuSE has issued an advisory on December 29: <http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2014-12/msg00108.html>  Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 4 and Cauldron.  Advisory: ========================  Updated apache packages fix security vulnerability:  mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.10 does not support an httpd configuration in which the same Lua authorization provider is used with different arguments within different contexts, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging multiple Require directives, as demonstrated by a configuration that specifies authorization for one group to access a certain directory, and authorization for a second group to access a second directory (CVE-2014-8109).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [apache2](/security/cves?package=apache2) - Apache HTTP server

## Details

Martin Holst Swende discovered that the mod\_headers module allowed HTTP

trailers to replace HTTP headers during request processing. A remote

attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass RequestHeaders directives.

([CVE-2013-5704](/security/CVE-2013-5704))

Mark Montague discovered that the mod\_cache module incorrectly handled

empty HTTP Content-Type headers. A remote attacker could use this issue to

cause the server to stop responding, leading to a denial of service. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2014-3581](/security/CVE-2014-3581))

Teguh P. Alko discovered that the mod\_proxy\_fcgi module incorrectly

handled long response headers. A remote attacker could use this issue to

cause the server to stop responding, leading to a denial of service. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2014-3583](/security/CVE-2014-3583))

It was discovered that the mod\_lua module incorrectly handled different

arguments within different contexts. A remote attacker could possibly use

this issue to bypass intended access restrictions. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2014-8109](/security/CVE-2014-8109))

Guido Vranken discovered that the mod\_lua module incorrectly handled a

specially crafted websocket PING in certain circumstances. A remote

attacker could possibly use this issue to cause the server to stop

responding, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2015-0228](/security/CVE-2015-0228))

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c0)  Eric Covener    2014-11-12 14:52:50 UTC  ``` as reported in comments section of the manual anonymously, it looks like the lua-specific hash used to store the parameters gets mixed up if you define 1 provider but use it with multiple require arguments.   original:  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_lua.html#comment_3245> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c1)  Gregory A Lundberg    2014-11-14 03:47:05 UTC  ``` Reactivated ancient apache bugzilla account to record as originator of comment on modlua documentation page. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c2)  Edward Lu    2014-11-19 21:26:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 32219](attachment.cgi?id=32219&action=diff "Allow multiple LuaAuthzProvider directives with the same provider name but different args") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=32219&action=edit "Allow multiple LuaAuthzProvider directives with the same provider name but different args") Allow multiple LuaAuthzProvider directives with the same provider name but different args ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c3)  Edward Lu    2014-11-19 21:29:10 UTC  ``` Forgot to attach comment to patch.  Above patch should fix the issue. The operative part is that it separates the provider from the arguments that are passed to it.  As a sidenote, the typenames lua_authz_provider_spec and lua_authz_provider_func should probably be switched. I skipped that in the interest of a smaller diff, but whoever reviews/commits should probably look at naming those better. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c4)  Eric Covener    2014-11-20 00:18:31 UTC  ``` Thanks, waiting to see if a CVE should be assigned. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c5)  Eric Covener    2014-12-29 20:30:17 UTC  ``` CVE-2014-8109, waiting for next 2.4.x release ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=57204#c6)  Yann Ylavic    2015-01-23 08:49:44 UTC  ``` Backported to 2.4.11 in [r1642861](https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1642861). ``` |  |
