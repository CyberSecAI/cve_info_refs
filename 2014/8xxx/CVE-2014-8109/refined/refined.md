    "summary": "The vulnerability is in the mod_lua module of the Apache HTTP Server. When the same Lua authorization provider is used with different arguments within different contexts, only the arguments of the last specification are used. This could allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. Patches were made to fix the issue.",
