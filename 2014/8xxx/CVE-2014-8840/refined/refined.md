Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-8840:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how the iTunes Store handles URLs redirected from Safari. Specifically, there's an implicit trust of sites that offer URL redirection services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure URL Handling:** The iTunes Store does not properly validate URLs redirected from Safari. It trusts redirection services implicitly, which is a vulnerability.
- **Sandbox Bypass:** A flaw exists that allows malicious websites to bypass the sandbox restrictions imposed by Safari.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sandbox Bypass:** Attackers can escape the security sandbox of the Safari browser.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This can lead to an attacker executing code outside of the sandbox and potentially escalating privileges on the vulnerable system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:**  The primary attack vector is a malicious website or page.
- **URL Redirection:** Attackers leverage URL redirection services to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to host a malicious web page or control a website that performs URL redirections.
- **User Interaction:** The victim has to be lured into visiting a malicious page or clicking on a malicious link that redirects to the iTunes store.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by lokihardt@ASRT, working with HP's Zero Day Initiative.
- Apple addressed this vulnerability in iOS 8.1.3 by "improved filtering of URLs opened by the iTunes Store."
- The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) assigned the ID ZDI-15-010 to the vulnerability.
