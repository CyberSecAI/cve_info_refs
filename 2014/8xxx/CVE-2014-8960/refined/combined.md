| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=906486#c0)  Andreas Stieger   2014-11-20 21:23:38 UTC  ``` <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2014-14.php>  Announcement-ID: PMASA-2014-14  Date: 2014-11-20 Summary: Local file inclusion vulnerability.  In the GIS editor feature, a parameter specifying the geometry type was not correcly validated, opening the door to a local file inclusion attack. Severity  We consider this vulnerability to be serious. Mitigation factor  This vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who is logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required page. Affected Versions  Versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.6), 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.7) and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.12) are affected. Solution  Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.6 or newer, or 4.1.14.7 or newer, or 4.2.12 or newer, or apply the patch listed below. References  Thanks to Johannes Dahse (<https://twitter.com/FluxReiners>) for reporting this vulnerability.

Description      With a crafted database, table or column name it is possible to trigger an XSS attack in the table browse page.     With a crafted ENUM value it is possible to trigger XSS attacks in the table print view and zoom search pages.     With a crafted value for font size it is possible to trigger an XSS attack in the home page.  Severity  We consider this vulnerabilities to be non critical. Mitigation factor  These vulnerabilities can be triggered only by someone who is logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required pages. Moreover, exploitation of the XSS vulnerability related to the font size requires forgery of the pma_fontsize cookie.

## PMASA-2014-15

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2014-15

**Date:** 2014-11-20

### Summary

XSS vulnerability in error reporting functionality.

### Description

With a crafted file name it is possible to trigger an XSS in the error reporting page.

### Severity

We consider this vulnerability to be non critical.

### Mitigation factor

This vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who is logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required page.

### Affected Versions

Versions 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.7) and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.12) are affected.

### Solution

Upgrade to 4.1.14.7 or newer, or 4.2.12 or newer, or apply the patch listed below.

### References

Thanks to Johannes Dahse (<https://twitter.com/FluxReiners>) for reporting this vulnerability.
