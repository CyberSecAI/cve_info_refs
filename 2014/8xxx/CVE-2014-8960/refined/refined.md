Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of a crafted file name within the error reporting functionality of phpMyAdmin. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is an XSS vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into the error reporting page due to the lack of sanitization of the filename.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session. This could lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user
    - Defacing the application
- The severity is considered "non-critical" by phpMyAdmin team, likely because it requires a logged-in user to trigger, but impact could still be significant.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the error reporting functionality within phpMyAdmin.
- A crafted file name is used to inject malicious javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be logged in to phpMyAdmin to exploit this vulnerability due to token protection.
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious filename to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in phpMyAdmin versions 4.1.x before 4.1.14.7 and 4.2.x before 4.2.12.
- Patches were released to address this vulnerability, specifically commit `9364e2eee5681681caf7205c0933bc18af11e233` (and related commits for the 4.1 branch).
- The vulnerability was reported by Johannes Dahse.
- The vulnerability is also assigned CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting) and CWE-661 (Improper handling of file names).
