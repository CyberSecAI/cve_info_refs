{
  "CVE-2014-8102": {
    "Description": "The XFixes extension in X.Org X Server does not validate the length in SProcXFixesSelectSelectionInput, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper validation of the length field provided by the client in the `SProcXFixesSelectSelectionInput` function within the XFixes extension.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service condition or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious X client that sends a specially crafted request with an invalid length field to the X server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the X server and send X protocol requests. The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with the X server. The XFixes extension needs to be enabled."
