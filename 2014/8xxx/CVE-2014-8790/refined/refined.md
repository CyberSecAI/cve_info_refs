Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the insecure use of the `simplexml_load_string()` function in the `admin/api.php` script of GetSimple CMS. This function parses XML data without proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an XXE injection. The application does not disable external entity loading when parsing XML, making it susceptible to this attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosures:** An attacker can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server.
*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Sensitive data stored in XML files can be exposed, potentially including data that could lead to bypassing authentication mechanisms.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the ability to disclose sensitive data, including configuration files, the attacker could potentially gain administrative access and execute arbitrary PHP code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `data` POST parameter to the `admin/api.php` script.
*   The attacker sends malicious XML data containing an external entity definition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable `api.php` script.
*   The External API must be enabled in the `gsconfig.php` file.
*   The application must be running on a PHP version prior to 5.3.23 or 5.4.13.
