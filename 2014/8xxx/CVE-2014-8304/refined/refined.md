      "source": "websecurity.com.ua_a3c3386e_20250124_222824.html",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing the 'next_template' parameter in the admin/index.php page.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Brute Force"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. An attacker can also perform a brute-force attack on the admin login page.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By injecting malicious script into the 'next_template' parameter of the vulnerable URL.",

      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it, or make repeated login attempts to brute force admin credentials.",
       "details": "The XSS vulnerability is present in the 'next_template' parameter of the admin/index.php page. The provided exploit demonstrates an alert of the document.cookie. A brute force vulnerability is also present in the same page, which allows an attacker to try multiple login attempts to gain access to the admin page."

        "root_cause": "In-Portal CMS fails to sanitize user-supplied input when processing the 'next_template' parameter and is also vulnerable to brute force attacks.",

        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Brute Force"

       "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser session and obtain sensitive information or perform malicious actions. An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the admin panel.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By injecting malicious script into the 'next_template' parameter of the vulnerable URL.",

       "details": "The XSS vulnerability is present in the 'next_template' parameter of the admin/index.php page, which can be exploited using a crafted URL containing a malicious script. The system is also vulnerable to brute force attacks on the admin login page. The vendor recommended limiting access by IP address as a workaround for the brute force issue, but didn't fix the actual flaw."
