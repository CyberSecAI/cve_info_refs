or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-8137](/security/CVE-2014-8137))

Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly decoded certain malformed

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash

or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-8138](/security/CVE-2014-8138))

It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1713)

## Topic

Updated rhev-hypervisor packages that fix multiple security issues, several
bugs, and add various enhancements are now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG
2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application using
JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138)

A race condition flaw, leading to a heap-based memory corruption, was found
in spice's worker\_update\_monitors\_config() function, which runs under the
QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could leverage this flaw to
crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process. (CVE-2015-3247)

A double free flaw was found in the way JasPer parsed ICC color profiles in
JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application
using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8137)

It was found that the idle timeout in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Manager Web Admin interface failed to log out a session if a VM has been
selected in the VM grid view. This could allow a local attacker to access
the web interface if it was left unattended. (CVE-2015-1841)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137 and
CVE-2014-8138. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as
the original reporter. The CVE-2015-3247 issue was discovered by Frediano
Ziglio of Red Hat. The CVE-2015-1841 issue was discovered by Einav Cohen
of Red Hat.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, installing the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7

RPM on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 host failed, because no such thing was
available. Now, the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7 RPM is
available in the rhel-6-server-rhevh-rpms channel, and can be installed on
a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 host. (BZ#1193678)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* With this release, the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualizaton Hypervisor now

includes the drivers for the Dell Shared PERC8 RAID Controller.
(BZ#1186582)

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Version ovirt-node-recipe-3.2.3-14.el7.noarch.rpm ovirt-node-3.2.3-14.el7.noarch rhev-hypervisor7-7.1-20150728.1  # cat /etc/system-release-cpe  cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7:update1:hypervisor  # hostnamectl     Static hostname: n/a Transient hostname: localhost          Icon name: computer-desktop            Chassis: desktop         Machine ID: 8d74f21f449f4457b46a1c83625858af            Boot ID: ad6c444cf2064807b3c7a2cd8c47087e   Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1        CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.1:GA:client             Kernel: Linux 3.10.0-229.7.2.el7.x86_64       Architecture: x86_64  # cat /etc/os-release  NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Client" VERSION="7.1 (Maipo)" ID="rhel" ID_LIKE="fedora" VERSION_ID="7.1" PRETTY_NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1" ANSI_COLOR="0;31" CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.1:GA:client" HOME_URL="<https://www.redhat.com/>" BUG_REPORT_URL="<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/>"  REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1" REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=7.1 REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="7.1"   Expected result: Use RHEVH itself values instead of RHEL values.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c2)  Ying Cui    2015-08-05 09:21:49 UTC  ``` Tested on build rhev-hypervisor-7-7.1-20150804.0. After ticket in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c1) is resolved, now the NAME already set as "Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" not Client. But the CPE_NAME still display the RHEL info, NOT RHEV-H CPE, hostnamectl will return incorrect CPE name. And REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT value whether should be "Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor"?   # cat /etc/rhev-hypervisor-release  Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor release 7.1 (20150804.0.el7ev)   # cat /etc/system-release-cpe  cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7:update1:hypervisor  # hostnamectl     Static hostname: n/a Transient hostname: localhost          Icon name: computer-desktop            Chassis: desktop         Machine ID: 58cca1ceed28468fb4034bf84f7ed14d            Boot ID: e59d79a5bb824dbc9c85d0963fa35c72   Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1        CPE OS Name: cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.1:GA:server             Kernel: Linux 3.10.0-229.11.1.el7.x86_64       Architecture: x86_64  # cat /etc/os-release  NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" VERSION="7.1 (Maipo)" ID="rhel" ID_LIKE="fedora" VERSION_ID="7.1" PRETTY_NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1" ANSI_COLOR="0;31" CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.1:GA:server" HOME_URL="<https://www.redhat.com/>" BUG_REPORT_URL="<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/>"  REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1" REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=7.1 REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="7.1"   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c3)  Fabian Deutsch    2015-08-05 10:01:00 UTC  ``` The CPE fix requires another patch, because the CPE string is now stored twice.  Please verify this bug (as the right package is now used), and file a separate bug for the incorrect CPE string in /etc/os-release.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c5)  Ying Cui    2015-08-10 07:39:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Fabian Deutsch from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c3)) > The CPE fix requires another patch, because the CPE string is now stored > twice. >  > Please verify this bug (as the right package is now used), and file a > separate bug for the incorrect CPE string in /etc/os-release.

Thanks.  NAME, VERSION, ID, ID_LIKE, REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT, REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT in /etc/os-release  Are all correct? Do we need to care these values in RHEV-H?  # cat /etc/os-release  NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server" VERSION="7.1 (Maipo)" ID="rhel" ID_LIKE="fedora" VERSION_ID="7.1" PRETTY_NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1" ANSI_COLOR="0;31" CPE_NAME="cpe:/o:redhat:enterprise_linux:7.1:GA:server" HOME_URL="<https://www.redhat.com/>" BUG_REPORT_URL="<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/>"  REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1" REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT_VERSION=7.1 REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Linux" REDHAT_SUPPORT_PRODUCT_VERSION="7.1"   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c7)  Fabian Deutsch    2015-08-10 11:03:06 UTC  ``` Yes, the relevant lines in os-reelase are updated:  REDHAT_BUGZILLA_PRODUCT="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1" PRETTY_NAME="Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor 7.1"   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c8)  Fabian Deutsch    2015-08-10 11:13:17 UTC  ``` To clarify: It's obvious that some entries in os-release are wrong (see [comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c6)), but we never updated those entries in the past, as they were irrelevant to RHEV-H. I opened [bug 1251936](show_bug.cgi?id=1251936 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Adjust all relevent fields in /etc/os-release and ensure they contain the correct informations") to make sure that - in future - we update all fields (to have a consistent behavior) and to make sure the fields contain the correct informations.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c9)  Ying Cui    2015-08-13 05:51:17 UTC  ``` For this bug, we only verify ticket 364388 in [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c1) fix, see [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c2).  For further issues fix, we will trace by [bug 1251936](show_bug.cgi?id=1251936 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Adjust all relevent fields in /etc/os-release and ensure they contain the correct informations") and [bug 1251864](show_bug.cgi?id=1251864 "CLOSED ERRATA - Incorrect CPE Name in /etc/os-release"). Thanks.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1248942#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-09-03 17:09:42 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1173162#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-11 15:02:27 UTC  ``` oCERT reports a heap-overflow issue in jp2_decode() in jasper:    This code in jas_decode doesn't check for an upper bound on the value of   channo:  	jas_image_setcmpttype(dec->image, 	  dec->chantocmptlut[dec->cdef->data.cdef.ents[i].channo], 	  jp2_getct(jas_image_clrspc(dec->image), 	  dec->cdef->data.cdef.ents[i].type, dec->cdef->data.cdef.ents[i].assoc));      This could be used via jas_image_setcmpttype (actually this is just   image->cmpts_[cmptno]->type_ = type), to do an arbitrary write since   there's no bound check there either.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1173162#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-11 15:17:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 967280](attachment.cgi?id=967280&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967280&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  This adds channo check directly to jp2_decode().  An alternative would be to do check earlier in jp2_cdef_getdata().  However, as jp2_decode() does other similar sanity checks, it seems more consistent to add the check there as well.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1173162#c3)  Jiri Popelka    2014-12-11 16:09:16 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 967280](attachment.cgi?id=967280&action=diff "Proposed patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=967280&action=edit "Proposed patch") Proposed patch  Patch looks good to me.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1173162#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-12-18 14:16:11 UTC  ``` Public now via oCERT-2014-012 advisory.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2483-1: JasPer vulnerabilities

26 January 2015

JasPer could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Details

Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled ICC color profiles in

JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially

crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash

or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-8137](/security/CVE-2014-8137))

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0698)

## Topic

Updated rhevm-spice-client packages that fix multiple security issues,
several bugs, and add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual
machines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client
and usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows
64-bit operating systems.

This update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value
(TLS\_FALLBACK\_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade
attacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS
protocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest
supported protocol version fails.

This can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.
The SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle
attack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.
This issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias
POODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future
update; it is recommended that users configure their applications to
require at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.

For additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article
at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123>

Multiple flaws were found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.
A specially crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash
or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157,
CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2014-8137, CVE-2011-4516, CVE-2011-4517,
CVE-2008-3520, CVE-2008-3522)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2014-8137,
CVE-2014-8138, CVE-2014-8157, CVE-2014-8158, CVE-2014-9029, CVE-2011-4516,
and CVE-2011-4517. oCERT acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security
Team as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8137 and CVE-2014-8138; and
pyddeh as the original reporter of CVE-2014-8157 and CVE-2014-8158.

The mingw-openssl and mingw-jasper packages have been upgraded to the
latest upstream version, which provides a number of bug fixes and
enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1187585)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, a guest system installed with tools incorrectly always

started in full screen mode, even when the "Open in Full Screen" option was
unchecked in console options. Now, when connecting in window mode with the
option unchecked, the guest system starts in a window as expected.
(BZ#1172126)

* Prior to this update, copying and pasting of images from the client to

the guest did not work when spice-gtk was built from upstream. Now, images
can be copied and pasted without problems. (BZ#1187270)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* Administrators now have the option of automatic multiuser installation of

virt-viewer onto many client workstations. (BZ#1187272)

All rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancement.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Package        : jasper
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8137 CVE-2014-8138
Debian Bug     : 773463

Jose Duart of the Google Security Team discovered a double free flaw
(CVE-2014-8137) and a heap-based buffer overflow flaw (CVE-2014-8138)
in JasPer, a library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files. A specially
crafted file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.900.1-13+deb7u2.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1179282#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-01-06 14:29:24 UTC  ``` oCERT reports an issue in jasper discovered by pyddeh:  """  jpc_dec.c:1204:      dec->numhtiles = JPC_CEILDIV(dec->xend - dec->tilexoff, dec->tilewidth);     dec->numvtiles = JPC_CEILDIV(dec->yend - dec->tileyoff, dec->tileheight);     dec->numtiles = dec->numhtiles * dec->numvtiles;     if (!(dec->tiles = jas_malloc(dec->numtiles * sizeof(jpc_dec_tile_t)))) {         return -1;     }  the dec->XXX in JPC_CEILDIV are all directly from the codestream, so dec->numtiles can be 0. In that case, the minimum-sized chunk returned by malloc can, depending on the code stream, be used later. I think this can cause the same problems as a use after free. Fix proposal:      if ( dec->numtiles == 0 || !(dec->tiles = jas_malloc(dec->numtiles * sizeof(jpc_dec_tile_t)))) {         return -1;     }  """  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT acknowledges pyddeh as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1179282#c1)  Jiri Popelka    2015-01-08 12:24:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vasyl Kaigorodov from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1179282#c0)) > Fix proposal: >  >     if ( dec->numtiles == 0 || !(dec->tiles = jas_malloc(dec->numtiles * > sizeof(jpc_dec_tile_t)))) { >         return -1; >     }  LGTM   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1179282#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2015-01-09 10:18:47 UTC  ``` While the patch looks harmless, it's unclear to me how it helps as the issue is not clearly identified in the report.  As far as I can see, all dec->tiles[] accesses user dec->numtiles as an upper bound, so there does not seem to be any issue with overflowing under-allocated buffer.  It's unclear where the reported user-after-free-like problem should happen.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1179282#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2015-01-09 21:00:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to Tomas Hoger from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1179282#c2)) > As far as I can see, all dec->tiles[] accesses user dec->numtiles as an upper > bound, so there does not seem to be any issue with overflowing under-allocated > buffer.  The check in jpc_dec_process_sot() is actually off-by-one:      if (JAS_CAST(int, sot->tileno) > dec->numtiles) {         jas_eprintf("invalid tile number in SOT marker segment\n");         return -1;     }     /* Set the current tile. */     dec->curtile = &dec->tiles[sot->tileno];     tile = dec->curtile;  sot->tileno equal to dec->numtiles already makes dec->tiles[] access outside of the allocated bounds.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1179282#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2015-01-22 08:36:33 UTC  ``` Public now via oCERT-2015-001.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A2021)

## Topic

Updated jasper packages that fix three security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

JasPer is an implementation of Part 1 of the JPEG 2000 image compression
standard.

Multiple off-by-one flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were
found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted
file could cause an application using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-9029)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG
2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application using
JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8138)

A double free flaw was found in the way JasPer parsed ICC color profiles in
JPEG 2000 image files. A specially crafted file could cause an application
using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-8137)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT
acknowledges Jose Duart of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter.

All JasPer users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All applications using
the JasPer libraries must be restarted for the update to take effect.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
