{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-8138",
  "description": "Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly decoded certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way JasPer decoded JPEG 2000 image files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow due to incorrect handling of malformed JPEG-2000 image files."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file.",
       "Tricking a user into opening the crafted file."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious JPEG 2000 image file and trick a user into opening it.",
        "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability lies in the `jp2_decode()` function of the JasPer library. This function does not properly check upper bounds when decoding JPEG2000 files. This lack of proper bounds checking can lead to an arbitrary write on the system."
