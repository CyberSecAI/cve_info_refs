Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2014-8706:

**CVE-2014-8706:** Multiple Full Path Disclosure in Pluck CMS 4.7.2

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to PHP errors that reveal the full server path. Specifically, improper handling of the `PHPSESSID` cookie and the `image` parameter in the `albums_getimage.php` file are the cause.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Full Path Disclosure:**  The application reveals the server's file system path in error messages. This occurs through multiple vectors, such as:
        *   Changing the `PHPSESSID` cookie to an array.
        *   Adding non-alphanumeric characters to the `PHPSESSID` cookie.
        *   Providing an array as the `image` parameter.
        *   Using a null byte injection in the `image` parameter.
    *   The application makes use of the PHP functions `strpos`, `preg_match` and `file_exists` in ways that are vulnerable to unexpected inputs.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information about the server's file structure, including the absolute path to the webroot and other sensitive files.
    *   This knowledge can help an attacker prepare more sophisticated attacks.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP Requests:**  The attack vectors involve sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the server, including manipulated cookies (`PHPSESSID`) and query parameters (`image`).
    *   Direct interaction with the login page and image retrieval component of the application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Pluck CMS instance.
    *   No special authentication or prior knowledge required other than being able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
