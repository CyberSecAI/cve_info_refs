  "CVE-2014-8483": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was discovered in the Quassel-core component of the distributed IRC client Quassel. The vulnerability is caused by a missing size check in the Blowfish ECB decryption function when processing encrypted messages. An attacker can send a crafted message that can cause the component to crash, leading to a denial of service or the disclosure of information from process memory.",
    "affected_components": [
      "quassel",
      "konversation",
      "libqt4"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The ECB Blowfish decryption function in Quassel and Konversation assumed that encrypted input would always be in blocks of 12 characters. When an attacker sends malformed messages with a different length, it leads to out-of-bounds read issues, crashes or information leaks.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Denial of Service",
      "Information Leak"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can crash the application, leading to a denial-of-service condition or potentially leak information from process memory due to the out-of-bounds read.",
    "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by receiving a specially crafted message, using the Blowfish ECB encryption, on an IRC channel where encryption is enabled.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send crafted messages to a vulnerable Quassel or Konversation client on an encrypted IRC channel."
