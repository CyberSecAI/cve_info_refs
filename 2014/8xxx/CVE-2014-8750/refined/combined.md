### Bug Description

When spawning some instances, nova VMware driver could have a race condition in VNC port allocation. Although the get\_vnc\_port function has a lock it not guarantee that the whole vnc port allocation process is locked, so another instance could receive the same port if it requests the VNC port before nova has finished the vnc port allocation to another VM.

If the instances with the same VNC port are allocated in same host it could lead to a improper access to the instance console.

Reproduce the problem: Launch two or more instances at same time. In some cases one instance could execute the get\_vnc\_port and pick a port but before this instance has finished the \_set\_vnc\_config another instance could execute get\_vnc\_port and pick the same port.

How often this occurs: unpredictable.

Could this behavior be controlled by a would-be attacker, or is it only up to random chance? If the former then like [bug 1058077](/bugs/1058077)/[bug 1125378](/bugs/1125378) the VMT would likely deem it a security vulnerability. If the latter like [bug 1255609](/bugs/1255609) we would most probably not.

Since it looks like something an attacker could probably leverage repetition to eventually exploit (even if in a limited/untargeted manner), we probably need to also fix this in Icehouse and publish a security advisory for it.

Gary, would you be willing to backport your fix to the stable/icehouse branch?

I took a stab at resolving the merge conflicts to backport the fix for stable/icehouse (hopefully I didn't butcher it \*too\* badly).

Based on some early feedback in IRC from Tristan, revised impact description proposal:

# [oss-security] [OSSA 2014-035] Nova VMware driver may connect VNC to another tenant's console (CVE-2014-8750)

### Bug Description

When spawning some instances, nova VMware driver could have a race condition in VNC port allocation. Although the get\_vnc\_port function has a lock it not guarantee that the whole vnc port allocation process is locked, so another instance could receive the same port if it requests the VNC port before nova has finished the vnc port allocation to another VM.

If the instances with the same VNC port are allocated in same host it could lead to a improper access to the instance console.

Reproduce the problem: Launch two or more instances at same time. In some cases one instance could execute the get\_vnc\_port and pick a port but before this instance has finished the \_set\_vnc\_config another instance could execute get\_vnc\_port and pick the same port.

How often this occurs: unpredictable.

Could this behavior be controlled by a would-be attacker, or is it only up to random chance? If the former then like [bug 1058077](/bugs/1058077)/[bug 1125378](/bugs/1125378) the VMT would likely deem it a security vulnerability. If the latter like [bug 1255609](/bugs/1255609) we would most probably not.

Since it looks like something an attacker could probably leverage repetition to eventually exploit (even if in a limited/untargeted manner), we probably need to also fix this in Icehouse and publish a security advisory for it.

Gary, would you be willing to backport your fix to the stable/icehouse branch?

Title: Nova VMware driver connects VNC to console of another tenant

Reporter: Marcio Roberto Starke

Products: Nova

Versions: up to 2014.1.3

Description:

Marcio Roberto Starke reported a vulnerability in the Nova VMware driver. A race condition in its VNC port allocation causes it to connect the wrong console, potentially even one on an instance belonging to another tenant, if these instances are created concurrently. Only Nova setups using the VMware driver and the VNC proxy service are affected.

I took a stab at resolving the merge conflicts to backport the fix for stable/icehouse (hopefully I didn't butcher it \*too\* badly).

Based on some early feedback in IRC from Tristan, revised impact description proposal:

-----

Title: Nova VMware driver connects VNC to console of another tenant

Reporter: Marcio Roberto Starke

Products: Nova

Versions: up to 2014.1.3

Description:

Marcio Roberto Starke reported a vulnerability in the Nova VMware driver. A race condition in its VNC port allocation causes it to connect the wrong console if instances are created concurrently. By repeatedly spawning new instances, an authenticated user may be able to gain unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants. Only Nova setups using the VMware driver and the VNC proxy service are affected.

Impact desc makes it look like it will always fail to connect to the right tenant, while in most case, it does. I propose:

Title: Nova VMware driver may connect VNC to another tenant's console

"may cause" in Description

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix two security issues, multiple
bugs, and add enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

CVE-2014-2573, the fix for which was provided with the initial release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 6, describes a flaw in the nova VMware driver. An authenticated user
could exceed their quota by placing an image into rescue and then deleting
it, causing the rescue image to be left behind.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-2573 was incomplete. A virtual
machine could be forced into the ERROR state from rescue by issuing a
suspend command. Virtual machines deleted from the ERROR state would still
leave the rescue image behind, allowing a user to exceed their quota. Note
that only setups using the nova VMware driver were affected.
(CVE-2014-3608)

The CVE-2014-3608 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of Red Hat Product
Security.

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149749)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Synopsis

Important: openstack-nova security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1689)

## Topic

Updated openstack-nova packages that fix one security issue, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1146086)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Prior to this update, certain RPC messages were not sending the correct

data format when the version cap was set. During a live upgrade from Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux
OpenStack Platform 5.0, when there were Compute nodes running different
versions of the code, some operations would fail on the Compute hosts that
were not upgraded. With this update, proper version of the data is sent in
all cases, and all RPC calls succeed during the live migration.
(BZ#1083625)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

Subject: [OSSA 2014-035] Nova VMware driver may connect VNC to another
 tenant's console (CVE-2014-8750)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-035
CVE: CVE-2014-8750
Date: October 14, 2014
Title: Nova VMware driver may connect VNC to another tenant's console
Reporter: Marcio Roberto Starke
Products: Nova
Versions: up to 2014.1.3

Description:
Marcio Roberto Starke reported a vulnerability in the Nova VMware
driver. A race condition in its VNC port allocation may cause it to
connect the wrong console if instances are created concurrently. By
repeatedly spawning new instances, an authenticated user may be able
to gain unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other
tenants. Only Nova setups using the VMware driver and the VNC proxy
service are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/114548>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/126425>

Notes:
This fix was included in the 2014.2rc1 release candidate and will
appear in a future 2014.1.4 stable point release.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual
machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.
Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to
orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing
networks, and controlling access through users and projects.

A race condition flaw was found in the way the nova VMware driver handled
VNC port allocation. An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain
unauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by
repeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the
VMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)

CVE-2014-2573, the fix for which was provided with the initial release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7, describes a flaw in the nova VMware driver. An authenticated user
could exceed their quota by placing an image into rescue and then deleting
it, causing the rescue image to be left behind.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-2573 was incomplete. A virtual
machine could be forced into the ERROR state from rescue by issuing a
suspend command. Virtual machines deleted from the ERROR state would still
leave the rescue image behind, allowing a user to exceed their quota. Note
that only setups using the nova VMware driver were affected.
(CVE-2014-3608)

The CVE-2014-3608 issue was discovered by Garth Mollett of Red Hat Product
Security.

The openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149737)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* Previously, unhandled database deadlock conditions triggered with some

database configuration edge cases. "Deadlock found when trying to get lock;
try restarting transaction" messages may have been logged, and database
transactions may have been lost. With this update, actions are retried on
deadlock conditions, resulting in robust database communication.
(BZ#1141972)

All openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Neutron

There is a known issue in all Havana releases that results in Neutron DHCP agent constantly resyncing its state once a network and a subnet
is created with a gateway outside of it. To avoid this, users are encouraged to set force\_gateway\_on\_subnet to True in neutron.conf. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1304181](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1304181)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
