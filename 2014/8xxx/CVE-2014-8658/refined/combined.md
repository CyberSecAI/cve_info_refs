# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20141029-1 >
=======================================================================
              title: Persistent cross site scripting
            product: Confluence RefinedWiki Original Theme
 vulnerable version: 3.x - 4.0.x
      fixed version: 4.0.12
             impact: high
           homepage: <http://www.refinedwiki.com/>
              found: 2014-08-07
                 by: Manuel Hofer
                     SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab
                     <https://www.sec-consult.com>
=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
"RefinedWiki Original Theme is the perfect add-on for smarter collaboration
and documentation. It can turn Confluence into an Intranet or Extranet and
with improved organization, more intuitive navigation and customizable
designs, your whole team will love using Confluence."

<http://www.refinedwiki.com/en/display/products.aspx>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting this vulnerability, users that are able to create or edit
content, can attack other users of confluence. An attacker might be able to
gain access to otherwise protected information in confluence.

It is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of RefinedWiki Original
Theme.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

The vulnerability can be used to persistently include HTML- or JavaScript
code to the "Activity Stream" of confluence. The code is executed in the
browser of users if they visit the manipulated site. The vulnerability can be
used to change the contents of the displayed site, redirect to other sites or
steal user credentials. Additionally, confluence users are potential victims
of browser exploits and JavaScript Trojans.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting
A user with the necessary permissions to create or edit content in Confluence
can exploit this vulnerability by placing the XSS payload inside the
vulnerable POST parameter "versionComment" as shown in the following request.

```
> ```
> POST /pages/doeditpage.action?pageId=111111 HTTP/1.1
> [...]
> atl_token=5aabd74e50724eaac8290a3447d9f6e7a179559e&originalVersion=5
> &title=Title&wysiwygContent=[REMOVED]&watchPageAfterComment=true
> &versionComment=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
> &notifyWatchers=true&confirm=Save&viewPermissionsUsers=
> &editPermissionsUsers=&viewPermissionsGroups=&editPermissionsGroups=
> &parentPageString=&moveHierarchy=true&position=&targetId=&draftId=0
> &entityId=9012708&newSpaceKey=tools
>
> ```

```

The submitted XSS payload gets executed every time a user visits the activity
stream of the edited page.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
According to the vendor, the affected versions are RefinedWiki Original Theme
are 3.x - 4.0.x.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
