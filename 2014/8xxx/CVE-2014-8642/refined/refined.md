{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the failure to properly recognize the `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` extension in delegated Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) responder certificates. If this extension is present in a delegated OCSP response signing certificate, it will be discarded if it is signed by such a certificate.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The core weakness is the improper handling of the `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` extension, leading to a failure in OCSP response verification. This specifically manifests when a delegated OCSP responder certificate with the mentioned extension signs an OCSP response, and the extension is ignored.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The impact is that a user may connect to a site with a revoked certificate because the software will discard the Revoked/Unknown response signed by the delegated OCSP responder certificate containing the `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` extension. The software may ignore the valid OCSP response.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious or compromised OCSP responder providing a certificate with the `id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck` extension, causing the software to ignore revocation status.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the OCSP response provided to the user's browser, by controlling or compromising the delegated OCSP responder or the network path."
