# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 April 2015
* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016

# Security Bulletin: CVE-2014-8298: GLX-Indirect (Including CVE-2014-8093, CVE-2014-8098)

Updated 09/29/2021 10:17 AM

## CVE-2014-8298: GLX-Indirect (Including CVE-2014-8093, CVE-2014-8098)

## Go to [NVIDIA Product Security](http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-security.html).

---

**Vulnerability Description:**

The GLX indirect rendering support supplied on NVIDIA products is subject to the recently disclosed X.Org vulnerabilities ([CVE-2014-8093](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8093), [CVE-2014-8098](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8098)) as well as internally identified vulnerabilities ([CVE-2014-8298](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8298)).

**Exploit Scope and Risk:**

Depending on how it is configured, the X server typically runs with raised privileges, and listens for GLX indirect rendering protocol requests from a local socket and potentially a TCP/IP port. The vulnerabilities could be exploited in a way that causes the X server to access uninitialized memory or overwrite arbitrary memory in the X server process. This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

The [CVSS](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm) Risk assessment is listed below.

CVSS Base Score - 8.3

Exploitability sub-score - 6.5

Access Vector: Adjacent Network

Access Complexity: Low

Authentication: None

Impact sub-score - 10.0

Confidentiality Impact: Complete

Integrity Impact: Complete

Availability Impact: Complete

CVSS temporal sub-score - 3.5

Exploitability: Unproven that Exploit Exists

Remediation Level: Workaround

Report Confidence: Confirmed

CVSS Environmental Score - [determined by user]

NVIDIA's risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation. We recommended consulting a local security or IT professional to evaluate the risk of your specific configuration. NVIDIA knows of no known exploits to these issues at this time.

**Vulnerable Configurations:**

The NVIDIA implementation of GLX indirect rendering is only used in the NVIDIA GPU drivers for Solaris, FreeBSD, VMware ESX, and other Linux based operating systems where an X server is in use. NVIDIA GPU drivers for other operating systems are not affected.

**Vulnerability Discovery:**

NVIDIA was informed of this issue by public advisement from X.Org participants on Oct 9, 2014, by Adam Jackson and Alan Coopersmith. Internal analysis and additional issues refined by Robert Morell of NVIDIA.

**Fix:**

NVIDIA recommends that users upgrade their drivers. Refer to the table below for recommended driver updates and locations.

 Refer to the table below for recommended driver updates and locations.
| **Driver** | **Scheduled Support Date** |

| **Chrome OS** |  |
| R40 or better | Contact Google support for release information |
| **CUDA Toolkit SDK** | [CUDA Toolkit SDK Download](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)  **To patch the CUDA Toolkit SDK 6.0 and 6.5 installation, install the updated drivers with the security patch from Release 331 and Release 340 For CUDA 5.5, Release 319 is no longer supported, however all toolkits are compatible with later drivers. Customers should install the patch from Release 331 or 340** |
| CUDA 5.5 | R331.113 or R340.65, available as of 12/9 |
| CUDA 6.0 | R331.113 available as of 12/9 |
| CUDA 6.5 | R340.65 available as of 12/9 |

**Mitigations:**

You may consider either of the following steps to help further mitigate against GLX protocol vulnerabilities:

* Configure the X server to prohibit X connections from the local area network **(**by passing the "-nolisten tcp" command line option to the X.Org X server). Many Linux distributions already set this option by default. Consult your operating system's documentation for details on setting X server command line options
* Disable GLX indirect contexts. With any of the fixed NVIDIA driver versions mentioned above, indirect GLX contexts can be prohibited by setting the "AllowIndirectGLXProtocol" X configuration option to False, or setting the "-iglx" X server command line option on X.Org 1.16 or newer.
