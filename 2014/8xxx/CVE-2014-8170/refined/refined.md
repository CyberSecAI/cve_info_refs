{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unsafe quoting of input strings when constructing command lines in ovirt-node.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command injection vulnerability due to improper handling of user-controlled input in command line arguments.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who can control the input string passed to the vulnerable command can execute arbitrary commands on the host with the privileges of the user running ovirt-node.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing specially crafted input strings, such as filenames, that contain shell metacharacters or commands, an attacker can inject commands into the command line executed by the system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be either an authenticated user or have physical access to the system. Both of these would typically allow them to execute more severe attacks, making this specific vulnerability less critical in such scenarios."
