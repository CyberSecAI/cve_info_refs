Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-8090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8080 in the Ruby REXML XML parser.  While the initial fix introduced a limit on the size of expanded text, it failed to limit the number of entity expansions. This means that even with the initial fix in place, a small XML document with nested entities could still cause excessive CPU usage through recursive expansion of these entities. Additionally, high memory usage can be achieved using larger inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** The primary vulnerability was that the fix for CVE-2014-8080 was incomplete. The previous patches fixed recursive expansions in a number of places and the total size of created Strings, but did not take into account the former limit used for entity expansion.
*   **Unrestricted Entity Expansion:**  The REXML parser didn't have proper restrictions on the number of expansions it could perform, leading to a potential for denial-of-service.
*    **Recursive Expansion:** Specifically, recursive expansion with an empty string could cause a denial of service due to excessive CPU consumption

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **CPU Exhaustion:**  The vulnerability can cause 100% CPU utilization due to the recursive expansion.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The vulnerability can force the allocation of extremely large string objects, potentially consuming all available memory and leading to a crash or system slowdown.
*   **Resource Consumption:** The vulnerability causes excessive consumption of CPU and memory resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML Documents:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious XML documents that exploit the parser's entity expansion behavior. These documents could be small in size, but contain nested entities designed to trigger a large number of expansions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide input to a Ruby application parsing XML:** An attacker must be able to send or provide a specially crafted XML document to a Ruby application using the vulnerable REXML parser. This could involve sending the XML via an HTTP request, or processing a local XML file. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerability is located in the way REXML handles parameter entity expansion. Specifically, the code fails to impose a limit on the number of expansions that can occur within a document.
* The issue is triggered during the reading of text nodes in XML documents. The REXML parser, when dealing with these text nodes, can be manipulated into allocating extremely large string objects by recursive expansion.
* The fix involves introducing restrictions to limit the number of expansions performed, i.e. checks against the `REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit`, and adding a `REXML::Document#document` method to `lib/rexml/document.rb`.

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability is a follow-up to CVE-2014-8080, addressing a weakness in the initial patch.
* The vulnerability is similar to, but distinct from the "Billion Laughs" attack which exploits general entities instead of parameter entities.
* The vulnerability affects several versions of Ruby, and fixes were provided for 1.9.3, 2.0.0, and 2.1.x branches.
* There are workarounds involving monkey-patching the `REXML::Document` class to mitigate the vulnerability if upgrading to a patched version of Ruby is not immediately possible.
