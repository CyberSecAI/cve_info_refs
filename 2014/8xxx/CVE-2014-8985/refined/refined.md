This document provides information on a security update (MS14-051) that addresses multiple vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, including CVE-2014-8985.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This means they could gain the same user rights as the logged-in user, potentially taking complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability, or compromise legitimate websites. The attacker would then have to convince the user to visit the malicious site, typically via phishing or other social engineering methods.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate website and convince the victim to visit it using Internet Explorer. No other special capabilities or position is mentioned.
