# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 193 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](https://blogs.oracle.com/security/).

**Please note that on May 15, 2015, Oracle released  [Security Alert for CVE-2015-3456 (QEMU "Venom")](/security-alerts/cve-2015-3456.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2015-3456.**

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in previous [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) . An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2015 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2005667.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2005667.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) .

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 23 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

# X.Org Security Advisory: Dec. 9, 2014

## Protocol handling issues in X Window System servers

### Description

Ilja van Sprundel, a security researcher with IOActive, has discovered a large
number of issues in the way the X server code base handles requests from X
clients, and has worked with X.Org's security team to analyze, confirm, and fix
these issues.

Ilja's talk at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress (30C3) in Hamburg
last year (*[X Security: it's worse than it looks](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5499_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312291830_-_x_security_-_ilja_van_sprundel.html)*)
gave a preview of these issues and discussed the general form of many of these,
but did not disclose the exact details of them.

The vulnerabilities could be exploited to cause the X server to access
uninitialized memory or overwrite arbitrary memory in the X server process.
This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or
could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

How critical these vulnerabilities are to any given installation depends on
whether they run an X server with root privileges or reduced privileges; whether
they run X servers exposed to network clients or limited to local connections;
and whether or not they allow use of the affected protocol extensions,
especially the GLX extension.

The GLX extension to the X Window System allows an X client to send X protocol
to the X server, to request that the X server perform OpenGL rendering on behalf
of the X client. This is known as âGLX indirect renderingâ, as opposed to âGLX
direct renderingâ where the X client submits OpenGL rendering commands directly
to the GPU, bypassing the X server and avoiding the X server code for GLX
protocol handling.

Most GLX indirect rendering implementations share some common ancestry, dating
back to âSample Implementationâ code from Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI), which SGI
originally commercially licensed to other Unix workstation and graphics vendors,
and later released as open source, so those vulnerabilities may affect other
licensees of SGI's code base beyond those running code from the X.Org Foundation
or the XFree86 Project.

The vulnerabilities include:

*denial of service due to unchecked malloc in client authentication*

CVE-2014-8091: In servers built with support for SUN-DES-1 (Secure RPC)
authentication credentials, an unauthenticated client may be able to crash
the X server by sending a connection request specifying values that cause
malloc to fail, causing the authentication routines to attempt to write data
to the returned NULL pointer. Since the request is limited to an unsigned
16-bit integer for the allocation size, it is unlikely to fail unless the
server is severely memory constrained.

Introduced in the initial revision of Secure RPC support in [X11R5](../../../X11R5/) (1991).

*integer overflows calculating memory needs for requests*

These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
is needed to handle the client's request have not overflowed, so can
result in out of bounds reads or writes. These calls all occur only
after a client has successfully authenticated itself.

CVE-2014-8092: X11 core protocol requests

Affected functions: ProcPutImage(), GetHosts(), RegionSizeof(),
REQUEST\_FIXED\_SIZE()

Introduced in [X11R1](../../../X11R1/) (1987).

CVE-2014-8093: GLX extension

Affected functions: \_\_glXDisp\_ReadPixels(), \_\_glXDispSwap\_ReadPixels(),
\_\_glXDisp\_GetTexImage(), \_\_glXDispSwap\_GetTexImage(),
GetSeparableFilter(), GetConvolutionFilter(), GetHistogram(),
GetMinmax(), GetColorTable(), \_\_glXGetAnswerBuffer(),

Map2Size(), \_\_glXMap2dReqSize(), \_\_glXMap2fReqSize(),
\_\_glXImageSize(), \_\_glXSeparableFilter2DReqSize()

Originally developed by SGI and licensed to multiple vendors
prior to SGI open sourcing the code in 1999.

Included in XFree86 releases starting in XFree86 4.0 (2000).

Included in X.Org releases starting in [X11R6.7](../../../Releases/6.7/) (2004).

CVE-2014-8094: DRI2 extension

Affected functions: ProcDRI2GetBuffers()

Introduced in [xorg-server-1.7.0](../../../Server17Branch/) (2009).

*out of bounds access due to not validating length or offset values in requests*

These calls do not check that the lengths and/or indexes sent by the
client are within the bounds specified by the caller or the bounds of
the memory allocated to hold the request read from the client, so could
read or write past the bounds of allocated memory while processing the
request. These calls all occur only after a client has successfully
authenticated itself.

Affected functions: SProcXChangeDeviceControl(),
ProcXChangeDeviceControl(), ProcXChangeFeedbackControl(),
ProcXSendExtensionEvent(), SProcXIAllowEvents(), SProcXIChangeCursor(),

Fixes are also planned to be included in the xorg-server-1.17.0 and
xorg-server-1.16.3 releases.

Other providers of Xserver or GLX implementations based on the same
code base (the X Consortium or X.Org Foundation X sources, or the SGI
GLX sources) will announce the availability of any fixes necessary for
their implementations.

### Mitigation

While the fixes cover all the cases currently known to X.Org, these are
not the first issues in this area and are unlikely to be the last.

Users can reduce their exposure to issues similar to the ones in this
advisory via these methods:

* Configure the X server to prohibit X connections from the network
  by passing the **-nolisten tcp** command line option to the X
  server. Many OS distributions already set this option by default,
  and it will be set by default in the upstream X.Org release
  starting with Xorg 1.17.
* Disable GLX indirect contexts. Some implementations have a
  configuration option for this. In Xorg 1.16 or newer, this can be
  achieved by setting the **-iglx** X server command line option.
  This option will be the default in Xorg 1.17 and later releases.

Consult your operating system's documentation for details on setting X
server command line options, as X servers are started by a variety of
different methods on different platforms (startx, gdm, kdm, xdm, etc.).

### Thanks

X.Org thanks Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive for reporting these issues to our
security team and assisting them in understanding them and evaluating our
fixes, and the following X.Org contributors for developing and reviewing
the fixes, tests, and advisory for these issues, and coordinating the
X.Org response to them:

* Adam Jackson (Red Hat)
* Alan Coopersmith (Oracle)
* Andy Ritger (NVIDIA)
* Julien Cristau (Debian)
* Keith Packard (Intel)
* Michal Srb (SuSE)
* Peter Hutterer (Red Hat)

### glx: Fix mask truncation in \_\_glXGetAnswerBuffer [CVE-2014-8093 6/6]

```

On a system where sizeof(unsigned) != sizeof(intptr_t), the unary
bitwise not operation will result in a mask that clears all high bits
from temp_buf in the expression:
        temp_buf = (temp_buf + mask) & ~mask;

### glx: Be more strict about rejecting invalid image sizes [CVE-2014-8093 2/6]

```

Before this we'd just clamp the image size to 0, which was just
hideously stupid; if the parameters were such that they'd overflow an
integer, you'd allocate a small buffer, then pass huge values into (say)
ReadPixels, and now you're scribbling over arbitrary server memory.

### glx: Add safe\_{add,mul,pad} (v3) [CVE-2014-8093 4/6]

```

These are paranoid about integer overflow, and will return -1 if their
operation would overflow a (signed) integer or if either argument is
negative.

Note that RenderLarge requests are sized with a uint32_t so in principle
this could be sketchy there, but dix limits bigreqs to 128M so you
shouldn't ever notice, and honestly if you're sending more than 2G of
rendering commands you're already doing something very wrong.

v2: Use INT_MAX for consistency with the rest of the server (jcristau)
v3: Reject negative arguments (anholt)

# Security Bulletin: CVE-2014-8298: GLX-Indirect (Including CVE-2014-8093, CVE-2014-8098)

Updated 09/29/2021 10:17 AM

## CVE-2014-8298: GLX-Indirect (Including CVE-2014-8093, CVE-2014-8098)

## Go to [NVIDIA Product Security](http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-security.html).

---

**Vulnerability Description:**

The GLX indirect rendering support supplied on NVIDIA products is subject to the recently disclosed X.Org vulnerabilities ([CVE-2014-8093](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8093), [CVE-2014-8098](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8098)) as well as internally identified vulnerabilities ([CVE-2014-8298](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8298)).

**Exploit Scope and Risk:**

Depending on how it is configured, the X server typically runs with raised privileges, and listens for GLX indirect rendering protocol requests from a local socket and potentially a TCP/IP port. The vulnerabilities could be exploited in a way that causes the X server to access uninitialized memory or overwrite arbitrary memory in the X server process. This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

The [CVSS](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm) Risk assessment is listed below.

CVSS Base Score - 8.3

Exploitability sub-score - 6.5

Access Vector: Adjacent Network

Access Complexity: Low

Authentication: None

Impact sub-score - 10.0

Confidentiality Impact: Complete

Integrity Impact: Complete

Availability Impact: Complete

CVSS temporal sub-score - 3.5

Exploitability: Unproven that Exploit Exists

Remediation Level: Workaround

Report Confidence: Confirmed

CVSS Environmental Score - [determined by user]

NVIDIA's risk assessment is based on an average of risk across a diverse set of installed systems and may not represent the true risk of your local installation. We recommended consulting a local security or IT professional to evaluate the risk of your specific configuration. NVIDIA knows of no known exploits to these issues at this time.

**Vulnerable Configurations:**

The NVIDIA implementation of GLX indirect rendering is only used in the NVIDIA GPU drivers for Solaris, FreeBSD, VMware ESX, and other Linux based operating systems where an X server is in use. NVIDIA GPU drivers for other operating systems are not affected.

**Vulnerability Discovery:**

NVIDIA was informed of this issue by public advisement from X.Org participants on Oct 9, 2014, by Adam Jackson and Alan Coopersmith. Internal analysis and additional issues refined by Robert Morell of NVIDIA.

**Fix:**

NVIDIA recommends that users upgrade their drivers. Refer to the table below for recommended driver updates and locations.

Customers should install the patch from Release 331 or 340** |
| CUDA 5.5 | R331.113 or R340.65, available as of 12/9 |
| CUDA 6.0 | R331.113 available as of 12/9 |
| CUDA 6.5 | R340.65 available as of 12/9 |

**Mitigations:**

You may consider either of the following steps to help further mitigate against GLX protocol vulnerabilities:

* Configure the X server to prohibit X connections from the local area network **(**by passing the "-nolisten tcp" command line option to the X.Org X server). Many Linux distributions already set this option by default. Consult your operating system's documentation for details on setting X server command line options
* Disable GLX indirect contexts. With any of the fixed NVIDIA driver versions mentioned above, indirect GLX contexts can be prohibited by setting the "AllowIndirectGLXProtocol" X configuration option to False, or setting the "-iglx" X server command line option on X.Org 1.16 or newer.

### glx: Fix image size computation for EXT\_texture\_integer [CVE-2014-8098 1/8]

```

Without this we'd reject the request with BadLength.  Note that some old
versions of Mesa had a bug in the same place, and would _send_ zero
bytes of image data; these will now be rejected, correctly.

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

### glx: Be more paranoid about variable-length requests [CVE-2014-8093 1/6]

```

If the size computation routine returns -1 we should just reject the
request outright.  Clamping it to zero could give an attacker the
opportunity to also mangle cmdlen in such a way that the subsequent
length check passes, and the request would get executed, thus passing
data we wanted to reject to the renderer.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
