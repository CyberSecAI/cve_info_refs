{
  "CVE-2014-8093": {
    "Root cause": "Integer overflows when calculating memory needs for requests in the GLX extension of the X Window System server.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerabilities in multiple GLX functions when processing requests from X clients.",
       "Lack of checks to ensure calculations for required memory do not overflow."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause out-of-bounds reads or writes in the X server process. This can lead to a denial-of-service (e.g., X server segmentation fault), or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious X client can send specially crafted GLX requests to the X server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the X server as an authenticated client and send GLX protocol requests to it."
  }
