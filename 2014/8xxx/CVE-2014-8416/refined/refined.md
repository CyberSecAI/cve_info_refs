- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `res_pjsip_refer` module incorrectly assumes it's operating on a newly created channel when handling an INVITE with Replaces message, which is incorrect if the message is sent after a session has been established.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect assumption about channel state in `res_pjsip_refer` module. This leads to use-after-free condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A remote attacker can cause a denial-of-service (crash) by sending a specially crafted INVITE message.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an INVITE message with the Replaces header in-dialog after a session has already been established.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote, unauthenticated attacker. The attacker needs to be able to send SIP INVITE messages to an Asterisk server.
