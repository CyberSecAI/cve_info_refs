{
  "CVE-2014-8177": {
    "Description": "A flaw was found in the metadata constraints in Red Hat Gluster Storage's OpenStack Object Storage (swiftonfile). By adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user could bypass the max_meta_count constraint, and store more metadata than allowed by the configuration.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how metadata constraints are enforced in gluster-swift, allowing bypass of the max_meta_count limit.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect enforcement of metadata constraints",
      "Ability to bypass max_meta_count limitation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user could bypass the max_meta_count constraint, leading to storage of more metadata than intended.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Adding metadata in several separate calls"
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "An authenticated user with the ability to make calls to add metadata to storage.",
    "Additional details": "This issue affects Red Hat Gluster Storage's OpenStack Object Storage (swiftonfile). The fix is available in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 update 1."
