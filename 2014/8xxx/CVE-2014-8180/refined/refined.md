**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The MongoDB instance in Red Hat Satellite 6 was configured without a password by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Local users with access to the system could connect to the MongoDB instance and delete critical information, causing a denial of service.
- **Data Loss/Modification:** Malicious local users could potentially modify or delete sensitive data stored in the database, leading to data loss or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must have local user access to the Red Hat Satellite 6 system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the system where Red Hat Satellite 6 is installed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by documenting how to restrict access to mongod, which is available at the provided link.
- The bug report indicates that the issue was fixed in documentation rather than in the software itself by providing instructions on securing the MongoDB instance.
