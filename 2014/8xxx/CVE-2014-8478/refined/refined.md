- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server of the affected switches does not properly validate incoming HTTP requests, which leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) in the web server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a device reboot by sending malformed HTTP requests, leading to a denial of service. No packets are forwarded to connected devices until the reboot is completed.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack via HTTP (port 80/tcp) or HTTPS (port 443/tcp).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have network access to the device's HTTP interface.
