- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input before displaying it, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Reflected XSS: The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS through the login username field.
    - Persistent XSS: The application is vulnerable to persistent XSS through configuration parameters (install\_name, intro\_message, and new\_file\_content).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Reflected XSS: An attacker can craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the username field. When a victim clicks this URL, the script will be executed.
    - Persistent XSS: An attacker can inject a malicious script through the configuration parameters, which will be stored in the database. When other users access the page that displays these parameters, the script will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to submit a crafted username in a login request and to access the configuration interface of the application to set malicious configuration parameters.
