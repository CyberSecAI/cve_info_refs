Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-8948:

**Root Cause:**
The iMember360 WordPress plugin versions 3.8.012 through 3.9.001 contain multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input validation and lack of proper permission checks on various $_GET parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Disclosure of database credentials:** The `i4w_dbinfo` parameter exposes sensitive database information like database name, user, password, and encoding. In versions prior to 3.9.001, this was directly accessible. In later versions, it's accessible when an admin URL is accessed by a registered user.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `decrypt` and `encrypt` parameters directly output their values without sanitization, leading to XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker could inject malicious Javascript code, potentially leading to phishing attacks or other malicious activities.
*   **Arbitrary user deletion:** The `i4w_clearuser` and `Email` parameters allow an attacker to delete arbitrary users from the WordPress database. This is especially exploitable when the plugin license is not yet activated, as the API key check can be bypassed.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The `i4w_trace` parameter allows an authenticated admin user to execute arbitrary code on the system shell. The code placed between the ";" and "#" characters is executed directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database credential disclosure:** Could allow an attacker to gain complete access to the database, leading to data breaches, manipulation, or deletion.
*  **XSS vulnerabilities:** Could allow an attacker to perform phishing attacks, redirect users to malicious sites, steal cookies or perform other actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
*   **Arbitrary user deletion:** Can be used to disrupt services by deleting user accounts or cause further attacks by deleting admin accounts.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** This could allow an attacker to completely compromise the server, steal data, install malware, or perform other harmful actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious URLs with specific $_GET parameters, typically accessed via a web browser. Phishing attacks are also a vector to lure users to malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Database credential disclosure:** No authentication needed prior to version 3.9.001. After 3.9.001, a registered user must access an admin URL.
*   **XSS vulnerabilities:** No authentication needed.
*  **Arbitrary user deletion:** Requires knowledge of a user's login name. Exploit is easier if plugin is not licensed.
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Requires the attacker to convince an authenticated administrator to click on a malicious link or access a crafted URL when logged in as an admin.
