Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8636:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from how XrayWrappers, a security mechanism in Mozilla products, handle Document Object Model (DOM) objects with named accessors. Specifically, named getters could bypass XrayWrappers by shadowing native or ES properties or by deleting properties that are used for security checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **XrayWrapper Bypass:** DOM objects with specific properties could bypass the intended security of XrayWrappers.
*   **Property Shadowing:** Content could shadow native properties (e.g., `getElementById`) or ES properties, leading to the confusion of privileged code.
*   **Property Deletion:** Content could delete properties, used by XrayWrappers in security checks, thus circumventing the intended protection.
*   **Prototype Manipulation:** Content can manipulate the prototype chain of DOM objects allowing to influence the lookup of methods and properties in unexpected ways.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By confusing privileged code, an attacker could escalate privileges.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  As further discovered, setting a prototype to a proxy object enabled web content to open privileged windows with the `chrome` property, leading to RCE as described in the `bug 1120261` comments.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use of a proxy object to intercept properties also caused a DoS by hanging the browser.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Web Content:**  Malicious web pages or web content loaded in a browser context.
*   **JavaScript Execution:** Exploitation involves the execution of malicious JavaScript code within a vulnerable browser.
*  **User Interaction:** User interaction with a page, like clicking, could trigger the exploit.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** An attacker must be able to serve a malicious web page or otherwise inject malicious content into a context where it can be processed by the browser.
*   **JavaScript Execution:**  The attacker requires the ability to execute JavaScript within the user's browser.
*   **No User interaction is needed** for the DoS attack.
*   **User Interaction:** A click on the page by the user is needed to trigger some of the exploit scenarios.
*   **Basic Javascript knowledge** is required to manipulate object properties and proxies

**Additional details:**
The vulnerability was initially identified by Bobby Holley, and additional exploit details, especially concerning RCE, were discovered by Joe Vennix (Rapid7). The fix involved preventing XrayWrappers from being unwrapped in the `HasPropertyOnPrototype` function and also correctly implementing Xray prototypes to maintain chain integrity and prevent property manipulations.

The bug report for `bug 1120261` provides significant details, including a working proof-of-concept RCE exploit, confirming that the issue was exploitable and leading to a fix in Firefox 35 and ESR31. It also highlights how the use of a Proxy object on the `document.__proto__` allowed for hijacking method calls and execution of code in chrome context.
