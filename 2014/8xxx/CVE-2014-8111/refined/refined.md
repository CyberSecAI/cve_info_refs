  "CVE-2014-8111": {
    "description": "A vulnerability has been found in the mod_jk connector relating to the use of JkMount and JkUnmount. A JkUnmount rule for a subtree of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker to potentially access a private artifact in a directory tree that would otherwise not be accessible to them.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect processing of JkMount/JkUnmount directives within the mod_jk connector.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "A JkUnmount rule for a subtree of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored, leading to information exposure.",
       "Improper handling of mount/unmount directives resulting in bypass of intended access control."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attacker could potentially access a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be accessible to them.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation via sending specially crafted requests which are forwarded by Apache to Tomcat using mod_jk connector.",
       "Network-based exploitation by sending malformed JkMount/JkUnmount directives that bypass intended unmount paths."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send requests to the server using the mod_jk connector. No authentication required.",
       "more_info": "The vulnerability affects all versions of mod_jk. Fixed in Apache Tomcat JK Connector 1.2.41. Also affects Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (6.4.z) and JBoss Web Server (2.x)."
