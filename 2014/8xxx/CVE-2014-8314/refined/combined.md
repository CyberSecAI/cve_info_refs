4. Affected Components Description
==================================

SAP HANA is a platform for real-time business. It combines database,
data processing, and application platform capabilities in-memory. The
platform provides libraries for predictive, planning, text processing,
spatial, and business analytics.

5. Vulnerability Details
========================

The SAP HANA Developer Edition contains multiple reflected Cross Site
Scripting Vulnerabilities (XSS) in the democontent area, specifically on
the pages:

/sap/hana/democontent/epm/admin/DataGen.xsjs
/sap/hana/democontent/epm/services/multiply.xsjs

A reflected cross-site scripting attack can be used to non-permanently
deface or modify displayed content from a Web site. Reflected cross-site
scripting can be used to steal another user's authentication
information, such as data relating to their current session. An attacker
who gains access to this data may use it to impersonate the user and
access all information with the same rights as the target user. If an
administrator is impersonated, the security of he application may be
fully compromised.

6. Solution
===========

SAP has released SAP Note 2009696 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://service.sap.com/sap/support/notes/2009696>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
