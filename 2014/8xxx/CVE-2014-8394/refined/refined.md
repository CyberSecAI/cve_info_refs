Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a DLL hijacking issue in Corel CAD 2014. When a file associated with Corel CAD 2014 is opened, the application searches for specific DLL files ("FxManagedCommands_3.08_9.tx" or "TD_Mgd_3.08_9.dll") in the same directory as the opened document without validating the path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The application does not properly control the search path used to locate the required DLL files. It prioritizes the directory of the opened document, allowing an attacker to place a malicious DLL there.
- **DLL Hijacking:** By placing a specially crafted DLL with the same name as the required DLL in the document's directory, an attacker can force the application to load and execute their malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Corel CAD 2014 application. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - System compromise
    - Data theft or manipulation
    - Installation of malware
    - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Exploitation:** The attack requires a user to open a file associated with Corel CAD 2014 that is located in a directory containing the malicious DLL.
- **Malicious File Distribution:** An attacker could distribute a specially crafted Corel CAD document along with the malicious DLL. When the victim opens the document, the DLL will be loaded and executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create/modify files:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify files.
- **File system access:** An attacker needs access to a file system, to place the malicious DLL alongside a document that a user will open with Corel CAD 2014.
- **Social engineering:** An attacker would likely need to use social engineering to trick a user into opening a malicious document.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability requires that Corel CAD 2014 is not running before the user opens the associated file.
