{
  "CVE-2014-8169": {
    "Description": "The autofs utility controls the operation of the automount daemon.  It was found that program-based automounter maps that used interpreted languages such as Python would use standard environment variables to locate and load modules of those languages. A local attacker could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.",
    "Root cause": "Program-based automounter maps using interpreted languages like Python were using standard environment variables to locate and load modules.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled search path",
      "Use of standard environment variables by a root process",
      "Lack of input validation of environment variables"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local privilege escalation",
    "Attack vector": "Local user can exploit this flaw to escalate privileges when program maps are configured in autofs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system, ability to create/modify files in the user's home directory.",
	 "Additional Information": "The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through sshd if it triggers autofs for the home directory, allowing a malicious user to compromise a remote host that mounts the user's directory by simply trying to fail an ssh authentication. The fix adds an \"AUTOFS_\" prefix to affected environment variables, preventing their misuse for module loading. A configuration option ('force_standard_program_map_env') was introduced to allow overriding this prefix."
