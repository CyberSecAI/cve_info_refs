{
  "CVE-2014-8133": {
    "description": "An information leak in the Linux kernel's Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation allows users to bypass the espfix to obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory.",
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel's Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation does not properly validate thread local storage entries, allowing a bypass of the espfix protection mechanism.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information leak",
      "ASLR bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. This can also enable bypassing of the ASLR protection mechanism.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A local user on the system."
