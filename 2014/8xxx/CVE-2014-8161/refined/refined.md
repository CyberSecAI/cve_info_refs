Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8161:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how PostgreSQL handles constraint violation error messages. Specifically, these messages sometimes include the values of columns that violate a constraint (e.g., a unique constraint).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leak: The core issue is that the error messages might display column values to users who do not have the necessary `SELECT` privileges on those columns. This can expose sensitive information that the user is not authorized to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential for unauthorized information disclosure. An attacker with limited privileges on a table could potentially gain access to sensitive data in columns they shouldn't normally be able to see.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through triggering constraint violations that result in error messages displaying unauthorized column values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated database user with some level of access to the table in question. The attacker must be able to craft or execute queries that will trigger constraint violation errors that would expose the column values. The user does not require explicit select privileges on the columns.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adjusting the code so that column values are only included in error messages if they originated from the SQL command that caused the error or if the user has explicit `SELECT` privileges on those columns.
- This vulnerability is considered to not be generally urgent because it requires prior authentication and specific conditions. However, users are advised to review the vulnerability and apply the patch if needed.
- The vulnerability was patched in versions 9.4.1, 9.3.6, 9.2.10, and 9.1.15.
