Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2014-8690:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Unsanitized URL Input:** Exponent CMS constructs the canonical path field from a URL without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the URL, which is then executed by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a universal XSS, meaning it can be triggered from various entry points due to the lack of sanitization.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize URL parameters and user-provided data, such as first and last names in user profiles, allowing for arbitrary script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the visual appearance of the website.
    *   **Redirection:** Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive user data.
*  **Account Takeover:** A logged-in user could be targeted with XSS through the user profile fields, potentially leading to account takeover if an attacker can gain control of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated URL Parameters:** By crafting a URL with malicious JavaScript within specific parameters, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability. Specifically the `title` and `src` parameters of the `news/show` route are vulnerable.
*   **User Profile Fields:** The "First Name" and "Last Name" fields in user profiles are vulnerable to stored XSS, where the injected script is saved and executed when the profile is viewed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with injected JavaScript code.
*   **Ability to input to user profile fields:**  The attacker needs an account to be able to exploit the stored XSS in the user profile fields.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim needs to visit the malicious URL or view a compromised user profile.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Mayuresh Dani and Narendra Shinde from Qualys.
*   The vulnerability was present in Exponent CMS versions 2.3.1 and prior.
*   Patches were released to address the issue. The patches primarily focused on scrubbing parameters coming in either by sef or query URL.
*   The exploit details included multiple examples demonstrating how to inject script into URLs to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The ticket also highlights that even logged-in users can be affected if they inject malicious javascript in their First Name or Last Name fields on the `users/edituser` endpoint.
