##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Aircrack-ng 1.2 Release candidate 1

Here is the [first release candidate](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/). I was wrong about saying there would be a fourth beta in [the post of the previous release](http://aircrack-ng.blogspot.com/2014/03/aircrack-ng-12-beta-3-release.html). There is exactly 7 month after the last beta. There will be most likely another one then the final release in the next few month.

Updating is highly recommend as this contains a lot of bug fixes and improvements as well as security fixes (CVE-2014-8321, CVE-2014-8322, CVE-2014-8323 and CVE-2014-8324). More details can be found in the blog.

Changelog:

* Airodump-ng should be able to parse the canonical oui file.
* Airodump-ng: Fixed GPS stack overflow.
* Airodump-ng: Fixed stopping cleanly with Ctrl-C.
* Airmon-zc: better handling for when modules are not available (incomplete)
* Airmon-zc: users can now start the monitor interface again to change channels
* Airmon-zc: update to use ip instead of ifconfig if available.
* Airmon-zc: better handling of devices without pci bus
* Aireplay-ng: Fixed tcp\_test stack overflow.
* OSdep: Fixed libnl detection. Also avoid detection on non Linux systems.
* OSdep: Fixed segmentation fault that happens with a malicious server.
* Besside-ng: Add regular expression matching for the SSID.
* Buddy-ng: Fixed segmentation fault.
* Makefile: Fixed 'commands commence before first target' error when building Aircrack-ng.
* Fixed segfault when changing the optimization when compiling with gcc thanks to Ramiro Polla.
* Removed airdriver-ng (outdated and not meant for today's kernels)
* Added gitignore file.
* Fixed build issues on other compilers by using stdint.h types.
* Updating installation file and added pkg-config as a requirement.
* Various small fixes and improvements.

   Seems more stable, but agree with the above comment. Loss of network when in mon-mode is a downgrade in functionality from previous version. Minor aesthetic issues with Airmon-ng info displayed too. Excellent work though and very much appreciated.
