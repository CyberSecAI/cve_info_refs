Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-8322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow in the `tcp_test` functionality of the `aireplay-ng` tool.
- The `nh_len` field from the network header is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to specify a length value that exceeds the buffer allocated on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Overflow:** By sending a crafted packet with a large `nh_len` field, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The program does not properly validate the length parameter from the network header received via the TCP socket.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The stack overflow can be exploited to overwrite the return address and redirect execution flow to attacker-controlled code, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `aireplay-ng --test` option, which listens on a specified TCP port.
- An attacker needs to send a specially crafted TCP packet to the listening port of the vulnerable `aireplay-ng` application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the machine running the vulnerable `aireplay-ng` application.
- The attacker must be able to send a TCP packet to the port specified by the `--test` option of `aireplay-ng`.
- The attacker needs to create a malicious payload that fits within the overflowed buffer on the stack.
- The attacker needs to know the architecture and OS to craft the shellcode payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit code provided demonstrates how to send a crafted TCP packet to trigger the overflow and achieve remote code execution.
- The provided exploit utilizes ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) to execute commands and establish a reverse shell.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Aircrack-ng version 1.2 Release Candidate 1
- The vulnerable version was 1.2 beta3
