- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `create` function of the Jease CMS, which allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the `content` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Persistent phishing mails
    - Session hijacking
    - Persistent external redirects to malicious sources
    - Application-side manipulation of the affected or connected module context
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Remote attackers with a low-privileged web-application user account can inject malicious script code via the `content` parameter using a POST request to the `create` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs a low-privileged user account to interact with the application
    - Low user interaction is required to execute the exploit.
    - The attacker must be able to access the vulnerable application via the network.
