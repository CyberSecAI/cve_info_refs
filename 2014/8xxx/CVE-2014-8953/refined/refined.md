Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF protection in multiple PHP files within the "Who's Who Script". Specifically, the `adminsave.php` file, among others like `ayarsave.php`, `uyesave.php`, `slaytadd.php`, and `slaytsave.php`, are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The core weakness is the absence of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in the vulnerable files. This allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge or consent.
- **Lack of Session Control:** The exploit specifically highlights that `uyedel.php` and `slaytdel.php` are *not* vulnerable due to the presence of session control, which further emphasizes the absence of such controls as the root cause in vulnerable files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Admin Account Creation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to add a new administrative account by submitting a crafted POST request to `adminsave.php`. This enables the attacker to gain full control of the affected web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website/Link:** The attacker could host a malicious webpage that contains the CSRF exploit code. When a logged-in user visits this page, the exploit will automatically be triggered and submit the crafted request to the vulnerable server.
- **Email or Social Engineering:** The attacker can trick a user into clicking a malicious link, which will then trigger the CSRF exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Victim Authentication:** The attacker requires a user (ideally an administrator) to be authenticated and actively logged into the "Who's Who Script" application.
- **Attacker Control:**  The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious HTML page or code to a logged-in user and make the user visit the malicious page.
