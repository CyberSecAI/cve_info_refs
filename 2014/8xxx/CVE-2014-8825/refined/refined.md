- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Issues existed in `identitysvc` validation of the directory service resolving process, flag handling, and error handling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of directory service responses, flags, and error handling within the `identitysvc` component of the kernel.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could spoof directory service responses to the kernel, leading to privilege escalation or gaining kernel execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, requiring the ability to interact with the directory service and kernel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user with the ability to interact with the system's directory service.
