- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Profile Builder plugin for WordPress does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `assets/misc/fallback-page.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `site_name`, `message`, and `site_url` query string parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a vulnerable page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities by executing within the context of the victim's browser. The CVSS score indicates a potential for confidentiality breach.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (remote), and an attacker can trigger the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit the vulnerability. They only need to be able to send a crafted URL to a victim and have them access it.
