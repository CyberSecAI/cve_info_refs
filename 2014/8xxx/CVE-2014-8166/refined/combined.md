Message-ID: <5510EB20.7020405@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 23 Mar 2015 22:42:08 -0600
From: Kurt Seifried <kseifried@...hat.com>

Subject: CVE-2014-8166 cups: code execution via unescape ANSI escape sequences

So this one is pretty hard to cause exploitation without heavy social
engineering/etc.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1084577>

It was reported that ANSI escape sequences could be added to printer
names in CUPS.  Becaue CUPS has a browsing feature that, when enabled,
allows remote hosts to announce shared printers, a malicious host or
user could send a specially-crafted UDP packet to a CUPS server
announcing an arbitrary printer name that includes ANSI escape
sequences.  Since the CUPS daemon does not remove these characters, a
user on the targeted system could query the printer list (using 'lpstat
-a', for example).  If this were done in a terminal that supported the
ANSI escape sequences (like a terminal with support for color), then
code execution could be possible as the terminal would interpret the
ANSI escape sequences contained in the printer name.

A patch for this is available at
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=916761>

My apologies, this issue has been sitting way to long and is certainly
not worth a long embargo.

I can't wait till I'm done cleaning house of all these embargoed issues
that shouldn't be embargoed. I strongly urge other vendors to do the same.

Which version of the Fedora/Red Hat CUPS package is this patch for? It does not seem to apply cleanly against the one from RawHide:  <<< shlomif@telaviv1:~/progs/Rpms$ cd BUILD/cups-2.0.2/ shlomif@telaviv1:~/progs/Rpms/BUILD/cups-2.0.2$ ls autom4te.cache       CHANGES.txt              desktop           man backend              conf                     doc               monitor berkeley             config.h.in              examples          notifier cgi-bin              config.h.in.lspp         filter            packaging CHANGES-1.0.txt      config-scripts           install-sh        ppdc CHANGES-1.1.txt      configure                INSTALL.txt       README.txt CHANGES-1.2.txt      configure.ac             IPPTOOL.txt       scheduler CHANGES-1.3.txt      configure.ac.lspp        LICENSE.txt       systemv CHANGES-1.4.txt      CREDITS.txt              locale            templates CHANGES-1.5.txt      cups                     Makedefs.in       test CHANGES-1.6.txt      cups-config.in           Makedefs.in.0755  vcnet CHANGES-1.7.txt      cups-config.in.multilib  Makedefs.in.lspp  xcode CHANGES-IPPTOOL.txt  data                     Makefile shlomif@telaviv1:~/progs/Rpms/BUILD/cups-2.0.2$ grep -r process_browse . shlomif@telaviv1:~/progs/Rpms/BUILD/cups-2.0.2$ grep -r 'Resource FQDN' . shlomif@telaviv1:~/progs/Rpms/BUILD/cups-2.0.2$ grep -r 'hptr' . shlomif@telaviv1:~/progs/Rpms/BUILD/cups-2.0.2$  >>>  (all these identifiers appear in the scheduler/dirsvc.c portion of the patch).

In the past, we treated those as security bugs in terminals, not bugs
in the application producing the data that triggers these bugs.
