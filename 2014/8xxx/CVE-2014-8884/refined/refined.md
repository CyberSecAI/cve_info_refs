  "CVE-2014-8884": {
    "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB device driver. A local user with write access to the corresponding device could use this flaw to crash the kernel or, potentially, elevate their privileges.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing limit check in the `ttusbdecfe_dvbs_diseqc_send_master_cmd` function within the TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB driver. Specifically, the driver copies data from the user-supplied command `cmd->msg` into a stack buffer `b` without validating the length.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
      "Missing input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local user with write access to the device can cause a kernel crash or potentially elevate privileges by overwriting the stack.",
    "attack_vector": "A local user with write access to a TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB device plugged into the system can trigger the vulnerability through a crafted IOCTL command.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user with write access to the affected device."
