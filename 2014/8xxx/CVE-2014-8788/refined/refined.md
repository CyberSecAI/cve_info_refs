  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure zip file handling",
    "Path disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Internal paths are leaked. Specifically the path where FileVista is installed ('c:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\FileVista' by default).",
  "Attack vectors": "By attempting to write a zip file to a path where the FileVista user account does not have write access.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of FileVista."
