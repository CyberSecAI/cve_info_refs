Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in the
X.org X server, which may lead to privilege escalation or denial of
service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.4-6+deb7u5.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.16.2.901-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

clients, and has worked with X.Org's security team to analyze, confirm, and fix
these issues.

Ilja's talk at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress (30C3) in Hamburg
last year (*[X Security: it's worse than it looks](http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5499_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312291830_-_x_security_-_ilja_van_sprundel.html)*)
gave a preview of these issues and discussed the general form of many of these,
but did not disclose the exact details of them.

The vulnerabilities could be exploited to cause the X server to access
uninitialized memory or overwrite arbitrary memory in the X server process.
This can cause a denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault), or
could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

How critical these vulnerabilities are to any given installation depends on
whether they run an X server with root privileges or reduced privileges; whether
they run X servers exposed to network clients or limited to local connections;
and whether or not they allow use of the affected protocol extensions,
especially the GLX extension.

The GLX extension to the X Window System allows an X client to send X protocol
to the X server, to request that the X server perform OpenGL rendering on behalf
of the X client. This is known as âGLX indirect renderingâ, as opposed to âGLX
direct renderingâ where the X client submits OpenGL rendering commands directly
to the GPU, bypassing the X server and avoiding the X server code for GLX
protocol handling.

Most GLX indirect rendering implementations share some common ancestry, dating
back to âSample Implementationâ code from Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI), which SGI
originally commercially licensed to other Unix workstation and graphics vendors,
and later released as open source, so those vulnerabilities may affect other
licensees of SGI's code base beyond those running code from the X.Org Foundation
or the XFree86 Project.

The vulnerabilities include:

*denial of service due to unchecked malloc in client authentication*

CVE-2014-8091: In servers built with support for SUN-DES-1 (Secure RPC)
authentication credentials, an unauthenticated client may be able to crash
the X server by sending a connection request specifying values that cause
malloc to fail, causing the authentication routines to attempt to write data
to the returned NULL pointer. Since the request is limited to an unsigned
16-bit integer for the allocation size, it is unlikely to fail unless the
server is severely memory constrained.

Introduced in the initial revision of Secure RPC support in [X11R5](../../../X11R5/) (1991).

*integer overflows calculating memory needs for requests*

These calls do not check that their calculations for how much memory
is needed to handle the client's request have not overflowed, so can
result in out of bounds reads or writes. These calls all occur only
after a client has successfully authenticated itself.

CVE-2014-8092: X11 core protocol requests

Affected functions: ProcPutImage(), GetHosts(), RegionSizeof(),
REQUEST\_FIXED\_SIZE()

Introduced in [X11R1](../../../X11R1/) (1987).

Included in X.Org releases starting in [X11R6.7](../../../Releases/6.7/) (2004).

CVE-2014-8094: DRI2 extension

Affected functions: ProcDRI2GetBuffers()

Introduced in [xorg-server-1.7.0](../../../Server17Branch/) (2009).

*out of bounds access due to not validating length or offset values in requests*

These calls do not check that the lengths and/or indexes sent by the
client are within the bounds specified by the caller or the bounds of
the memory allocated to hold the request read from the client, so could
read or write past the bounds of allocated memory while processing the
request. These calls all occur only after a client has successfully
authenticated itself.

Fixes are also planned to be included in the xorg-server-1.17.0 and
xorg-server-1.16.3 releases.

Other providers of Xserver or GLX implementations based on the same
code base (the X Consortium or X.Org Foundation X sources, or the SGI
GLX sources) will announce the availability of any fixes necessary for
their implementations.

### Mitigation

While the fixes cover all the cases currently known to X.Org, these are
not the first issues in this area and are unlikely to be the last.

Users can reduce their exposure to issues similar to the ones in this
advisory via these methods:

* Configure the X server to prohibit X connections from the network
  by passing the **-nolisten tcp** command line option to the X
  server. Many OS distributions already set this option by default,
  and it will be set by default in the upstream X.Org release
  starting with Xorg 1.17.
* Disable GLX indirect contexts. Some implementations have a
  configuration option for this. In Xorg 1.16 or newer, this can be
  achieved by setting the **-iglx** X server command line option.
  This option will be the default in Xorg 1.17 and later releases.

Consult your operating system's documentation for details on setting X
server command line options, as X servers are started by a variety of
different methods on different platforms (startx, gdm, kdm, xdm, etc.).

### Thanks

X.Org thanks Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive for reporting these issues to our
security team and assisting them in understanding them and evaluating our
fixes, and the following X.Org contributors for developing and reviewing
the fixes, tests, and advisory for these issues, and coordinating the

### unchecked malloc may allow unauthed client to crash Xserver [CVE-2014-8091]

```

authdes_ezdecode() calls malloc() using a length provided by the
connection handshake sent by a newly connected client in order
to authenticate to the server, so should be treated as untrusted.

It didn't check if malloc() failed before writing to the newly
allocated buffer, so could lead to a server crash if the server
fails to allocate memory (up to UINT16_MAX bytes, since the len
field is a CARD16 in the X protocol).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
