```
CVE-2014-8091:
- Root cause: An unchecked malloc call in the authdes_ezdecode() function, which is used for SUN-DES-1 (Secure RPC) authentication, can lead to a crash. The function uses a length provided by the client during the connection handshake, which can be untrusted. If malloc fails, the code attempts to write to the returned NULL pointer.
- Weaknesses: Improper input validation, specifically not checking if malloc returned a valid pointer before using it.
- Impact: Denial of service, specifically a crash of the X server.
- Attack vector: An unauthenticated client can send a connection request with a crafted length value to trigger the malloc failure.
- Required attacker capabilities: The attacker only needs the ability to send a crafted connection request to the X server.

Additional details from the x.org advisory:
- The size of the allocation is limited to a 16-bit unsigned integer.
- The vulnerability was introduced in the initial revision of Secure RPC support in X11R5 (1991).
- The fix is available in git commit 90cc925c5991fcb203f72d00b04419cd754a9b2c.
