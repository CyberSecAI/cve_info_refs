Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of the `dbhost` parameter in the `bpsunlock.php` file within the BulletProof Security WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not check if the database host specified is within an allowed list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The plugin allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary hostname for the database server, which causes the server to make an authentication request to the attacker-controlled host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can obtain the authentication result from the remote server by observing the server's response after attempting to authenticate with the database on the attacker-controlled host.
- **Bypass Access Restrictions:** Through multiple attempts, the attacker could bypass access restrictions to the remote database, potentially gaining unauthorized access.
- **Masquerading Attack Source:** The vulnerable BulletProof Security site appears to be the source of the attack, potentially masking the attacker's true location and activities.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution (If combined with SQL Injection):** If the SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-7959) is also present and not fixed, the attacker can execute arbitrary SQL statements on the remote database server after a successful connection. This amplifies the impact, allowing for data manipulation and further compromise of the remote database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/admin/htaccess/bpsunlock.php`. This request includes the `dbhost` parameter set to an attacker-controlled server.
- **No Host Whitelisting:** The plugin does not validate the `dbhost` parameter against a list of permitted database hosts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Ability to Send POST Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests with specific parameters to the vulnerable script.
- **Database Credentials (Potentially):**  The attacker needs a valid user to exploit the vulnerability. However, they don't necessarily need to have the actual credentials to the targeted database. The vulnerability allows them to probe an external server for authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit for CVE-2014-8749 shows that by manipulating the `dbhost` parameter, an attacker can force the server to perform an authentication request to a remote database. This is a classic example of an SSRF vulnerability.
- The content mentions a potential chained exploit combining SSRF (CVE-2014-8749) and SQL injection (CVE-2014-7959). If the SQL injection vulnerability is also present, the attacker can perform arbitrary SQL queries on the remote server after the successful authentication attempt made using SSRF. This amplifies the potential damage significantly.
- The vulnerability was present in BulletProof Security versions <= 0.51 and was fixed in version 0.51.1.
