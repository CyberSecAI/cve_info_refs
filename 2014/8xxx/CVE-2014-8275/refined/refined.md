Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-8275 from the provided texts:

**Description of the Vulnerability:**

*   OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k doesn't properly enforce constraints on certificate data.

**Root Cause:**

*   Lack of proper enforcement of constraints on certificate data.
*   Non-DER or invalid encodings outside the signed portion of a certificate.

**Vulnerability:**

*   Remote attackers can defeat fingerprint-based certificate blacklist protection.
*   Crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion can alter the certificate's fingerprint without invalidating the signature.

**Affected Software:**

*   This vulnerability affects the OpenSSL library.
*   Multiple HP Products including HP Matrix Operating Environment, HP Version Control Agent (VCA), HP System Management Homepage (SMH), HP Virtual Connect Enterprise Manager SDK

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote attackers craft a certificate with modified data in the unsigned portion.
*   The crafted certificate is then presented to a system using OpenSSL for validation.

**Impact:**

*   Bypass fingerprint-based certificate blacklist protection mechanisms.
*   Unauthorized modification.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Systems using OpenSSL for certificate validation where fingerprint-based blacklisting is in place.
*   openSUSE 13.2, openSUSE 13.1
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade OpenSSL to versions 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0p, 1.0.1k, or later.
*   Disable SSLv2 protocol support and weak EXPORT ciphers.

**Specific Patches/Fixes (where available):**

*   SUSE: Update openssl to 1.0.1k
*   HP-UX: Install OpenSSL A.00.09.08ze or subsequent
*   Red Hat: RHSA-2015:0066, RHSA-2015:0800

**Notes:**

*   Some advisories note that while user applications are directly vulnerable, the libssl component may not be directly exploitable.
*   The issue is related to `crypto/asn1/a_verify.c`, `crypto/dsa/dsa_asn1.c`, `crypto/ecdsa/ecs_vrf.c`, and `crypto/x509/x_all.c` in OpenSSL.
*   Fix included rejecting signatures with nonzero unused bits, checking certificate algorithm consistency, and ensuring DSA/ECDSA signatures use DER.
