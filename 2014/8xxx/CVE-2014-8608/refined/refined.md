Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference within the `K7Sentry.sys` kernel mode driver. This occurs when the driver attempts to write a value to memory address `0x0` after searching for the string "crashme$$" in a filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The driver does not properly validate the result of the string search operation, leading to a write operation at address `0x0` when the search fails to find the string which causes a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System Crash (BSoD):** Exploitation leads to a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD), causing a system crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** Any local user can trigger the vulnerability.
