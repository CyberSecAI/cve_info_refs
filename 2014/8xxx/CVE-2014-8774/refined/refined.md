The provided content is related to CVE-2014-8774.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A malicious user could formulate a link that automatically logs the user into their own account, then redirects the user to a site the attacker controls immediately, exposing the user's CSRF token.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities in the Manager login of MODX Revolution and the Login Extra.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to steal a user's CSRF token, potentially leading to further malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted link that, when clicked, logs the user into their account and redirects them to a site controlled by the attacker. This can be exploited with or without the user entering credentials in the form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a user to click on it.
