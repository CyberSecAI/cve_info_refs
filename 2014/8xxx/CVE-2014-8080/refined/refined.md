Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8080:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to unrestricted entity expansion in the REXML parser of the Ruby programming language. The parser fails to properly limit the allocation of string objects during text node reads from an XML document.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted XML entity expansion leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.
- Failure to limit memory allocation during XML parsing with parameter entities.
- Incomplete fix in a previous patch to prevent "billion laughs" attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by exhausting memory resources of the system, potentially causing a crash.
- Excessive CPU consumption.

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending a specially crafted XML document to a vulnerable application using the REXML parser.
- An attacker could be remote.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send or provide a malicious XML document.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was found to be exploitable even after previous fixes against similar attacks, and this issue was specifically about how parameter entities were handled.
- The fix for this vulnerability was to introduce proper checks against the `REXML::Document.entity_expansion_limit`, as the limit was not applied to parameter entities.
- Some of the content provides workarounds using monkey patching if the system cannot be updated.
- Multiple versions of Ruby are affected, including 1.9, 2.0 and 2.1.
