{
  "cve": "CVE-2014-8101",
  "description": "The X.Org X server is vulnerable to out-of-bounds access due to not validating length or offset values in requests within the RandR extension. Specifically, the functions `SProcRRQueryVersion()`, `SProcRRGetScreenInfo()`, `SProcRRSelectInput()`, and `SProcRRConfigureOutputProperty()` are affected.",
  "affected_functions": [
    "SProcRRQueryVersion()",
    "SProcRRGetScreenInfo()",
    "SProcRRSelectInput()",
    "SProcRRConfigureOutputProperty()"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of lengths and/or indexes sent by the client. This lack of validation allows an attacker to send crafted requests that result in reads or writes beyond the allocated memory boundaries while processing the request.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Out-of-bounds read",
    "Out-of-bounds write"
  ],
  "impact": "This vulnerability could lead to denial of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault) or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Sending crafted requests to the X server using the RandR extension."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to connect to the X server as a client and send X protocol requests. This typically requires successful authentication, although some vulnerabilities may be exploitable without authentication.",
  "more_info": "The issue was introduced in XFree86 4.2.0 (2002) and included in X.Org releases starting in X11R6.7 (2004)."
