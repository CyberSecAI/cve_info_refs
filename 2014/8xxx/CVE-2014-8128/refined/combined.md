- CVE-2014-8128 libtiff: Out-of-bounds Writes in the tiffdither tool
  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2501>

All the crashes were discovered with the help of afl
(<http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/>).

Advisories:
- CVE-2014-8127
  <http://www.conostix.com/pub/adv/CVE-2014-8127-LibTIFF-Out-of-bounds_Reads.txt>
- CVE-2014-8128

- CVE-2014-8129
  <http://www.conostix.com/pub/adv/CVE-2014-8129-LibTIFF-Out-of-bounds_Reads_and_Writes.txt>
- CVE-2014-8130
  <http://www.conostix.com/pub/adv/CVE-2014-8130-LibTIFF-Division_By_Zero.txt>

This was tested on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (amd64) LibTIFF 4.0.3-7ubuntu0.1 .

Last stable LibTIFF source release v4.0.3 is also affected.

Upstream CVS HEAD contains fixes for all bugs except the following:
- CVE-2014-8128 libtiff: Out-of-bounds Write in the thumbnail and tiffcmp tools
  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2499>
- CVE-2014-8127 libtiff: Out-of-bounds Read in the tiffset tool
  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2500>
- CVE-2014-8128 libtiff: Out-of-bounds Writes in the tiffdither tool
  <http://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2501>

Please accept my apologies for the mishandling of this report. I did not
conform to the distros list policy regarding embargo time enforcement
and I failed to notify oss-security before creating bug reports on
public upstream's Bugzilla.
Clearly, notifying the distros list before upstream was not the way to go.
I take full responsibility for this.
