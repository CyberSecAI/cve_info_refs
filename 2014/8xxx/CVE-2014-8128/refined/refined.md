Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-8128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities exist in the `libtiff` library and associated tools.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write in the `thumbnail` tool.
- Out-of-bounds write in the `tiffdither` tool.
- Out-of-bounds write in the `tiffcmp` tool.
- Out-of-bounds write in the `tiff2pdf` tool.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to arbitrary code execution or application crashes, depending on the context and the specific tool being exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted TIFF image file using the vulnerable `libtiff` tools. This could be achieved by an attacker through various means, such as tricking a user into opening a malicious TIFF image, embedding the image on a website, or having the image processed through an automated service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to supply a specially crafted TIFF file that triggers the out-of-bounds write within the vulnerable `libtiff` tools.
- The attacker may not necessarily need direct access to the target system, as the attack could be carried out through user interaction or via automated systems processing user supplied data.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information shows that multiple tools within libtiff were affected.
- The vulnerabilities were discovered using AFL (American Fuzzy Lop)
- Some of the vulnerabilities were fixed in the upstream CVS HEAD, but not all.
- Patches were applied to fix most of these vulnerabilities in a libtiff update to version 4.0.4.
