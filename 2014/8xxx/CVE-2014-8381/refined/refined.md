Root cause of vulnerability:
The Megapolis.Portal Manager CMS is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `dateFrom` and `dateTo` parameters of the `/control/uk/publish/category` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to:
- Stealing of cookies/session tokens
- Defacement of the website
- Redirection to malicious websites
- Other malicious activities by impersonating the user

Attack vectors:
The attack vectors are the `dateFrom` and `dateTo` GET parameters in the following URL:
- `/control/uk/publish/category?dateFrom=[payload]`
- `/control/uk/publish/category?dateTo=[payload]`

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click on it or otherwise inject it into the application.
