Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8321:

**CVE-2014-8321:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** A stack overflow vulnerability was present in the `airodump-ng` tool, specifically within the GPS tracking functionality. The vulnerability occurred because of an incorrect size calculation when receiving data from a GPS daemon socket using the `recv()` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stack overflow:** A buffer overflow on the stack due to an incorrect size calculation in the `recv` function.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The stack overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   A denial of service of the `airodump-ng` tool by crashing the program.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves a malicious or crafted response from a GPS daemon. The vulnerability is triggered when `airodump-ng` receives this malicious data over a socket.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need to have the ability to control or influence the data being sent by a GPS daemon to the machine running the vulnerable `airodump-ng`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content mentions that the fix for this issue was included in the Aircrack-ng 1.2 Release candidate 1.
* The code diff shows that the vulnerability was addressed by changing `sizeof( line ) - 1` to `sizeof( line ) - pos - 1` when calling `recv()`, preventing writing beyond the bounds of the `line` buffer.
