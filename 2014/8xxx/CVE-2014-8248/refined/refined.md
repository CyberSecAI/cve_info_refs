Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection issue caused by insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the `filter` and `parent` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with a non-privileged account could utilize a specially crafted query to access privileged information.
- This could lead to privilege escalation, potentially allowing the attacker to extract the hash of the administrator user.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the `filter` and `parent` parameters of the application, which are not adequately sanitized.
- This requires an authenticated user account, but does not require administrator privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects CA Release Automation (formerly CA LISA Release Automation) versions 4.7.1 Build 413 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was addressed in cumulative hotfix b448 for CA Release Automation 4.7.1 which is version 4.7.1.448 or later.
