  "CVE-2014-8092": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflows in several X11 core protocol requests when calculating memory needs for requests.",

      "Integer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write"

          "Affected functions: ProcPutImage(), GetHosts(), RegionSizeof(), REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE()",
          "ProcPutImage(): The calculations for the total amount of memory the server needs for the pixmap can overflow a 32-bit number, causing out-of-bounds memory writes on 32-bit systems.",
           "GetHosts():  There is a potential integer overflow, if there are lots and lots of hosts (with a combined length of > ~4 gig). This should be possible by repeatedly calling ProcChangeHosts() on 64bit machines with enough memory.",
           "RegionSizeof():  contains several integer overflows if a large length value is passed in.",
           "REQUEST_FIXED_SIZE(): Force use of 64-bit integers when evaluating data provided by clients in 32-bit fields which can overflow when added or multiplied during checks.",
            "GetHosts() saves the pointer to allocated memory in *data, and then wants to bounds-check writes to that region, but was mistakenly using a bare 'data' instead of '*data'."
