{
  "CVE-2014-8769": {
    "description": "tcpdump 3.8 through 4.6.2 might allowed remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from memory or cause a denial of service (packet loss or segmentation fault) via a crafted Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) packet, which triggers an out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The application decoder for the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) protocol in tcpdump fails to perform input validation and performs unsafe out-of-bound accesses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Out-of-bounds memory access"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service (packet loss or segmentation fault) or obtain sensitive information from memory. The application might not crash, but perform out-of-bounds accesses and output/leak larger amounts of invalid data.",
      "attack_vector": "Sending a crafted Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) packet to a system running a vulnerable version of tcpdump.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target system.",
	   "affected_versions": "Versions 3.8 through 4.6.2 of tcpdump are affected."
