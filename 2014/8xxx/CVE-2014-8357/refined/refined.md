Vulnerability: Admin Password Disclosure
CVE ID: CVE-2014-8357
Root cause: The ZHONE router uses Base64 encoding to store user passwords in a backup file.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:  Insecure storage of passwords, specifically the use of Base64 encoding without proper protection.
Impact of exploitation:  A low-privileged user can obtain all user passwords for the Web Administrative Portal.
Attack vectors: A low-privileged user can access the backup settings file by browsing to http://<Router URL>/backupsettings.html, extracting the session key from the HTML source, and then using the session key to browse to http://<Router URL>/backupsettings.conf?action=getConfig&sessionKey=<Enter Session Key Here>, which returns all user account passwords.
Required attacker capabilities/position: A low-privileged user with access to the router's web administrative portal.
