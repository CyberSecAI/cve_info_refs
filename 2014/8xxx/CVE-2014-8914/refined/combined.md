How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Error description

* ```
  In IBM Process Portal, if the fix for APAR [JR49924](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR49924) is installed,
  you can set the start page to a dashboard page by clicking the
  '+' in the upper-left corner of the page, which subsequently
  turns into a check mark symbol to reflect that the page is the
  start page. However, when you log out of Process Portal and then
  log back in the page displayed is the Work > My Tasks page, not
  the page you previously selected to be the start page.

  PRODUCTS AFFECTED:
  IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced
  IBM BPM Standard
  IBM BPM Express

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  You can configure the start page for a user from the Process
  Admin Console:

  1.  Go to User Management > Bulk User Attribute Assignment >
  Portal Default Page.
  2.  Select the user and enter the URL for the dashboard, which
  is displayed in the browser's address bar when you go to the
  dashboard in Process Portal.

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  The fix for APAR [JR49924](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1JR49924) added the ability to escape double
  slash ("//") sequences in dashboard URLs so that the URLs could
  be properly included as parameters in HTTP requests. However,
  the code that saves the URL for a start page that you configure
  saves the escaped URL in your user profile.  As a result, the
  next time you log in to Process Portal, the start page URL in
  your user profile is not recognized, resulting in the Work > My
  Tasks page being displayed instead of the configured start page.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix for IBM BPM V8.0.1.3 and V8.5.0.1 is available that
  ensures that the unescaped dashboard URL is always saved in your
  user profile when you set the start page to a dashboard page,
  allowing the dashboard page to be displayed when you log in to
  Process Portal.

  On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search
  for JR52103:

  1. Select IBM Business Process Manager with your edition from
  the product selector, the installed version to the fix pack
  level, and your platform, and then click Continue.
  2. Select APAR or SPR, enter JR52103, and click Continue.

  When you download fix packages, ensure that you also download
  the readme file for each fix. Review each readme file for
  additional installation instructions and information about the
  fix.
