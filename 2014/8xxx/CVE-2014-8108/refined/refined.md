There are no known instances of this problem being exploited in the wild.\nKnown vulnerable:\n=================\nSubversion HTTPD servers 1.7.0 through 1.7.18 (inclusive)\nSubversion HTTPD servers 1.8.0 through 1.8.10 (inclusive)\nKnown fixed:\n============\nSubversion 1.7.19\nSubversion 1.8.11\nDetails:\n========\nSubversion 1.7.0 and newer added new protocol variant to the HTTP support.\nOne of the changes in this new protocol was that the client no longer had to generate the UUID by which transactions would be referred to. However, there were circumstances where clients needed to provide their own names for transactions and so it has support for virtual transaction names. These transaction names are then mapped to the servers internal transaction id much as was done in the old protocol. New special URIs were provided to allow the client to access the transactions by these virtual transaction names.\nMaking a request for a URI that refers to a non-existant virtual transaction name results in the lookup for the internal transaction id to be NULL.\nSubsequent uses of the transaction id do not properly validate that the id is valid and result in a SEGFAULT.\nSeverity:\n=========\nCVSSv2 Base Score: 5.0\nCVSSv2 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P\nWe consider this to be a medium risk vulnerability. Repositories which allow for anonymous reads will be vulnerable without authentication.\nUnfortunately, no special configuration is required and all mod_dav_svn servers that support the new protocol variant are vulnerable.\nA remote attacker may be able to crash a Subversion server. Many Apache servers will respawn the listener processes, but a determined attacker will be able to crash these processes as they appear, denying service to legitimate users. Servers using threaded MPMs will close the connection on other clients being served by the same process that services the request from the attacker. In either case there is an increased processing impact of restarting a process and the cost of per process caches being lost.\nRecommendations:\n================\nWe recommend all users to upgrade to Subversion 1.8.11. Users of Subversion 1.7.x or 1.8.x who are unable to upgrade may apply the included patch.\nNew Subversion packages can be found at:\nhttp://subversion.apache.org/packages.html\nNo known workarounds are available.\nReferences:\n===========\nCVE-2014-8108 (Subversion)\nReported by:\n============\nEvgeny Kotkov, VisualSVN",
