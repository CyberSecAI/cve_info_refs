# [ImperialViolet](https://www.imperialviolet.org)

### [The POODLE bites again](/2014/12/08/poodleagain.html) (08 Dec 2014)

October's [POODLE attack](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html) affected CBC-mode cipher suites in SSLv3 due to SSLv3's under-specification of the contents of the CBC padding bytes. Since SSLv3 didn't say what the padding bytes should be, implementations couldn't check them and that opened SSLv3 up to an oracle attack.

We're done pretty well at killing off SSLv3 in response to that. Chrome 39 (released Nov 18th) removed fallback to SSLv3 and Chrome 40 [is scheduled](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/security-dev/Vnhy9aKM_l4) to remove SSLv3 completely. Firefox 34 (released Dec 1st) has already [removed SSLv3 support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/34.0/releasenotes/).

We're removing SSLv3 in favour of TLS because TLS fully specifies the contents of the padding bytes and thus stops the attack. However, TLS's padding is a *subset* of SSLv3's padding so, technically, you could use an SSLv3 decoding function with TLS and it would still work fine. It wouldn't check the padding bytes but that wouldn't cause any problems in normal operation. However, if an SSLv3 decoding function was used with TLS, then the POODLE attack would work, even against TLS connections.

This was noted by, at least, Brian Smith on the TLS list ([[1](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14058.html)][[2](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14072.html)]) and I was sufficiently cynical to assume that there were probably more instances of this than the old versions of NSS that Brian cited, and so wrote a scanner for the issue.

Unfortunately, I found a number of major sites that had this problem. At least one of whom I had good enough contacts at to quickly find that they used an F5 device to terminate connections. I contacted F5 on October 21st and they started working on a fix. Yngve Pettersen also [independently found](https://vivaldi.net/blogs/entry/not-out-of-the-woods-yet-there-are-more-poodles) this issue and contacted me about it around this time.

F5 reported that some of the affected sites weren't customers of theirs, which meant that there was (at least) a second vendor with the same issue. After more digging, I found that some A10 devices also have this problem. I emailed a number of contacts at A10 on October 30th but sadly didn't get a reply from any of them. It wasn't until November 13th that I found the right person at A10 to deal with this.

F5 and A10 have posted patches for their products (F5's are [here](https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/15000/800/sol15882.html) and A10's are [here](https://www.a10networks.com/support-axseries/downloads/downloads.php) and they have an advisory [here](https://www.a10networks.com/support/advisories/A10-RapidResponse_CVE-2014-8730.pdf)). I'm not completely sure that I've found every affected vendor but, now that this issue is public, any other affected products should quickly come to light. (Citrix devices have an odd behaviour in this area in that they'll accept padding bytes that are all zeros, but not random padding. That's unexpected but I can't make an attack out of it.)

(**Update**: since posting this, it appears that products from Fortinet, [Cisco](http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityNotice/CVE-2014-8730), IBM ([WebSphere](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692552), [Domino](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21693142), [Tivoli](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21692802)) and [Juniper](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=TSB16579&actp=RSS) may also be affected.)

Ivan Ristić has added a test for this issue to his excellent scanner at [SSLLabs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/). Affected sites will have their grade set to F and will report “This server is vulnerable to the POODLE attack against TLS servers”.

This seems like a good moment to reiterate that *everything* less than TLS 1.2 with an AEAD cipher suite is cryptographically broken. An IETF [draft to prohibit RC4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-prohibiting-rc4/) is in Last Call at the moment but it would be wrong to believe that RC4 is uniquely bad. While RC4 is fundamentally broken and no implementation can save it, attacks against MtE-CBC ciphers have repeatedly been shown to be far more practical. Thankfully, TLS 1.2 support is [about to hit](https://www.trustworthyinternet.org/ssl-pulse/) 50% at the time of writing.

CVE-2014-8730 was reserved by F5 from the MITRE CNA, but at the time
of assignment, we were not aware of its potential applicability to
other designs or implementations.

>I have not checked if any implementations are vulnerable, but could MITRE

>vulnerable, or if they plan to assign another CVE id?

The short answer is that based on what I've seen, each affected
implementation might need its own CVE ID.

If this is a fundamental design issue within TLS - that is, if any
implementation that strictly complies with the protocol will also have
this vulnerability - then CVE-2014-8730 is appropriate.

But, if implementations can avoid this issue while also strictly
conforming with the protocol, then separate CVEs per implementation
would be needed.  Currently, we treat "behavior that is undefined or
unspecified by the specification" as an implementation issue, since an
implementation could have avoided a vulnerability while still
complying with the specification.

The ImperialViolet disclosure says: "TLS's padding is a subset of
SSLv3's padding so, technically, you could use an SSLv3 decoding
function with TLS and it would still work fine. It wouldn't check the
padding bytes but that wouldn't cause any problems in normal
operation. However, if an SSLv3 decoding function was used with TLS,
then the POODLE attack would work, even against TLS connections."

This strongly suggests an implementation issue, since it appears that a
TLS-compliant implementation could avoid a padding check without violating
the TLS spec.  Further, as described discussed in the URLs below, a TLS
implementation "SHOULD" check the padding bytes, but it is not required to
do so (i.e., there is no "MUST" requirement):

<https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14058.html>
<https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/tls/current/msg14072.html>

So, it seems to me that separate CVE identifiers would be needed for
such implementations.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
