Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of an SSLv3-style padding check (or lack thereof) in TLS implementations. While TLS specifies padding bytes, some implementations were using SSLv3 decoding functions, which do not enforce checks on the padding bytes.  This allowed a variation of the POODLE attack, which exploits the under-specification of padding in SSLv3, to work against TLS connections when they used an SSLv3-style padding implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Padding Validation:** The core weakness is that some TLS implementations did not properly validate the padding bytes in CBC-mode cipher suites. They were using an SSLv3-style padding check (or lack thereof), which is more permissive, instead of strictly enforcing the TLS padding rules.
*   **Use of SSLv3 Decoding Functions:** Reusing SSLv3 decoding logic in TLS processing was a design flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The POODLE attack is a padding oracle attack, allowing an attacker to decrypt portions of the encrypted data. This means that the attacker could potentially access sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate TLS traffic between the client and the vulnerable server. This attack is not local, meaning a remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** A classic MitM attack would be used to inject and manipulate packets to carry out the attack. The attacker would be positioned between a client and the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable server.
*   **Traffic Manipulation:**  The attacker must be able to modify the intercepted traffic by injecting and altering packets to trigger the padding oracle.
*   **Knowledge of Cryptography:** The attacker must understand the mechanics of the POODLE attack, how padding works in CBC mode and be able to leverage this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   Several vendors were affected including F5, A10, IBM (WebSphere, Domino, Tivoli, Connect:Direct for Windows/UNIX, Communications Server for Windows), Fortinet, Cisco, and Juniper.
*   The vulnerability can be detected by looking for TLS implementations that use SSLv3-style padding logic with TLS. Tools such as SSLLabs can detect and report this issue.
*   The vulnerability is not in the TLS protocol itself, but rather in the implementation of TLS padding. This is why a fix requires patching the vulnerable systems and software.
*   The fix involves implementing proper TLS padding validation according to the specifications.
*   The vulnerability is a variation of the original POODLE attack, adapted to TLS due to improper implementation of the padding.
*   The issue highlights the importance of strict compliance with protocol specifications and avoiding the reuse of legacy code that may contain security weaknesses.
