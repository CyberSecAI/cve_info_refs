Guideline 4: Summarize extracted information.
Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause across the sources is consistent: a race condition within the Linux kernel's dcache implementation, particularly in the `d_walk` function, which can lead to a deadlock due to improper handling of the `rename_lock` and the presence of killed dentries. The core issue is that while traversing the directory tree, the code might attempt to reacquire the `rename_lock` without releasing it if a dentry is deleted by a concurrent operation, or if `d_child.next` has been altered, as d_child was also used for the d_rcu struct, which is freed when a dentry is being destroyed.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The identified weaknesses include:
  *   A deadlock condition due to recursive locking on rename_lock (dcache.c).
    * Improper handling of dentry lifecycle during tree walks.
    *   Incorrect assumption about dentry state when rename_lock was held.
    *   Use of  `d_child` struct member, which overlaps with d_rcu and can lead to corruption
    *   Missing handling of dentry_kill within d_walk.
    *   Improper check of if a restart was needed.
Impact of exploitation: The impact of successful exploitation is a denial-of-service, typically resulting in a system hang or crash due to a kernel-level deadlock. In some cases the system could become completely unresponsive.
Attack vectors: The primary attack vector is local, where an unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability via a crafted application that performs certain file system operations, particularly involving directory renames or deletions.
Required attacker capabilities/position: Local, unprivileged user with the ability to execute code on the target system, and cause filesystem operations.

Summary of Response:
The documents provided are generally related to CVE-2014-8559, which was caused by a deadlock condition due to improper handling of `rename_lock` in the Linux kernel’s `d_walk` function. The documents discuss the root cause, impact, and patches for this vulnerability across different Linux distributions including Red Hat, SUSE and Ubuntu. They confirm a local, unprivileged user can exploit this for a denial of service. They also mention that in the vulnerable code, the `d_child` struct member, which shares memory with `d_rcu` would be freed by `dentry_kill()`. The fix involves changing to the use of `d_alias` instead for RCU freeing, using `__list_del()` instead of `list_del()`, and implementing appropriate checks to avoid retries or deadlocks.
