- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Format string vulnerability in the `wscanhw` executable and a stack overflow vulnerability in the `wscansw` executable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Format string and stack overflow vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Disruption of service due to increased CPU usage and application crashes.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities exist in the CIT scanner component executables (`wscanhw` and `wscansw`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document states these are remote vulnerabilities, but does not specify how an attacker would trigger the vulnerability.
