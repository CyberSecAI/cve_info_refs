Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8596:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection found in the PHP-Fusion CMS (Content Management System).
- It stems from the lack of proper input sanitization of the `status` parameter in the `members.php` page, and the `submit_id` parameter in `submissions.php` in the administration panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The application does not directly display the results of the injected SQL code, but the attacker can infer the results based on the application's response, making it a blind injection.
- Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize the `status` and `submit_id` parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can perform a variety of malicious actions, including:
  - Public Defacement
  - Confidential data leakage
  - Database server compromise
  - Potential compromise of client systems

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends HTTP requests to the vulnerable `members.php` and `submissions.php` pages within the administration panel.
- The malicious SQL code is injected through the `status` and `submit_id` GET parameters.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as administrator to access the vulnerable pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the PHP-Fusion CMS.
- The attacker can use HTTP protocol version 1.0 or higher.
- The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax and Blind SQL Injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable parameters: `status` in `/phpfusion/files/administration/members.php` and `submit_id` in `/phpfusion/files/administration/submissions.php`.
- Example of exploitation:
  - `/phpfusion/files/administration/members.php?aid=99ad64700ec4ce10&sortby=all&status=0' AND substr(@@version,1,1)='5` (True request example)
  - `/phpfusion/files/administration/members.php?aid=99ad64700ec4ce10&sortby=all&status=0' AND substr(@@version,1,1)='4` (False request example)
  - `/PHP-Fusion/files/administration/submissions.php?action=2&aid=9b23a9871adc75cd&submit_id=1[SQL Injection]&t=n`
  - `/PHP-Fusion/files/administration/members.php?aid=9b23a9871adc75cd&status=4[SQL Injection]`
- The vulnerability affects PHP-Fusion version 7.02.07 and prior.
