Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8184:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `findTable()` function within the `liblouis` library. The vulnerability was introduced in commit `26ca8619`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The `findTable()` function copies data to a fixed-size buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.
- The initial fix using `strncpy` was incomplete, as `strncpy` does not guarantee null termination if the source string is longer than the destination buffer, potentially leading to further issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause a crash in applications using `liblouis` (e.g., Orca).
- Potential arbitrary code execution: Overwriting the stack may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted input file: An attacker creates a specially crafted file that, when processed by `liblouis`, triggers the buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to an application using `liblouis`. This could be via user interaction or through a service processing such a file.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was present in older versions of the `liblouis` library, specifically a version that was outdated in the Red Hat package.
- The function was refactored in a later version of the library (commit `dc97ef791a4fae9da11592c79f9f79e010596e0c`), which addressed the issue.
- The initial fix with `strncpy` was not sufficient because it doesn't handle null termination when the source string exceeds the buffer size, a subsequent patch was created to address the issue properly.
- The incomplete fix was assigned CVE-2017-15101.
- Red Hat released security updates to address both CVE-2014-8184 and the incomplete fix under RHSA-2017:3111 and RHSA-2017:3384, respectively.
