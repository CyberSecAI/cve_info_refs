  "CVE-2014-8583": {
    "description": "mod_wsgi, when creating a daemon process group, does not properly handle dropping group privileges. A malicious application could possibly use this issue to cause a local privilege escalation when using daemon mode.",
    "root_cause": "Improper error handling when dropping group privileges during daemon process creation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "mod_wsgi does not properly handle errors when attempting to drop group privileges.",
      "Failure to restart daemon process when group privileges can't be dropped, leading to the process running with incorrect group privileges.",
      "Off-by-one error in supplementary group limit checking."
    ],
    "impact": "Context-dependent attackers could escalate privileges due to the improper handling of group privileges. A malicious application could possibly use this issue to cause a local privilege escalation when using daemon mode.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by a malicious application when using mod_wsgi in daemon mode."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A user must have the ability to run a WSGI application configured to use the daemon mode in mod_wsgi and be able to trigger the vulnerable code path."
