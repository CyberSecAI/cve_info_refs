  "CVE-2014-8767": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "CVE_ID": "CVE-2014-8767",
      "CNA": "mitre"
    },
    "Description": "The application decoder for the OLSR protocol fails to perform external input validation and performs insufficient checking on length computations leading to an unsafe decrement and underflow in the function olsr_print (const u_char *pptr, u_int length, int is_ipv6). In this function msg_len is extracted from the input without sufficient checks and subtracted sizeof(struct olsr_msg4) which leads to an underflow of msg_tlen which is used to call olsr_print_neighbor() which will crash.",
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Insufficient input validation and length check in the `olsr_print` function of tcpdump.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Integer underflow vulnerability due to unsafe length calculations.",
        "Lack of proper input validation leading to out-of-bounds memory access."
       ],
      "Impact": "Denial of service (application crash) due to a segmentation fault, and potentially, arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack Vectors": "A malformed OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing) packet sent over the network.",
      "Required Capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a host running tcpdump in verbose mode, monitoring the network interface."
    },
    "Affected Versions": "tcpdump versions 3.9.6 through 4.6.2.",
    "Fix Information": "The vulnerability is fixed in tcpdump version 4.7.0."
