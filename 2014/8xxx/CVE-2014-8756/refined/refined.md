- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `GetVOLHeader` method in the `NcrCtl4.NcrNet.1` control allows writing null bytes to an arbitrary memory address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary write vulnerability via the `GetVOLHeader` method.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to lure the target into visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host or deliver a malicious web page or file, but does not need prior authentication or access. User interaction is required by the target.
