openSUSE Security Update: Security update for dbus-1, dbus-1-x11
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0300-1
Rating: moderate
References: #916343
Cross-References: CVE-2015-0245
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
dbus-1, dbus-1-x11 were updated to version 1.8.16 to fix one security
issue.
This update fixes the following security issue:
- CVE-2015-0245: Do not allow non-uid-0 processes to send forged
ActivationFailure messages. On Linux systems with systemd activation,
this would allow a local denial of service (bnc#916343).
These additional security hardenings are included:
- Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment from uids
other than the uid of the dbus-daemon. If a system service installs
unsafe security policy rules that allow arbitrary method calls (such as
CVE-2014-8148) then this prevents memory consumption and possible
privilege escalation via UpdateActivationEnvironment.
- Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment or the Stats interface
on object paths other than /org/freedesktop/DBus. Some system services
install unsafe security policy rules that allow arbitrary method calls
to any destination, method and interface with a specified object path.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-150=1
- openSUSE 13.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-150=1
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=912016#c0)  Victor Pereira   2015-01-07 09:50:42 UTC  ``` X.org has traditionally been suid root so that users could utilize "startx" (or similar scripts) to start X from the command line as a user.  X.org does not sanitize the environment when starting, which means it will be aware of, and pass along, environment variables.  When X.org is using the DBus backend, specifically versions 1.5.x or newer, the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is passed along to libdbus.  The DBUS system address can take a unixexec (Executed Subprocess on UNIX) transport [1] which allows one to specify a binary to execute and arguments to pass to it.  Because the DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS environment variable is not scrubbed by X, this environment variable is passed along to libdbus, and it specifies the address of the system message bus.  A malicious local user could use this, in conjunction with the unixexec transport, to execute arbitrary code as root (because /usr/bin/Xorg is suid root).  [1] <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#transports-exec>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for reporting this issue. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=912016#c1)  Victor Pereira   2015-01-07 09:51:09 UTC  ``` fixed ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=912016#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2015-01-07 15:34:52 UTC  ```   *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 697105](show_bug.cgi?id=697105 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2012-3524: libdbus using getenv() in suids") *** ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=912016#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2015-01-23 09:05:38 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2015:0111-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.

Subject: CVE-2014-8148: midgard-core configures D-Bus system bus to be insecure

Type of vulnerability: CWE-284 Improper Access Control
Exploitable by: local users
Impact: could allow arbitrary code execution as root (dependent on
installed D-Bus system services)
Reporter: Simon McVittie, Collabora Ltd.
Upstream notified: 2014-12-19

Midgard2 is an open source content repository for data-intensive web and
desktop applications.

While checking Debian for incorrect/dangerous D-Bus security policy
files (found in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/*.conf) I found this access control
rule in midgard2-common/10.05.7.1-2, part of the upstream project
midgard-core:

<policy context="default">               <==== "applies to everyone"
  <allow own="org.midgardproject" />     <==== probably undesired
  <allow send_type="method_call"/>       <==== definitely bad
  <allow send_type="signal" />           <==== not good either
</policy>

This is analogous to an overly permissive "chmod": it allows any process
on the system bus to send any method call or signal to any other process
on the system bus, including those that are normally forbidden either
explicitly or via the system bus' documented default-deny policy. Some
D-Bus system services perform additional authorization checks, either
via Polkit/PolicyKit or internally, but many services rely on the system
bus to apply their intended security model.

For instance, depending on installed software, this vulnerability could
allow unprivileged local users to:

* invoke Avahi's SetHostName() method
* communicate with bluetooth devices using BlueZ
* install printer drivers using system-config-printer
* run NetworkManager "dispatcher" scripts
* ...

It seems likely that at least one of these services can be used for
arbitrary code execution as root, making this a severe vulnerability.

Regards,
    S

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for dbus-1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0111-1
Rating: moderate
References: #912016
Cross-References: CVE-2012-3524 CVE-2014-8148
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update fixes the following security issues:
\* CVE-2014-8148:
- Do not allow calls to UpdateActivationEnvironment from uids
other than the uid of the dbus-daemon. If a system service installs
unsafe security policy rules that allow arbitrary method calls (such as
CVE-2014-8148) then this prevents memory consumption and possible
privilege escalation via UpdateActivationEnvironment.
\* CVE-2012-3524: Don't access environment variables (bnc#912016)
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-50
- openSUSE 13.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-50
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".
