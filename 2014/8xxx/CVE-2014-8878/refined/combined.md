| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=340312#c0)  Mike Schneider    2014-10-24 18:40:36 UTC  ``` When composing a new message, selecting "encrypt message" will cause attachments to be also encrypted. This is the correct, expected behavior.  However, if encryption is not manually selected and a message comprising attachments is sent AND the option "automatic encryption" ("Nachrichten möglichst automatisch verschlüsseln")is selected and the key of the receiver is known, a pop-up is displayed, asking whether you want to encrypt the mail. This is also correct.  HOWEVER: if you select yes, kmail will only encrypt the message body, not the attachments and will send out the unencrypted attachment without asking further questions.   Expected behaviour: attachments are also encrypted  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. In the settings, under security, select "automatic encryption" ("Nachrichten möglichst automatisch verschlüsseln") 2. Compose a mail to a sender having a known gpg key 3. Attach a file to the message 4. send the massage, when asked whether you want to encrypt the message, select yes  Actual Results:   Message body will be encrypted, attachment will be sent in clear , defeating the purpose of sending encrypted mails  Expected Results:   Message body ant attachments are encrypted ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=340312#c1)  Samir Nassar    2014-12-02 14:55:56 UTC  ``` I just confirmed this with KMail2 4.14.3 on Arch linux. I sent a message and was able to read the attachment in the clear from my mail client. If confirmed further, this is a serious problem. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=340312#c2)  Laurent Montel    2014-12-03 12:21:20 UTC  ``` I confirm it. I look at it. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=340312#c3)  Laurent Montel    2014-12-03 21:57:11 UTC  ``` Git commit 626c857eb30c0533a4de7836ee843caaa8c00a26 by Montel Laurent.

Fixed in <https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kdepim.git&a=commit&h=626c857eb30c0533a4de7836ee843caaa8c00a26>
which ended up in the 4.14.4 upstream release.

Marking 4.14.5-1 as fixed as the next following Debian upload.

Use CVE-2014-8878.

Other comments (probably irrelevant):

This general type of issue has been included in CVE before: see
CVE-2014-5369.

We feel that it is conceivable that this kmail behavior had been
intentional. Encrypting attachments to arbitrary recipients, simply
because a PGP key is known, has a usability problem. Some mail systems
automatically and silently remove attachments that can't be scanned
for malware (e.g., when the pre-encryption content type of the
attachment is one that can have malware). This has, in some sense, a
risk of "data corruption" because the meaning of a message can be
vastly different if the attachment doesn't arrive. If the sender
explicitly selects the "encrypt message" option, then that's a very
strong signal that encryption is required, and kmail did encrypt
attachments in that case. The "automatic encryption" implementation
might have made a different tradeoff between security and usability.
But, probably not. We decided to assign a CVE ID anyway because the
commit refers to the change as a bug fix, because there was apparently
no documentation of an intentional tradeoff, and because we're unaware
of any widespread acceptance of a need to avoid encrypted attachments
in some cases.
