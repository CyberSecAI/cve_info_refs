Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2014-8356:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The administrative web application of the Zhone router does not enforce authorization on the server side. Access control is implemented solely through client-side JavaScript, which restricts the display of available functions based on user privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  The vulnerability stems from the lack of server-side authorization checks. The application relies on JavaScript to hide or show elements based on user roles, but it doesn't actually prevent low-privileged users from accessing administrative functions by directly manipulating the HTTP requests or JavaScript responses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can gain full administrative access to the router's web interface. This allows them to bypass intended access restrictions and perform actions they would normally be prohibited from doing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** By using a proxy tool like Burp Suite, an attacker can modify the JavaScript responses from the server to include administrative functions.
*   **Client-Side Manipulation:** The attacker can alter the client-side JavaScript to remove or modify the restrictions, thereby accessing restricted functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged User Account:** The attacker needs a valid low-privileged user account on the Zhone router.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to access its web interface.
*   **Proxy Tool:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify web requests, a proxy tool like Burp Suite is used.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is demonstrated by using a proxy tool to intercept the `menuBcm.js` response and replacing "admin" with the user's low-privileged username.
*   This vulnerability is present in Zhone ZNID GPON 2426A (and other 24xx, 24xxA, 42xx, 42xxA, 26xx, and 28xx series models) with versions less than S3.0.501.
