Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-8990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `default-rsyncssh.lua` script in Lsyncd did not properly sanitize filenames before using them in shell commands, specifically when using the `-rsyncssh` option.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  Filenames containing shell metacharacters (like backticks, quotes, dollar signs, etc.) could be used to inject arbitrary commands into the `mv` command executed by Lsyncd.
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The initial attempt to sanitize filenames using `gsub` was incomplete and could be bypassed. It also introduced a Lua 5.2 incompatibility causing a denial-of-service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the target host with the privileges of the user running `lsyncd`.
*   **Denial of Service:** By crafting filenames with certain characters, an attacker could crash the service or cause synchronization to fail.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to create or rename files in directories monitored by Lsyncd.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when Lsyncd processes a "Move" event related to a file containing malicious characters in the filename.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs write access to the local directories being monitored by Lsyncd.
*   The attacker can be local or remote depending on where the monitored directories are located.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code used `mv` command to move files during synchronization. The filenames were passed directly to the shell, allowing for command injection.
*   The initial fix attempt involved escaping characters like `"` , "`" and `%$`  using `gsub`, but it was incomplete.
*   The final fix involved properly sanitizing the file paths before passing them to the `mv` command by using `'` and escaping any `'` within the path by `\'"\'"\'`.
*   The vulnerability affected versions of Lsyncd prior to 2.1.6.
*   The issue was present in both local and remote scenarios when using rsync over ssh (`-rsyncssh`).
