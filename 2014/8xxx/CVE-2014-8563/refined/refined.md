  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-8563",
    "description": "Improper Input Validation vulnerability in Zimbra's IMAP/POP3 service STARTTLS implementation.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the IMAP/POP3 service's failure to properly validate plaintext commands received after a STARTTLS command but before the TLS handshake is complete.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject plaintext commands before TLS is fully established, potentially gaining unauthorized access or control.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send specially crafted plaintext commands to the IMAP/POP3 service after the STARTTLS command but before TLS negotiation completes.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection with the IMAP/POP3 service and send commands.",
    "patches": [
          "Created org.apache.mina.filter.ssl.ZimbraSslFilter",
          "Implemented NioConnection.isTlsStartedIfNecessary() to check when the SSL handshake is complete.",
          "Modified NioHandlerDispatcher.messageReceived() to ignore plaintext messages received before TLS handshake completion and log a warning."
