## QPR Portal contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#546340

Original Release Date: 2015-01-23 | Last Revised: 2015-01-23

---

### Overview

QPR Portal versions 2014.1.1 and older contain reflected and stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and versions 2012.2.0 and older contain an insecure direct object reference vulnerability.

### Description

| [**CWE-79**](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**  QPR Portal versions 2014.1.1 and older contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2014-8266) affecting the title and body fields of the note creation page. A reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (CVE-2014-8267) affects the RID parameter.[**CWE-639**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/639.html)**: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key** - CVE-2014-8268An unauthorized user of QPR Portal versions 2012.2.0 or older may be able to modify or remove notes belonging to another user by directly referencing associated identifiers. This issue does not affect version 2012.2.1 or later. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session or perform unauthorized operations on other users' notes. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**The vendor has released QPR Portal 2014.1.1 [Hotfix 402288](http://files.qpr.com/hotfix/QPR_2014_1_1_Generic_402288.zip) to address the cross-site scripting vulnerabilities. The vendor recommends first installing [QPR Suite 2014.1.1](http://files.qpr.com/releases/QPR_Suite_2014.1.1/QPR_Suite_2014.1.1.zip) and then applying the hotfix. QPR Portal [version 2012.2.1](http://files.qpr.com/releases/QPR_Suite_2012.2.1/QPR_Suite_2012.2.1.zip) and later are not affected by the authorization bypass vulnerability.If you are unable to upgrade, please consider the following workaround. |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
