Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8351:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `info.php` file of the CookieViz application. The application uses the `$_GET["domain"]` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `domain` parameter passed via the GET method to `info.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration: Access and extraction of sensitive data from the database.
    - Data modification: Alteration or deletion of data in the database.
    - Privilege escalation: Manipulation of database user permissions.
    - Code execution: In this specific case, the attacker can use `load_file()` to read local files and `INTO OUTFILE` to write arbitrary content to files on the server. This is possible due to the usage of the root MySQL account with file privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** By writing malicious PHP code into the webserver's directory, an attacker could gain remote code execution on the server itself.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `info.php` endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `domain` parameter.
- The vulnerable `info.php` script is part of a WAMP (Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP) environment bundled with the CookieViz application. The tool can be launched from a browser, and the SQL injection can be triggered via an iframe with a crafted src attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the CookieViz application, which is typically exposed to a user's local network.
- **Basic HTTP/SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to interact with a malicious website (or a site with an iframe) that loads the vulnerable page with a crafted URL. The user runs the WAMP server locally for this attack to be viable.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The `mysql_real_escape_string` function was used to try to sanitize input, but it was used improperly.
- The bundled WAMP environment runs MySQL with the root account, granting file system privileges that exacerbate the impact of the SQL injection.
- The `info.php` file retrieves the `domain` parameter from the URL, which is then used in the SQL query without sanitization.
- The exploit demonstrated the ability to read arbitrary local files (e.g., `php.ini`) and to write PHP files into the web server's directory.
- The vulnerability is present in CookieViz before version 1.0.1.
