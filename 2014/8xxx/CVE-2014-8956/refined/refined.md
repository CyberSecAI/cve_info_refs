Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `K7Sentry.sys` kernel mode driver of K7 Computing products. The driver's IOCTL handler for `0x9500259C` has an out-of-bounds write vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds Write:** The driver copies data from user-provided input to a fixed-size buffer in the driver's `.data` section. It does not check the size of the input against the buffer size, allowing an attacker to write past the buffer boundary.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The function checks if the input buffer size is less than 4, which is insufficient. It doesn't check if the input size exceeds the destination buffer size (0x800 bytes)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with kernel-level privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows complete control of the affected system.
- **Overwrite other data:** By overflowing the buffer, arbitrary data and function pointers used by other driver functions can be overwritten.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally.
- **IOCTL Call:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specific IOCTL call (`0x9500259C`) to the `K7Sentry.sys` driver.
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker must provide a specially crafted input to the IOCTL call with a length exceeding the buffer size (0x800 bytes).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Ability to Interact with Device Driver:** The attacker must be able to send IOCTL commands to the `K7Sentry.sys` driver.
- **Knowledge of IOCTL Code and Driver Vulnerability:** The attacker must know the specific IOCTL code and the nature of the vulnerability to craft the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function copies data byte by byte until it encounters a null byte. This is similar to an inlined `strcpy` implementation but lacks bounds checking.
- The fixed version is 12.8.0.119, while affected versions include 12.8.0.110 and likely earlier versions.
