# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2014-8956 - Privilege Escalation In K7 Computing Multiple Products [K7Sentry.sys]

---

*From*: Portcullis Advisories <advisories () portcullis-security com>

*Date*: Wed, 10 Dec 2014 16:06:11 +0000

```
Vulnerability title: Privilege Escalation In K7 Computing Multiple Products [K7Sentry.sys]
CVE: CVE-2014-8956
Vendor: K7 Computing
Product: Multiple Products [K7Sentry.sys]
Affected version: 12.8.0.110
Fixed version: 12.8.0.119
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou
Details:

Latest, and possibly earlier versions of K7Sentry.sys kernel mode driver, also named as the 'K7AV Sentry DeviceDriver',
suffers from a Out-of-bounds Write condition that can be exploited locally by an attacker in order to execute code with
kernel privileges. Successful exploitation of this bug results into vertical privilege escalation.

Technical Details:

The function handling IOCTL 0x9500259C does not validate the size of the input before it starts copying the data into a
statically allocated array inside the driver module itself in the .data section at address K7Sentry + 0xdaec8.

b9d05da0 837e0404 cmp dword ptr [esi+4],4 <--- check if input buffer size < 4
b9d05da4 7233 jb K7Sentry+0x9dd9
b9d05da6 8b4608 mov eax,dword ptr [esi+8] <--- get address of input buffer
b9d05da9 85c0 test eax,eax <--- validate there is an input buffer allocated
b9d05dab 742c je K7Sentry+0x9dd9 (b9d05dd9)
b9d05dad bac86eddb9 mov edx,offset K7Sentry+0xdaec8 <--- get address of array in .data section
b9d05db2 2bd0 sub edx,eax
b9d05db4 8a08 mov cl,byte ptr [eax] <--- read each byte from input
b9d05db6 880c02 mov byte ptr [edx+eax],cl <--- write each byte to array
b9d05db9 40 inc eax <--- increment index
b9d05dba 84c9 test cl,cl <--- check for '/x00'
b9d05dbc 75f6 jne K7Sentry+0x9db4 <--- if '/x00' not found loop again
b9d05dbe 837e0c04 cmp dword ptr [esi+0Ch],4
b9d05dc2 7212 jb K7Sentry+0x9dd6
b9d05dc4 8b4610 mov eax,dword ptr [esi+10h]
b9d05dc7 8b4e14 mov ecx,dword ptr [esi+14h]
b9d05dca c70001000000 mov dword ptr [eax],1
b9d05dd0 c70104000000 mov dword ptr [ecx],4
b9d05dd6 33c0 xor eax,eax
b9d05dd8 c3 ret
b9d05dd9 b8010000c0 mov eax,0C0000001h
b9d05dde c3 ret

As shown above, this function will keep copying data to an array allocated in .data section of the driver which has a
size of 0x800 bytes, until it finds a NULL byte which defines the end of an ASCII string, just like an inlined strcpy
function. Since the function does not validate further the size of the data to copy against the size of the array, we
are able to keep copying data that we fully control and overwrite other data and function pointers used by other
functions.
