  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The NCP dissector in Wireshark has multiple issues, specifically related to handling malformed packets. One issue involves an uninitialized buffer, and another involves insufficient bounds checking before writing to a buffer, which can lead to crashes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uninitialized variable usage",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted packet or trace file can cause Wireshark to crash, leading to a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting a malformed packet onto the network.",
      "Convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to either send a malformed packet to a network where wireshark is monitoring, or convince a wireshark user to open a specially crafted capture file."
