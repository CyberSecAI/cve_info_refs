```

Good morning,

The 1.12.9, 2.2.8, and 2.3.3 releases of the Zend Framework fix two issues:

<http://framework.zend.com/blog/zend-framework-1-12-9-2-2-8-and-2-3-3-released.html>

<http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-05>

<http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-06>

Could CVEs please be assigned?

```
(For the ZF2014-05 advisory, the discussion in
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/09/2> may be helpful
if needed.)
```

Thanks,

### Security

## Security Advisory: ZF2014-06

# ZF2014-06: SQL injection vector when manually quoting values for sqlsrv extension, using null byte

The `sqlsrv` PHP extension, which provides the ability to connect to Microsoft
SQL Server from PHP, does not provide a built-in quoting mechanism for manually
quoting values to pass via SQL queries; developers are encouraged to use
prepared statements. Zend Framework provides quoting mechanisms via Zend
Framework 1's `Zend_Db_Adapter_Sqlsrv` and Zend Framework 2's
`Zend\Db\Adapter\Platform\SqlServer` classes; these traditionally use the
recommended "double single quote" (`''`) as quoting delimiters.

SQL Server treats null bytes in a query as a string terminator, allowing an
attacker to add arbitrary SQL following a null byte, and thus create a SQL
injection.

Developers using the relevant `PDO_Sqlsrv` adapter in any version of Zend
Framework are *not* vulnerable to this attack, as PDO provides a native quoting
mechanism that prevents the attack vector.

## Action Taken

When quoting values for SQL server, we now pass them to PHP's addcslashes function to sanitize and properly quote null bytes:

```
$value = addcslashes($value, "\000\032");

```

This action quotes null bytes, preventing SQL injection vectors.

The following releases contain the fixes:

* Zend Framework 1.12.9
* Zend Framework 2.2.8
* Zend Framework 2.3.3

If you are using an affected version of PHP, and utilizing the sqlsrv PHP extensio within Zend Framework, we highly recommend upgrading immediately.

## Other Information

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and working with us to help protect its users:

* Jonas Sandström, who discovered and reported the issue against the
  `Zend_Db_Adapter_Sqlsrv` component of ZF1;
* Matthew Weier O'Phinney, who provided the patch.
