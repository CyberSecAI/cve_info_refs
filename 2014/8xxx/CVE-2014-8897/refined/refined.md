- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website, potentially leading to theft of cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into clicking it. The vulnerability is triggered when a user clicks the crafted URL. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, but they would need to have the URL clicked by a user.
