  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-8631",
      "root_cause": "Chrome objects, when protected by Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and passed as native interfaces, could expose normally protected objects to native methods accessible to web content.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) when passed as native interfaces."
      ],
      "impact": "Web content could access DOM objects intended to be chrome-only.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Passing COW objects as native interfaces to methods exposed to web content."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to pass a crafted object that bypasses the intended security restrictions.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is described as having a 'pretty low chance' of exploitation. It requires a content-accessible native method that accepts an interface type (not marked as a built-in class) which could be satisfied by a content-accessible chrome object and then manipulates the wrapped chrome object in a harmful way."
    },
     {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-8632",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs during structured cloning when security wrappers are removed during traversal. Initially, objects appear to have a limited set of properties due to XrayWrappers, but later, after the wrappers are removed, a broader set of properties becomes available. These are then stored without further validation, bypassing security protections.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper unwrapping of security wrappers during structured clone operations.",
        "Lack of re-validation after removing security wrappers."
      ],
       "impact": "Web content could access DOM objects that are intended to be chrome-only, potentially leading to security breaches.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating content objects to have specific properties to trigger the bypass in structured cloning.",
           "Exploiting object properties exposed during the removal of XrayWrappers."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate objects in a way that triggers the structured cloning and to control properties of the object to obtain access to the normally protected chrome-only properties.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability involves the use of `CheckedUnwrap` during the Structured Clone algorithm. Chrome manipulates content Objects or Arrays with XrayWrappers to filter tricky properties. The vulnerability occurs when these wrappers are stripped, and properties that appeared absent from the Xray side may be accessed via getters."
