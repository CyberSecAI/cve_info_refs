Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8168:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   A missing authorization flaw in Red Hat Satellite allowed local users to access the embedded MongoDB database without proper authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper access controls for the MongoDB instance used by Red Hat Satellite. This allows any local user on the Satellite server to connect to the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** A local user could modify or delete the `pulp_database`, leading to corruption of the Satellite database.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  The exploitation of this flaw can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
*   **System Availability**: Deleting the database leads to data corruption, making the system unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access to the Red Hat Satellite server. This means that the attacker must already have some form of shell access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid local user account on the Red Hat Satellite server.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker would need knowledge of how to access the MongoDB instance.

**Summary**
A local user on a Red Hat Satellite server can bypass access controls and connect directly to the embedded MongoDB database. This allows them to modify or delete the database content, causing data corruption and potentially rendering the system unusable.
