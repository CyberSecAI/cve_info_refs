Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the `reportViewAction.jsp` file of Progress OpenEdge 11.2. The application doesn't properly sanitize the `selection` parameter, allowing directory traversal sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw. By using sequences like `../`, an attacker can navigate the file system outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially including sensitive configuration files, application code, and user data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP GET request. The attacker manipulates the `selection` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of Application Structure:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL path (`/report/reportViewAction.jsp`) and the vulnerable parameter (`selection`).
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Request:** The attacker must be able to construct a valid HTTP GET request with the malicious directory traversal sequence.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable URL: `http://target_ip:9090/report/reportViewAction.jsp`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `selection`
- Example Payload: `selection=..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fwindows%2fwin.ini` or `selection=../../../../../../../..//../../windows/win.ini`
