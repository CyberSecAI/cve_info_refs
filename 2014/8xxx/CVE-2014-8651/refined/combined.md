KDE Project Security Advisory
=============================
Title: kde-workspace, plasma-desktop: privilege escalation
Risk Rating: Medium
CVE: CVE-2014-8651
Platforms: All
Versions: kde-workspace < 4.11.14, plasma-desktop < 5.1.1
Author: David Edmundson davidedmundson@kde.org
Date: 06 November 2014
Overview
========
KDE workspace configuration module for setting the date and time has a helper program
which runs as root for performing actions. This is secured with polkit.
This helper takes the name of the ntp utility to run as an argument. This allows a hacker
to run any arbitrary command as root under the guise of updating the time.
Impact
======
An application can gain root priveledges from an admin user with either misleading information
or no interaction.
On some systems the user will be shown a prompt to change the time. However, if the system has
policykit-desktop-privileges installed, the datetime helper will be invoked by an admin user
without any prompts.
Workaround
==========
Add a polkit rule to disable the org.kde.kcontrol.kcmclock.save action.
Solution
========
For kde-workspace 4 upgrade kde-workspace to 4.11.14 once released or apply the following patch:
https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kde-workspace/repository/diff?rev=54d0bfb5effff9c8cf60da890b7728cbe36a454e&rev\_to=fd2aa9deed44fad6107625ad7360157fea7296f6
For plasma-desktop 5 upgrade to plasma-desktop 5.1.1 once release or apply the following patch:
https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/workspace/plasma-desktop/repository/diff?rev\_to=683b66889b8abbeec82eedcbb1c9ff08c06e9582&rev=58bb376fb9ffb2ecb9ce0a89a0a312bfa091bd3f
Credits
=======
Thanks to David Edmundson for finding and fixing the issue

# KDE Systemsettings: Privilege escalation — GLSA **201512-12**

Data validation in KDE Systemsettings could lead to local privilege
escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **kde-base/systemsettings** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.11.13-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.11.13-r1** |

### Background

KDE workspace configuration module for setting the date and time has a
helper program
which runs as root for performing actions.

### Description

KDE Systemsettings fails to properly validate user input before passing
it as argument in context of higher privilege.

### Impact

A local attacker could gain privileges via a crafted ntpUtility (ntp
utility name) argument.

### Workaround

Add a polkit rule to disable the org.kde.kcontrol.kcmclock.save action.

### Resolution

All KDE Systemsettings users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=kde-base/systemsettings-4.11.13-r1"

```

Subject: Privilege Escalation via KDE Clock KCM polkit helper

Hello, I found a security issue in KDE which under Ubuntu and some other
distros allows a program to run arbitrary processes as root from an admin
user without any prompts.

I need a CVE number.  I understand you are an authority that can provide
this.

Let me know if I can help provide anything else.

KDE Project Security Advisory
=============================

Title:          kde-workspace:
Risk Rating:    Medium (??)
CVE: ???
Platforms:      All
Versions:       kde-workspace < 4.14.3
Author:         David Edmundson <davidedmundson@....org>
Date:           4 November 2014

Overview
========

KDE workspace configuration module for setting the date and time has a
helper program
which runs as root for performing actions. This is secured with polkit.

This helper takes the name of the ntp utility to run as an argument. This
allows a hacker
to run any arbitrary command as root under the guise of updating the time.

Impact
======

An application can gain root priveledges from an admin user with either
misleading information
or no interaction.

On some systems the user will be shown a prompt to change the time.
However, if the system has
policykit-desktop-privileges installed, the datetime helper will be invoked
by an admin user
without any prompts.

Workaround
==========

Add a polkit rule to disable the org.kde.kcontrol.kcmclock.save action

Solution
========

Upgrade kde-desktop to 4.14.3 once released or apply the following patch:
<https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/120977/>

Credits
=======

Thanks to David Edmundson for finding and fixing the issue
