Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8651:

**Root Cause:**
The KDE Clock KCM (KDE Control Module) policykit helper, responsible for setting the date and time, did not properly sanitize input. Specifically, it took the name of the NTP utility to run as an argument without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient input validation:** The helper program did not check the provided NTP utility argument.
- **Privilege escalation:** By providing a malicious command as the ntp utility argument, a user-level process could trick the helper program, running with elevated (root) privileges via polkit, into executing arbitrary commands.
- **Reliance on user-provided input for privileged operations:** The design allowed an untrusted user-provided string to directly impact a privileged command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege escalation:** An attacker could gain root privileges from an administrative user.
- **Arbitrary command execution:** An attacker could execute any command with root privileges, potentially leading to system compromise.
- **System takeover:**  Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The attack requires local access to the system.
- **Manipulated Input:** A user-level application with malicious intent can craft a specific string as the 'ntp utility' argument.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User access:** An attacker needs to have a user account on the vulnerable system.
- **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code within a user session.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:**  The attacker needs to know that the `ntpUtility` argument isn't being properly sanitized.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `kde-workspace` versions prior to 4.11.14 and `plasma-desktop` versions prior to 5.1.1.
- On systems with `policykit-desktop-privileges` installed, the helper can be invoked by an admin user without prompting, making the exploit easier to execute.
- The fix involves validating the input to ensure that only the allowed NTP utilities can be executed. The patch removes `ntpUtility` as an argument passed to the datetime helper.
- A workaround includes creating a polkit rule to disable the `org.kde.kcontrol.kcmclock.save` action, which would prevent the vulnerable code from being executed.
