{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a shortened URL, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can steal the administrator's cookies, allowing them to log in to the admin panel and gain control of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious payload into the URL shortening input field. When the administrator views the shortened URL in the admin panel, the malicious code executes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create a new URL to shorten using the vulnerable input field. The administrator needs to log into the admin panel to trigger the exploit."
