- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Linksys SMART WiFi firmware allows unauthenticated remote attackers to send crafted HTTP POST requests to `/JNAP/`, leading to execution of arbitrary JNAP calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Exposure (CWE-200). Specifically, the router's JNAP interface is exposed without proper access control, enabling unauthenticated access to sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Depending on the called JNAP action, an attacker can read or modify sensitive information on the router. This may lead to complete compromise of the router and potential network access.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, unauthenticated attackers can send specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/JNAP/` endpoint on the router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to reach the router's web interface via HTTP or HTTPS. This is possible due to the router exposing multiple ports (10080 and 52000 are specifically mentioned) to the WAN by default.
