CVE-2014-8958: The phpMyAdmin application before 4.0.10.6, 4.1.x before 4.1.14.7, and 4.2.x before 4.2.12 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via crafted database, table, or column names, or crafted ENUM values, or a crafted pma_fontsize cookie.
```

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input within phpMyAdmin. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize:
*   Database, table, and column names, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript when these names are displayed in the table browse page.
*   ENUM values when displayed in table print view and zoom search pages
*   The `pma_fontsize` cookie which is used to set the font size on the home page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where an attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This happens because the application renders unsanitized input directly into the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser in the context of the phpMyAdmin application.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
*   **Defacement/Malicious Actions:** The injected scripts could be used to deface the application, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform unauthorized actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Database/Table/Column Names:** An attacker with the ability to create or modify database objects (databases, tables, columns) can inject XSS payloads by crafting malicious names.
*   **Crafted ENUM Values:** An attacker able to inject a malicious ENUM value in table definitions can inject XSS payloads in the table print view and zoom search pages.
*   **Crafted `pma_fontsize` Cookie:** An attacker can forge a `pma_fontsize` cookie with malicious script to achieve XSS in the home page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated phpMyAdmin user to exploit the vulnerabilities related to crafted database/table/column names and ENUM values. This is because the vulnerable pages are protected by a token, preventing access by non-logged-in users.
*   **Cookie Forgery:** For the `pma_fontsize` XSS vulnerability, the attacker needs to forge the `pma_fontsize` cookie.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability related to the font size requires forgery of the `pma_fontsize` cookie as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required pages.
*   The severity is considered non-critical because it requires the attacker to be logged into phpMyAdmin
*   Patches involve sanitizing the user-provided input using the `htmlspecialchars` function
*   The fix for the XSS vulnerability through the `pma_fontsize` cookie involves sanitizing the cookie's value before using it.
