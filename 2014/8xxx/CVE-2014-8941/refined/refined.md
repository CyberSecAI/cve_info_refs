The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities in Lexiglot, a translation platform for PHP projects. One of these vulnerabilities is related to CVE-2014-8941.

**CVE-2014-8941**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when querying the database.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerabilities
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application. This can potentially lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion of data, and in some cases, complete compromise of the underlying database server and the server the web application resides.
*   **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET requests to `/admin.php?page=users` and HTTP POST requests to `/admin.php?page=history` with crafted parameters. The example uses the `from_id` parameter in GET request and `user_id`, `language`, `project`, `status`, `limit` parameters in POST request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges are mentioned, but access to the admin interface is implied for some of the attack vectors.
