## Multiple Dell iDRAC IPMI v1.5 implementations use insufficiently random session ID values

#### Vulnerability Note VU#843044

Original Release Date: 2014-12-18 | Last Revised: 2014-12-18

---

### Overview

The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) v1.5 implementations in multiple Dell iDRAC releases are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection due to use of insufficiently random session ID values.

### Description

| [**CWE-330**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)**: Use of Insufficiently Random Values** - CVE-2014-8272  The IPMI v1.5 implementations in multiple Dell iDRAC releases, including versions of iDRAC6 modular/monolithic and iDRAC7, are vulnerable to arbitrary command injection due to use of predictable and limited session ID values. Session IDs are assigned incrementally rather than randomly, enabling an authenticated user to predict subsequent session IDs based on his own session. However, due to the small pool of possible session ID values, brute force guessing attacks are viable and authentication is not necessary.Dell has issued the following statement:*The legacy nature of the IPMI 1.5 protocol exposes several weaknesses in the overall design and implementation. These are:*       - *Use of an insecure (unencrypted) channel for communication.* - *Poor password management including limited password length.* - *Limited session management capability.*  *These weaknesses are inherent in the overall design and implementation of the protocol, therefore support for the IPMI 1.5 version of the protocol has been permanently removed. This means that it will not be possible to reactivate or enable it in an operational setting.*Dell's full statement can be viewed in Vendor Information below. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject arbitrary commands into a privileged session. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Dell has released the following updates that completely remove IPMI v1.5 code:     + iDRAC6 modular – [version 3.65](http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=61W8X) + iDRAC6 monolithic - [version 1.98](http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=78M0V) + iDRAC7 – [version 1.57.57](http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/Drivers/DriversDetails?driverId=XH6FX)  Note that removing IPMI v1.5 is a violation of the [IPMI v2.0 specification](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/servers/ipmi/second-gen-interface-spec-v2-rev1-4.html), section 13.4, which requires backwards compatibility with IPMI v1.5. Other than requiring users to adopt IPMI v2.0 at the exclusion of the insecure IPMI v1.5, no additional impact of the violation is known.**Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Dell advises the following:*DRAC’s are intended to be on a separate management network; they are not designed nor intended to be placed on or connected to the internet. Doing so could expose the connected system to security and other risks for which Dell is not responsible.**Along with locating DRACs on a separate management subnet, users should isolate the management subnet/vLAN with technologies such as firewalls, and limit access to the subnet/vLAN to authorized server administrators.* |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| The following versions of Dell iDRAC are affected: iDRAC6 modular, versions 3.60 and below; iDRAC6 monolithic, versions 1.97 and below; iDRAC7, versions 1.56.55 and below. |

### Vendor Statement

**Dell Response to VU #843044** **–** **Arbitrary Command Injection for IPMI 1.5 [05 December 2014]**

**Summary**

Due to the vulnerabilities inherent in IPMI 1.5, Dell has removed IPMI 1.5 code completely. Dell recommends upgrading to the following firmware release or greater to eliminate all such vulnerabilities related to the IPMI 1.5 protocol:

- iDRAC6 modular – version 3.65
- iDRAC6 monolithic - version 1.98
- iDRAC7 – version 1.57.57
- iDRAC8 – N/A - IPMI 1.5 not present in iDRAC8 firmware

The legacy nature of the IPMI 1.5 protocol exposes several weaknesses in the overall design and implementation. These are:

- Use of an insecure (unencrypted) channel for communication.
- Poor password management including limited password length.
- Limited session management capability.

These weaknesses are inherent in the overall design and implementation of the protocol, therefore support for the IPMI 1.5 version of the protocol has been permanently removed. This means that it will not be possible to reactivate or enable it in an operational setting.

**Dell Best Practices**

Dell advises the following:

DRAC’s are intended to be on a separate management network; they are not designed nor intended to be placed on or connected to the internet. Doing so could expose the connected system to security and other risks for which Dell is not responsible.
Along with locating DRACs on a separate management subnet, users should isolate the management subnet/vLAN with technologies such as firewalls, and limit access to the subnet/vLAN to authorized server administrators.

Dell would like to thank Mr. Yong Chuan Koh for reporting this vulnerability by following responsible disclosure process and we appreciate his patience and cooperation through the period he interacted with Dell on discussions related to this vulnerability.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
