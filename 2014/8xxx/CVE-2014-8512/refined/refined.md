- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Atx45.ocx` control within Schneider Electric's ProClima software can be initialized and called by malicious scripts, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection (CWE-77) and Buffer Overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation via malicious scripts that initialize and call the vulnerable `Atx45.ocx` control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and requires a low level of skill to exploit the vulnerability.
