- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a DLL hijacking issue in Corel PDF Fusion. When a file associated with Corel PDF Fusion is opened, the application searches for the "quserex.dll" in the same directory as the opened file, without proper path control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427). The application loads a DLL from an untrusted location (the same directory as the document being opened).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution within the context of the Corel PDF Fusion application. An attacker can place a malicious DLL named "quserex.dll" in the same directory as a Corel PDF Fusion file. When the user opens this file, the malicious DLL will be loaded and executed.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation. The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL file in the same directory as a file associated with Corel PDF Fusion. Then the user needs to open the crafted file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have write access to a directory where a user is likely to open a Corel PDF Fusion file from. They also need to craft a malicious DLL with the correct filename.
