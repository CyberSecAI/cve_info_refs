Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8764:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the improper handling of null bytes within user credentials (username and password) when authenticating against an LDAP server, specifically Microsoft's Active Directory. DokuWiki's LDAP authentication mechanism did not sanitize or validate user-provided credentials, allowing null bytes to be passed to the underlying LDAP library.
*   The vulnerability stems from how PHP's `ldap_bind` function interacts with the OpenLDAP C library. The PHP function passes the username and password as C-style null-terminated strings by passing a pointer to the PHP string's value data in memory, allowing for null byte injection.  The OpenLDAP C `ldap_bind` function interprets the null byte as a string terminator, effectively truncating the username/password at the first null byte.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Byte Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the injection of null bytes (`\0` or `%00`) into the username and password fields during authentication.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Due to the null byte truncation, an attacker can bypass authentication.
    *   By providing a username and password that *both* start with a null byte, the LDAP bind operation results in an anonymous bind, meaning no authentication is performed.
    *  This allows an attacker to bypass the intended authentication checks and gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A successful exploit would grant an attacker complete access to the DokuWiki instance, as if they were a valid user, despite not knowing any valid user's actual credentials.
*   **Data Breach / Manipulation:** Once authenticated (or in this case, bypassing authentication), the attacker can then perform actions based on the permissions associated with the user/group they have effectively logged in as.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Manipulation of Login Parameters:** An attacker could inject null bytes into username/password fields by intercepting and modifying the HTTP request (e.g., using a proxy tool or a custom script).
*   **Form Input Modification:** By directly modifying the input fields of a web form, and sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could send a username and password starting with a null byte

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the DokuWiki instance.
*   **Knowledge of LDAP Setup:** The attacker must target DokuWiki instances that are configured to use LDAP (specifically Active Directory) for authentication.
*   **Ability to Inject Null Bytes:** An attacker needs the capability to inject a null byte within the username and password fields of the login request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is specific to DokuWiki installations that use Active Directory for LDAP authentication and are running on a PHP version before the fix was applied to PHP (versions <= 5.5.11, <= 5.4.27).
*   The vulnerability is related to but distinct from other authentication bypass issues, as it specifically exploits how null bytes are handled in the authentication process.
