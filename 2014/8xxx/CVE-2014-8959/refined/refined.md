**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the geometry type parameter within the GIS editor feature of phpMyAdmin. This allows for the inclusion of arbitrary local files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The primary weakness is the ability to include and execute local files by manipulating the geometry type parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By including and executing arbitrary local files, an attacker can gain control of the server, leading to a severe security compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Geometry Type Parameter: The attack vector involves providing a malicious value for the geometry type parameter within the GIS editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of phpMyAdmin to access the vulnerable GIS editor feature.
- Network Access: Network access to the phpMyAdmin installation is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is considered serious.
- This issue affects phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.6), 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.7), and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.12).
- Patches are available in the provided commits, which introduce proper validation to prevent arbitrary local file inclusion.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-661 (Improper Handling of Parameters) and CWE-98 (Improper Control of Filename for Include/Require Statement)
