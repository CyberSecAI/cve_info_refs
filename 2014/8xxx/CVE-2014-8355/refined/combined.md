# CVE-2014-8355: ImageMagick - Out-of-bounds read / heap overflow in PCX parser

ImageMagick is vulnerable to an out of bounds read / heap Overflow in the function ReadPCXImage in the file pcx.c. GraphicsMagick, which is a fork of ImageMagick, is also affected.

The issue has been found with the help of Address Sanitizer and the fuzzing tool zzuf.

### Solution

ImageMagick has released the fixed version 6.8.9-9 (also including fixes for other out of bounds issues).

GraphicsMagick has fixed the issue in its repository, no release yet.

### Timeline
