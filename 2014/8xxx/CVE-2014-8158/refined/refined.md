Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-8158:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Unrestricted stack memory usage in the `jpc_qmfb.c` file within the JasPer library. Specifically, the code uses variable length arrays (VLAs) where sizes are derived from the codestream data, without proper validation, allowing for negative numbers or excessive sizes, leading to uncontrolled memory access on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of sizes when declaring local variables in stack memory, potentially leading to a stack overflow due to excessively large or negative sizes.
*   **Unrestricted Stack Memory Use:** The allocation of stack memory depends on the input codestream data, without sufficient checks, making the stack susceptible to manipulation by malicious files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** A specially crafted JPEG 2000 file can cause applications using JasPer to crash due to stack corruption or access of invalid memory locations.
*  **Arbitrary code execution:** Possibly, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted JPEG 2000 Files:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JPEG 2000 image file that, when opened by an application using JasPer, triggers the flawed stack memory handling.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to get a user to process the malicious JPEG 2000 image file using an application linked against the vulnerable JasPer library. No specific network position or other prior access is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Some sources indicate that the issue arises due to missing bounds checks and incorrect component number checks.
*   The vulnerability was reported by pyddeh and recognized by oCERT.
*   Red Hat has rated this as having an Important security impact.
*   The fix involves removing or avoiding the use of variable length arrays (VLAs) or using fixed sized stack allocations.
