{
  "CVE-2014-8122": {
    "description": "It was discovered that under specific conditions the conversation state information stored in a thread-local variable in JBoss Weld was not sanitized correctly when the conversation ended. This could lead to a race condition that could potentially expose sensitive information from a previous conversation to the current conversation.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The conversation state information, stored in a thread-local variable, was not sanitized correctly when a conversation ended.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper cleanup of thread-local storage",
           "Race condition during context deactivation"
        ],
        "impact": "Potential exposure of sensitive information from a previous conversation to a new conversation due to race conditions.",
        "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered when a conversation ends improperly due to exceptions. This occurs when the `ConversationNamingScheme.PARAMETER_NAME` is removed during request processing.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to induce an error in a web application that improperly manages ConversationContexts and simultaneously initiate a new conversation in the same thread."
