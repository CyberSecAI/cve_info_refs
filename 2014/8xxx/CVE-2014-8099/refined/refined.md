Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of lengths within the XVideo extension's swapped procedure calls. Specifically, the X server does not check if the lengths specified in client requests are within the bounds of allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unvalidated Lengths:** The X server fails to validate the lengths provided in requests by clients to XVideo extension functions. This allows a malicious or compromised client to specify arbitrary lengths.
- **Out-of-bounds Access:** Due to unvalidated lengths, the server can read from or write to memory outside the allocated buffers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Out-of-bounds memory access can cause the X server to crash due to segmentation faults.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If a malicious client carefully crafts a request that overflows into an exploitable region of memory, they could potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the X server process. This is considered a privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious X Client:** A malicious or compromised X client can send specially crafted requests to the X server, exploiting the lack of length validation.
- **Networked X Clients**: If X server is exposed to network clients, remote attackers may also be able to exploit these vulnerabilities, though many distributions now disable this by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to send requests to the X server. This means they need to have a client that is authenticated or allowed to connect to the X server.
- The attacker needs to craft a request that exploits the length validation flaw. This will require knowledge of the affected functions and memory management within the X server.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is specifically in the swapped procedure calls of the XVideo extension. This suggests that it affects functions that handle byte-swapping of data for different architectures.

**Affected Functions (according to the x.org advisory):**

SProcXvQueryExtension(), SProcXvQueryAdaptors(), SProcXvQueryEncodings(), SProcXvGrabPort(), SProcXvUngrabPort(), SProcXvPutVideo(), SProcXvPutStill(), SProcXvGetVideo(),
SProcXvGetStill(), SProcXvPutImage(), SProcXvShmPutImage(), SProcXvSelectVideoNotify(), SProcXvSelectPortNotify(), SProcXvStopVideo(), SProcXvSetPortAttribute(),
SProcXvGetPortAttribute(), SProcXvQueryBestSize(), SProcXvQueryPortAttributes(), SProcXvQueryImageAttributes(), SProcXvListImageFormats()

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was introduced in XFree86 4.0.0 (2000) and has been present in X.Org releases since X11R6.7 (2004).
- Patches are available as git commits.
- Mitigation steps include disabling network connections to the X server and disabling GLX indirect contexts.
