- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper validation of user-supplied input leading to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could send a malformed HTTP request by persuading an authenticated user to visit a malicious website, potentially leading to cross-site scripting attacks, web cache poisoning and other malicious activities. The document explicitly mentions the ability to force a user to log out.
- **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker can persuade an authenticated user to visit a malicious web site to send a malformed HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and persuade an authenticated user of the vulnerable application to visit it.
