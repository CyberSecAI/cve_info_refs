Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8705:

**Vulnerability:** Remote File Include (RFI)

**Root Cause:** The `editInplace.php` file in Wonder CMS 2014 directly includes a file specified in the `hook` parameter from the user request without any sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unvalidated Input:** The `$_REQUEST['hook']` parameter is directly used in an `include()` statement without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Remote File Inclusion:** The code allows the inclusion of files from remote locations by specifying a URL in the `hook` parameter, leading to Remote File Inclusion vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could include a malicious PHP file from a remote server, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the vulnerable Wonder CMS instance. This could result in complete server compromise.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:**  An attacker could gain access to the server's file system to steal sensitive data, modify files, or deface the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request to the `editInplace.php` file with the `hook` parameter set to a URL pointing to a malicious PHP file under attacker's control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Wonder CMS server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the application.
