- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the use of the `extract` function with the `$_GET` variable, which allows an attacker to control variables used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability. The script passes unsanitized user-supplied input from the `$_GET` array into the extract function which then allows for manipulation of a subsequent SQL query.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL into the database query. This can lead to information disclosure, data modification, or other malicious activities depending on the database privileges. In the provided proof of concept, an attacker is able to obtain table names from the information_schema database.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote. The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `sl-xml.php` script with specific parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authorization and can be an anonymous user. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They do not need to know the names of database tables in order to perform a basic SQL injection attack, but do need to know the name of the Store Locator table in order to use the provided proof of concept.
