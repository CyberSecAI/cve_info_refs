Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-8701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the storage of unsalted MD5 password hashes in a publicly accessible file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Password Disclosure:** Unsalted MD5 password hashes are stored in the `/files/password` file. This allows anyone who can access the file to view the password hashes.
- **Insecure Storage:** Storing password hashes without a salt makes them vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to user accounts by obtaining the unsalted MD5 password hashes and then cracking them. This could result in complete takeover of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct File Access:** An attacker can directly access the `/files/password` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to access files on the web server. This can happen if the webserver is misconfigured and exposes this directory.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content offers more detail than a typical CVE description by explaining the exact location and nature of the password vulnerability, which involves directly viewing the `/files/password` file. This vulnerability is further exacerbated by the fact that the MD5 hashes are unsalted, making them easier to crack. The content also lists other vulnerabilities in Wonder CMS 2014, including Full Path Disclosure, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Local File Inclusion (LFI), although these are associated with other CVE IDs.
