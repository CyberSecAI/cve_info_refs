- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow when parsing the `ip_address` parameter. The application copies strings to the stack without checking the length, leading to the overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, or crash the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by loading a malformed HTML file locally. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious HTML file on the local system and then convince a user to open the file using the vulnerable application.
