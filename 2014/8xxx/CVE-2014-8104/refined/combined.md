## Binary packages built by this source

[openvpn](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/openvpn):
virtual private network daemon

OpenVPN is an application to securely tunnel IP networks over a

 single UDP or TCP port. It can be used to access remote sites, make

 secure point-to-point connections, enhance wireless security, etc.

 .

 OpenVPN uses all of the encryption, authentication, and certification

 features provided by the OpenSSL library (any cipher, key size, or

 HMAC digest).

 .

 OpenVPN may use static, pre-shared keys or TLS-based dynamic key exchange. It

 also supports VPNs with dynamic endpoints (DHCP or dial-up clients), tunnels

 over NAT or connection-oriented stateful firewalls (such as Linux's iptables).
