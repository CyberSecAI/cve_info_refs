Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from OpenVPN's improper handling of control channel packets that are shorter than 4 bytes in length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation on the length of control channel packets. Specifically, the server-side was not checking for a minimum size of 4 bytes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the OpenVPN server to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is carried out by sending a malformed control channel packet that is less than 4 bytes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated client of the OpenVPN server. This means they must have valid credentials to connect to the VPN.

**Additional Notes:**
- Patches were created to drop too-short control channel packets rather than asserting out in `ssl.c`, preventing the crash.
- Multiple distributions have released updates for this vulnerability, including Debian, Ubuntu, Mageia, and openSUSE.
- The vulnerability is present in various OpenVPN versions, including 2.2.1, 2.3.2, and 2.3.4
