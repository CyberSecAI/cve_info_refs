{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking in the Xen hypervisor's acceleration support for the `REP MOVS` instruction when accessing memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) emulated within the hypervisor. The hypervisor incorrectly assumes that the entire range accessed by `REP MOVS` is managed by the same hypervisor sub-component.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient bounds checking",
      "Incorrect assumption about memory range handling"
     ],
    "impact": "A malicious or buggy HVM guest can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service, crashing the host system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A privileged HVM guest user can trigger the flaw by using `REP MOVS` instruction accessing MMIO emulated in hypervisor"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a privileged HVM guest."
    ],
    "position": "Attacker needs to have a privileged access in HVM guest."
