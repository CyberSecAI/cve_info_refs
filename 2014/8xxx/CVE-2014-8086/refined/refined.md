  "CVE-2014-8086": {
    "description": "Race condition in the ext4_file_write_iter function in fs/ext4/file.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 allows local users to cause a denial of service (file unavailability) via a combination of a write action and an F_SETFL fcntl operation for the O_DIRECT flag.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the `ext4_file_write_iter` function within the ext4 filesystem code. This function is used for writing to files in the ext4 filesystem. The core issue is that the O_DIRECT flag for a file can be changed using `fcntl(F_SETFL)` concurrently while a write operation is in progress.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race Condition",
         "Improper Synchronization"
      ],
      "impact": "A local, unprivileged user could exploit this race condition to cause a denial of service by making the file unavailable, leading to a crash of the system.",
      "attack_vector": "Local Access",
      "attacker_capabilities": "A local, unprivileged user can trigger this race condition.",
        "technical_details": [
        "The vulnerability occurs due to a missing check of the `O_DIRECT` flag within `ext4_file_write_iter` during a write operation.",
        "The `O_DIRECT` flag can be toggled using `fcntl(F_SETFL)`, allowing for a change in file's write method while a write is in progress.",
        "The issue is related to how the kernel reads the o_direct status of the file within the write function.",
        "The race can occur between the read of the file's flags and the modification done by fcntl.",
         "Unaligned aio operations may widen the race window due to increased synchronization needs"
