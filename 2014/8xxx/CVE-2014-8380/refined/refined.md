{
  "CVE-2014-8380": {
    "Description": "Splunk is prone to a cross-site scripting vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in an unsuspecting user's browser in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the 'Referer' header.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary script code execution in a user's browser, potentially leading to stealing cookie-based authentication credentials and other attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious 'Referer' header in an HTTP request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send an HTTP request with a modified Referer header to a Splunk instance. No specific user interaction is required; the vulnerability is triggered when the application processes and renders the Referer header in the response.",
	"Affected software": "Splunk 6.1.1 (other versions may also be affected)"
  }
