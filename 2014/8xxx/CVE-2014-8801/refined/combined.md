It works great and from my research no free membership plugin even comes close.
My only reservation is that the Pro version is super-expensive. I would gladly pay a modest price for a additional few options that I want, but the bundle is out of my budget.

Perhaps one of the most frustrating pieces of software I’ve dealt with. They continually change / “upgrade” the plug-in without consideration for existing users who may not be as technical as their developers. A case in point is a relatively recent change to the Edit User pages. What was once a simple edit/update membership details, e.g. membership level, now requires navigation through multiple windows with no clear indication of what to do

This plugin is not compatible with buddypress or the theme compatible with buddypress!
After installing this plugin and setting it up after a free account = 0 dollars, the website became unavailable other than a page with info about paid membership or free membership.
No matter what I clicked on the menu on the website, it was locked to this page! Just had to uninstall the plugin to get access to my websites again. Now i looking for other solutions that could possibly be compatible!

Paid Memberships Pro is an outstanding plugin with some of the best support I’ve experienced. I’ve used several membership plugins and without doubt the value of PMPro is the best. The code base is regularly updated, there are numerous available add-ons and custom code recipes to find and use for various purposes, and the customer support is truly exceptional. The people behind PMPro are engaged with their community and make themselves available regularly for feedback and are receptive to customer ideas for ways to enhance the functionality of the plugin. I was hesitant to pay for this plugin at first given my experience with some other paid plugins, but I’m finding the cost is a very good value and that I’m saving time and money over having to find my own ways to accomplish my goals.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
