Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `getfile.php` file of the Paid Memberships Pro plugin. This file is accessible to everyone, and the code does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` parameter is not properly escaped, allowing attackers to include path traversal sequences like `/../` in the request.
*   **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The `is_admin()` function is used to check privileges, but it always evaluates to true because the vulnerable code is executed within the context of `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `REQUEST_URI` parameter. This could include sensitive files like `wp-config.php`, potentially exposing database credentials and other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
*   **`action` Parameter:**  The request includes the `action=getfile` parameter to trigger the vulnerable code.
*   **`REQUEST_URI` Manipulation:** By appending path traversal sequences, like `/../../`, to the `action` parameter's value, an attacker can navigate the file system and access files outside of the intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication, due to the flawed privilege check.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit was found in version 1.7.14.2 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.15 of the plugin.
*   The provided exploit example is `http://wordpress-url/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=getfile&/../../wp-config.php`

This exploit allows for arbitrary file disclosure, which is a severe vulnerability that could result in complete compromise of the affected system, depending on the files accessed.
