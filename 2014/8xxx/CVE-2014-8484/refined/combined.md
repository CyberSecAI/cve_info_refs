Subject: Re: strings / libbfd crasher

> <http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/stringme>

The immediate cause is due to srec_scan() in srec.c decreasing 'bytes'
without range checking until it wraps around. The already-bad value of
'bytes' is assigned to 'sec->size' few lines before the crash, so
perhaps there would be potential for exploitability later down the
line; but the code ends up crashing soon thereafter in a 'while (bytes
> 0)' loop that has no other exit conditions. That loop would need to
go over the entire address space without SEGV to avoid the crash.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: strings / libbfd crasher

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/psa-dont-run-strings-on-untrusted-files.html>

First, here are the two current CVE assignments for libbfd in GNU
binutils. More CVE assignments may occur later (in particular, see
below about versados.c). Affected programs apparently include strings
(on some but not all platforms) as well as objdump and nm. The readelf
program is not affected.

CVE-2014-8484 is for the incorrect decrements in cases of S-records
that are too short. References are:

  <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17509>
  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/23/5>

The available information at the moment is that this is fixed in
binutils 2.25 (not yet available on the
<http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/> site), whereas new discoveries in
October 2014 might not all be fixed in 2.25. Regardless of the actual
content of 2.25, CVE-2014-8484 will remain a separate CVE.

<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/10/23/8> (i.e., the
five-byte S100\n file) is not, by itself, an attack that crosses
privilege boundaries in realistic circumstances, so this report is not
currently part of any CVE.

CVE-2014-8485 is for the current
<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17510> content, i.e.,
incorrect "--n_elt / ++idx" code that makes the attachment 7846 and
attachment 7848 attacks possible.

The much earlier research by Tavis Ormandy is already covered by
CVE-2005-1704. There is also CVE-2006-2362, which is an unrelated
discovery.

There is currently no CVE ID for the
psa-dont-run-strings-on-untrusted-files.html "0xdeadbabe October 25,
2014 7:20 PM" comment about "another one related with PE file headers
parsing." In general, a separate discovery that's potentially
exploitable for code execution could have its own CVE ID. Does anyone
want a CVE ID for that?

Similarly, there are currently no CVE IDs for the
<https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16825> versados.c
report. Does anyone want that report covered in CVE? Depending on
exploitability, it would have approximately two CVE IDs.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=17509#c0)  Hanno Boeck    2014-10-24 11:41:24 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 7844](attachment.cgi?id=7844 "strings crasher 1") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=7844&action=edit "strings crasher 1") strings crasher 1  Attached are two samples that cause the strings tool to segfault. The first one has been found by Michal Zalewski and postet on twitter: <https://twitter.com/lcamtuf/status/524214698237898753>  Here's how he described the issue on oss-security: "The immediate cause is due to srec_scan() in srec.c decreasing 'bytes' without range checking until it wraps around. The already-bad value of 'bytes' is assigned to 'sec->size' few lines before the crash, so perhaps there would be potential for exploitability later down the line; but the code ends up crashing soon thereafter in a 'while (bytes > 0)' loop that has no other exit conditions. That loop would need to   go over the entire address space without SEGV to avoid the crash."  In reply to that someone else postet another crasher to oss-security that seems to expose a different code path.  Here's the corresponding thread: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/424> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=17509#c1)  Hanno Boeck    2014-10-24 11:41:49 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 7845](attachment.cgi?id=7845 "strings crasher 2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=7845&action=edit "strings crasher 2") strings crasher 2 ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=17509#c2)  Mike Frysinger    2014-10-24 16:21:18 UTC  ``` this was already fixed months ago and is included in the pending 2.25 release <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=bd25671c6f202c4a5108883caa2adb24ff6f361f> ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156272#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-24 03:59:20 UTC  ``` Michal Zalewski reported an invalid read flaw in libbfd, used by, for example, the "strings" utility. Running "strings" on a malicious file could cause "strings" to crash:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/424>  It is unclear yet if it is possible to leverage this issue for more than a crash.  Dave Rutherford noted on oss-security that using certain web browsers to save a malicious file could trigger this issue and cause the browser to crash:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q4/426>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1156272#c2)  Jeff Law    2014-10-24 15:07:56 UTC  ``` I haven't looked deeply at this, but if the problem is truely in the srec code rather than higher up in the call chain, then I'd consider this pretty low priority.  srecords aren't really used anymore and one could easily argue they should not be enabled by default anymore -- they're strictly for ancient (think 1970s/1980s) embedded systems.

# Binutils: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in Binutils, the worst of which
may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-devel/binutils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.25** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.25** |

### Background

The GNU Binutils are a collection of tools to create, modify and analyse
binary files. Many of the files use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor
library, to do low-level manipulation.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Binutils. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file,
possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or overwrite arbitrary
files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Binutils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-devel/binutils-2.25"

```

# USN-2496-1: GNU binutils vulnerabilities

9 February 2015

Applications from GNU binutils could be made to crash, run programs,
or delete arbitrary files as your login if they opened a specially
crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup\_group function in libbfd in

GNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8485](/security/CVE-2014-8485))

Hanno Böck discovered that the \_bfd\_XXi\_swap\_aouthdr\_in function

in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An

attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial

of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8501](/security/CVE-2014-8501))

Hanno Böck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the

pe\_print\_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker

could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8502](/security/CVE-2014-8502))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal

vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft

input that could delete arbitrary files. ([CVE-2014-8737](/security/CVE-2014-8737))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered the \_bfd\_slurp\_extended\_name\_table

function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling

extended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to

craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8738](/security/CVE-2014-8738))

Hanno Böck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex\_scan

function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this

to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash). ([CVE-2014-8503](/security/CVE-2014-8503))

Michal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the

srec\_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could

use this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service

(application crash); the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf

protection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-8504](/security/CVE-2014-8504))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the srec\_scan function in libbfd

in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could

use this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04

LTS. ([CVE-2014-8484](/security/CVE-2014-8484))

Sang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the

\_objalloc\_alloc function and objalloc\_alloc macro in binutils. This

could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application

crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2012-3509](/security/CVE-2012-3509))

Alexander Cherepanov and Hanno Böck discovered multiple additional

out-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use

these to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application

crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may

be limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort)

by the GNU C library's Fortify Source printf protection.

The strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when

examining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not

originally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As

a defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to

default to 'strings --all' behavior, which does not use libbfd; use

the new argument to strings, '--data', to recreate the old behavior.
