| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1095976#c0)  Matt Rogers    2014-05-09 02:02:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 893821](attachment.cgi?id=893821&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=893821&action=edit) proposed fix  Description of problem:  The nss-pam-ldapd daemon nslcd can be configured to find ldap servers via SRV lookups on a domain. With this configuration, a crash seen when starting nslcd can be caused by a number of specific SRV records presented to ldap_domain2hostlist().  The records are a set of 5+ SRV records for _ldap._tcp, all with a 5-digit port number, i.e. 12345.   [root@auto1 ~]# dig SRV _ldap._tcp.rodan.local | grep ldap ; <<>> DiG 9.8.2rc1-RedHat-9.8.2-0.23.rc1.el6_5.1 <<>> SRV _ldap._tcp.rodan.local ;_ldap._tcp.rodan.local.

Any 4 digit or less ports did not crash with the same entries, so I suspected that in ldap_domain2hostlist(), doing STRLENOF(":65355") with the 5 digit port ends up missing a byte. It also only starts to show up when there are 5 or more entries in the host list, as it appears that the sprintf at the end of the hostent_count loop needs to be called enough times for this to corrupt the hostlist array. With a larger number of entries the crash would probably have a greater chance of happening.  I'm attaching a patch that changes STRLENOF to sizeof, to account for the proper length needed in the buffer for a max length port. With the patch I tested multiple restarts of nslcd against the records and I wasn't able to reproduce the crash.   I think this bug should be evaluated as a possible CVE. In the event of DNS hijacking/spoofing, a malicious nameserver presenting these specific SRV records may be able to cause a DoS to ldap services that utilize ldap_domain2hostlist().  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openldap-2.4.23-34.el6_5.1  How reproducible: 1. Create SRV records in DNS as specified above 2.

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=998096#c0)  Victor Pereira   2016-09-09 07:32:13 UTC  ``` rh#1095976  Description of problem:  The nss-pam-ldapd daemon nslcd can be configured to find ldap servers via SRV lookups on a domain. With this configuration, a crash seen when starting nslcd can be caused by a number of specific SRV records presented to ldap_domain2hostlist().  The records are a set of 5+ SRV records for _ldap._tcp, all with a 5-digit port number, i.e. 12345.   [root@auto1 ~]# dig SRV _ldap._tcp.rodan.local | grep ldap ; <<>> DiG 9.8.2rc1-RedHat-9.8.2-0.23.rc1.el6_5.1 <<>> SRV _ldap._tcp.rodan.local ;_ldap._tcp.rodan.local.                IN      SRV _ldap._tcp.rodan.local. 3600    IN      SRV     1 5 15001 activedirectory2.rodan.local. _ldap._tcp.rodan.local. 3600    IN      SRV     1 5 15001 activedirectory3.rodan.local. _ldap._tcp.rodan.local. 3600    IN      SRV     1 5 15001 activedirectory4.rodan.local. _ldap._tcp.rodan.local. 3600    IN      SRV     0 5 15001 ads.rodan.local. _ldap._tcp.rodan.local. 3600    IN      SRV     0 5 15001 ads2.rodan.local. _ldap._tcp.rodan.local. 3600    IN      SRV     0 5 15001 ads3.rodan.local. _ldap._tcp.rodan.local. 3600    IN      SRV     1 5 15001 activedirectory.rodan.local.

Any 4 digit or less ports did not crash with the same entries, so I suspected that in ldap_domain2hostlist(), doing STRLENOF(":65355") with the 5 digit port ends up missing a byte. It also only starts to show up when there are 5 or more entries in the host list, as it appears that the sprintf at the end of the hostent_count loop needs to be called enough times for this to corrupt the hostlist array. With a larger number of entries the crash would probably have a greater chance of happening.  I'm attaching a patch that changes STRLENOF to sizeof, to account for the proper length needed in the buffer for a max length port. With the patch I tested multiple restarts of nslcd against the records and I wasn't able to reproduce the crash.   I think this bug should be evaluated as a possible CVE. In the event of DNS hijacking/spoofing, a malicious nameserver presenting these specific SRV records may be able to cause a DoS to ldap services that utilize ldap_domain2hostlist().  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openldap-2.4.23-34.el6_5.1  How reproducible: 1. Create SRV records in DNS as specified above 2. Configure nslcd to do SRV lookups to locate an ldap server (in /etc/nslcd.conf, set 'uri:DNS:domain') 3. Start nslcd in foreground debug mode (nslcd -d)   References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1095976> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-8182> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8182> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=998096#c1)  Victor Pereira   2016-09-09 07:32:31 UTC  ``` Looking at upstream git, this looks to have been fixed by d13285fd which would have the same effect as my patch:  commit d13285fdd81eeec010dd273090d45e55f4b400fe Author: Kurt Zeilenga <kurt@openldap.org> Date:   Mon Jul 8 18:45:53 2002 +0000      Fix possible under allocation of buffer  diff --git a/libraries/libldap/dnssrv.c b/libraries/libldap/dnssrv.c index cc193e9..0f7c863 100644 --- a/libraries/libldap/dnssrv.c +++ b/libraries/libldap/dnssrv.c @@ -261,7 +261,7 @@ int ldap_domain2hostlist(                 /* weight = (p[2] << 8) | p[3]; */                 port = (p[4] << 8) | p[5];   -               buflen = strlen(host) + sizeof(":65355"); +               buflen = strlen(host) + sizeof(":65355 ");                 hostlist = (char *) LDAP_REALLOC(hostlist, cur + buflen);                 if (hostlist == NULL) {                     rc = LDAP_NO_MEMORY; ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=998096#c2)  Howard Guo   2016-09-09 09:08:23 UTC  ``` I checked the source code and patches among SLE and openSUSE distributions and cannot find the offending code, Victor would you please double check again in case I missed anything? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=998096#c4)  Howard Guo   2016-09-09 12:23:21 UTC  ``` Hi Victor.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1095976#c0)  Matt Rogers    2014-05-09 02:02:05 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 893821](attachment.cgi?id=893821&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=893821&action=edit) proposed fix  Description of problem:  The nss-pam-ldapd daemon nslcd can be configured to find ldap servers via SRV lookups on a domain. With this configuration, a crash seen when starting nslcd can be caused by a number of specific SRV records presented to ldap_domain2hostlist().  The records are a set of 5+ SRV records for _ldap._tcp, all with a 5-digit port number, i.e. 12345.   [root@auto1 ~]# dig SRV _ldap._tcp.rodan.local | grep ldap ; <<>> DiG 9.8.2rc1-RedHat-9.8.2-0.23.rc1.el6_5.1 <<>> SRV _ldap._tcp.rodan.local ;_ldap._tcp.rodan.local.

On startup this crash happens most of the time, and can appear differently:  [root@auto1 ~]# nslcd -d nslcd: DEBUG: query rodan.local for SRV records *** glibc detected *** nslcd: realloc(): invalid next size: 0x0000000001e29480 *** ======= Backtrace: ========= /lib64/libc.so.6(+0x76166)[0x7fda91c7a166] /lib64/libc.so.6(+0x7bc17)[0x7fda91c7fc17] /lib64/libc.so.6(realloc+0xe5)[0x7fda91c7fdd5] /lib64/liblber-2.4.so.2(ber_memrealloc_x+0x2a)[0x7fda919fd87a] /lib64/libldap_r-2.4.so.2(ldap_domain2hostlist+0x423)[0x7fda92400f33] nslcd[0x407fb1] nslcd[0x408c0e]  nslcd[0x40a21d]  nslcd[0x403a75]  /lib64/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xfd)[0x7fda91c22d1d] nslcd[0x402d39]  ======= Memory map: ======== 00400000-0041d000 r-xp 00000000 fd:00 405486                             /usr/sbin/nslcd 0061d000-0061e000 rw-p 0001d000 fd:00 405486                             /usr/sbin/nslcd 01e28000-01e49000 rw-p 00000000 00:00 0                                  [heap] 7fda8ed94000-7fda8ee05000 r-xp 00000000 fd:00 261638                     /lib64/libfreebl3.so ...

Any 4 digit or less ports did not crash with the same entries, so I suspected that in ldap_domain2hostlist(), doing STRLENOF(":65355") with the 5 digit port ends up missing a byte. It also only starts to show up when there are 5 or more entries in the host list, as it appears that the sprintf at the end of the hostent_count loop needs to be called enough times for this to corrupt the hostlist array. With a larger number of entries the crash would probably have a greater chance of happening.  I'm attaching a patch that changes STRLENOF to sizeof, to account for the proper length needed in the buffer for a max length port. With the patch I tested multiple restarts of nslcd against the records and I wasn't able to reproduce the crash.   I think this bug should be evaluated as a possible CVE. In the event of DNS hijacking/spoofing, a malicious nameserver presenting these specific SRV records may be able to cause a DoS to ldap services that utilize ldap_domain2hostlist().  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openldap-2.4.23-34.el6_5.1  How reproducible: 1. Create SRV records in DNS as specified above 2. Configure nslcd to do SRV lookups to locate an ldap server (in /etc/nslcd.conf, set 'uri:DNS:domain') 3. Start nslcd in foreground debug mode (nslcd -d)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1095976#c5)  Vincent Danen    2014-05-30 17:47:14 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Matt Rogers of Red Hat.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1095976#c6)  Matt Rogers    2014-05-30 18:35:31 UTC  ``` Hey, sorry about that.
