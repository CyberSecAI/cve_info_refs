  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-8182",
    "description": "An off-by-one error leading to a crash was discovered in openldap 2.4 when processing DNS SRV messages. If slapd was configured to use the dnssrv backend, an attacker could crash the service with crafted DNS responses.",
    "affected_component": "openldap",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is an off-by-one error in the `ldap_domain2hostlist` function when handling DNS SRV records with 5-digit port numbers. The code used `strlen` plus a fixed size for buffer allocation, which was insufficient for the port number, leading to memory corruption when writing the port number during string formatting.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Off-by-one error",
      "Memory corruption",
      "Insufficient buffer allocation"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). A crafted DNS response can crash the `slapd` process if configured to use the `dnssrv` backend.",
    "attack_vector": "Network. An attacker can send a crafted DNS response to an LDAP server configured to use SRV records.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DNS responses to the vulnerable server. This might involve man-in-the-middle attacks, DNS spoofing/hijacking, or controlling the DNS server.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerable code was introduced by a patch specific to Red Hat and was not present in the upstream OpenLDAP code. The issue occurs when an SRV record contains a 5-digit port number and multiple SRV records are processed.  A fix was implemented in OpenLDAP, but was not incorporated into all distributions, requiring backports."
