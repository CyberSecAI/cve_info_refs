Asterisk
Project Security Advisory â AST-2014-017

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Permission escalation through ConfBridge actions/dialplan functions |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Permission Escalation |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Authenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | November 4, 2014 |
| **Reported By** | Gareth Palmer |

| **Advisory Contact** | Kevin Harwell <kharwell AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2014-8417 |

| **Description** | The CONFBRIDGE dialplan function when executed from an external protocol (for instance AMI), could result in a privilege escalation. Also, the AMI action âConfbridgeStartRecordâ could also be used to execute arbitrary system commands without first checking for system access. |

| **Resolution** | Asterisk now inhibits the CONFBRIDGE function from being executed from an external interface if the live\_dangerously option is set to no. Also, the âConfbridgeStartRecordâ AMI action is now only allowed to execute under a user with system level access. |
