Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of configuration input within the Dell SonicWALL GMS ViewPoint (GMSVP) web application. Specifically, it's caused by a failure to properly sanitize user-provided data before executing a command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The GMSVP application fails to sanitize user-provided data before using it in a command execution. This is a classic vulnerability where untrusted data is directly used in system calls, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable Dell SonicWALL GMS Virtual Appliance.
- **Root Privileges:** The executed code will run with root privileges on the underlying operating system, giving the attacker full control of the appliance.
- **Complete System Compromise:** The impact can lead to a complete compromise of the GMS Virtual Appliance, potentially affecting the managed network devices and data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Web Application (GMSVP):** The specific vulnerability exists within the GMS ViewPoint (GMSVP) web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the GMS Virtual Appliance to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests that only authorized users (or attackers who have gained unauthorized access) can execute the code.

**Additional Details:**
- SonicWALL released an update to correct this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2014-07-21, and the coordinated public release of the advisory occurred on 2014-11-21.

In summary, CVE-2014-8420 is a critical vulnerability that allows authenticated attackers to gain complete control of the Dell SonicWALL GMS Virtual Appliance via a remote code execution flaw due to insufficient input sanitization, highlighting the importance of input validation in software development.
