How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Summary | 0017742: CVE-2014-8988: Attachments can be downloaded without permission | | | | |
| Description | Even if you set the variables "download\_attachments\_threshold" and "view\_attachments\_threshold" to the value 55 (developer) users with less privilege (e.g. reporter) can download attachments, if they guess the URL correctly.  For instance they just have to enter a URL like <https://servername/mantis/file_download.php?file_id=4432&type=bug> and they may download the file. Since it is rather easy to guess the file\_id the attack is quite serious. | | | | |
| Additional Information | Rewording original report's description to clarify the actual issue:  Due to an incorrect access check, by guessing the download URL correctly, unprivileged users can download files from a private project with restricted access to attachments, i.e. where $g\_download\_attachments\_threshold / $g\_view\_attachments\_threshold are set e.g. to 55 (developer), if another project to which they have access does not restrict attachments download. | | | | |

If so it could possibly be a caching issue. |

| [grangeway](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=2405)   [grangeway](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=2405)  2014-10-09 13:34  reporter    [~0041491](view.php?id=17742#c41491 "Direct link to note") | *sigh* I hate our api  Whilst this might not be the case here:  I'd stab a guess that this could be happening if you have multiple projects, and is why I started on the MantisContext and Bug Objects approach before.  If a user has "Project A" selected (which they have manager access to), and tries to access the file download link for a bug in project B (which they don't have download access to).  This will call file\_can\_download\_bug\_attachments:  This then calls: $t\_can\_download = access\_has\_bug\_level( config\_get( 'download\_attachments\_threshold' ), $p\_bug\_id ); $t\_can\_download = $t\_can\_download || ( $t\_uploaded\_by\_me && config\_get( 'allow\_download\_own\_attachments' ) );  In this case, the config\_get command is going to run in the context of "Project A" - it's then going to check access\_has\_bug\_level against the bug id and the context of "Project B"  This is really due to having no "project override set" in file\_download.php  However, as the file api's might be called by plugins / other code, the correct fix would be to either:  a) change the parameter type from integer to MantisBug, and then call config\_get with MantisBug->project\_id  Or  b) leave the parameter type as it is now, and call bug\_get(), then pass the project id to the config\_Get call  This should be done across the codebase where appropriate.  In file\_api.php, it needs to be done in 3 functions:  file\_can\_delete\_bug\_attachments file\_can\_download\_bug\_attachments file\_can\_view\_bug\_attachments  Previously, I started going with the approach of passing the object out of bug\_get() around to avoid multiple calls to bug\_get(), and therefore slowly removing use of 'id', so we always get an accessible bug object. |

It does not seem to be a caching problem. I used Firefox in privacy mode, closed it and additionally removed all the cookies to be sure. Still the attacker could access the attached file.  All our projects are marked as "private". The attacker has access to more than one project including the one he is able to open the attachments in. He does not see the attachments listed in ProjectXX I mentioned earlier though due to our configuration.  However, we granted the attacker permission so he sees the "issue history". The filename appears in the issue history although he does not see the attachments unless he executes the attack described above. This might be an additional security problem or related to this one. |

[@ffuchs](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=35922), instead of "hints", it would be much more helpful if you could provide us clear, step-by-step instructions to reproduce this issue, preferably from a fresh install.  The filename appears in the issue history although he does not see the attachments  I agree this is a minor disclosure issue, it can be addressed separately (I opened [0017744](/bugs/view.php?id=17744 "[closed] Attachments displayed in history despite user not authorised to view them") to track this). |

However, I cannot do a fresh install because we already have more than 10.000 entries in our system because we are using it for six years now. If it is of any help to you I can demonstrate the problem on our system next week via a TeamViewer session. |

User U1 must not be DEVELOPER in project P1.  Steps to reproduce the issue:   * Create two private projects P1 and P2 * Set download\_attachments\_threshold and view\_attachments\_threshold to 55 for project P2 * Create user U1 with access level REPORTER in projectd P1 and P2 * Create issue with attachment in project P2 * Login as U1 * Choose P1 in project selection list * Open URL for file in project P2   As mentioned by grangeway, the problem is that we look at the selected (current) project instead of looking at the project where the issue belongs to. |

Multiple security issues have been found in the Mantis bug tracking
system, which may result in phishing, information disclosure, CAPTCHA
bypass, SQL injection, cross-site scripting or the execution of arbitrary
PHP code.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.18-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mantis packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Even if config variables $g_download_attachments_threshold and
$g_view_attachments_threshold are set to 55 (developer), users with
lower privileges can download attachments.

Message-ID: <m483v4$7pt$1@ger.gmane.org>
Date: Sat, 15 Nov 2014 18:53:41 +0100
From: Damien Regad <dregad@...tisbt.org>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE Request: information disclosure in MantisBT attachments

Please assign a CVE ID for the following issue.

Description:

MantisBT issue attachments can be downloaded without permission.

Due to an incorrect access check, by guessing the download URL
correctly, unprivileged users can download files from a private project
with restricted access to attachments, i.e. where
$g_download_attachments_threshold /
$g_view_attachments_threshold are set e.g. to 55 (developer), if another
project to which they have access does not restrict attachments download.

Affected versions:
<= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:
Issue was discovered by Florian Fuchs and fixed by Paul Richards (former
MantisBT developer)

References:
Further details available in our issue tracker [2]
