Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-8373:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the "Connect (by) Using VMRC" functionality in VMware vCloud Automation Center (vCAC) that allows direct connections to vCenter Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated vCAC user can exploit the VMRC connection mechanism to gain administrative access to vCenter Server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation grants an attacker administrative privileges on the vCenter Server.
- **Complete compromise of vCenter:** Once a malicious actor has gained administrative access, they would have the ability to modify or delete critical system data or install backdoors for persistent access

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed remotely over a network.
- **Direct VMRC Connection:** Exploitation occurs when vCAC uses the "Connect (by) Using VMRC" function to directly connect to vCenter Server. Environments utilizing vCloud Director (vCD) as a proxy are not affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated vCAC User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the vCloud Automation Center.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by removing the "Connect (by) Using VMRC" functionality via a patch.
- VMware is working on a secure solution to restore this functionality in the future.
- The vulnerability affects vCloud Automation Center versions 6.x without the patch.
- vRealize Automation 6.2 is not affected as it ships with the vulnerable feature removed.
- Other remote connection options like RDP and SSH are not affected by this vulnerability.
