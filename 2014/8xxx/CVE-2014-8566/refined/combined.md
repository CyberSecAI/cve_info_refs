# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

An updated mod\_auth\_mellon package that fixes two security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

mod\_auth\_mellon provides a SAML 2.0 authentication module for the Apache
HTTP Server.

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_auth\_mellon's session
handling that could lead to sessions overlapping in memory. A remote
attacker could potentially use this flaw to obtain data from another user's
session. (CVE-2014-8566)

It was found that uninitialized data could be read when processing a user's
logout request. By attempting to log out, a user could possibly cause the
Apache HTTP Server to crash. (CVE-2014-8567)

Red Hat would like to thank the mod\_auth\_mellon team for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Matthew Slowe as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-8566.

All users of mod\_auth\_mellon are advised to upgrade to this updated
package, which contains a backported patch to correct these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-26 23:09:54 UTC  ``` mod_auth_mellon provides a SAML 2.0 authentication module for the Apache HTTP Server. A flaw was found that could result in sessions overlapping in memory. A remote attacker could use this flaw to leak memory that possibly contains sensitive information.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c3)  Simo Sorce    2014-10-27 12:55:01 UTC  ``` Note that it is not totally clear to me that memory is disclosed remotely, it certainly is discolosed to local applications in apache variables. However such a leak could result in disclosures if the right vartiables are affect, also segfaults have been reported, so perhaps even exploitable in some cases.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-28 05:57:34 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the mod_auth_mellon team for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Matthew Slowe as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c8)  Simo Sorce    2014-11-03 14:14:37 UTC  ``` Issue is public now: <https://postlister.uninett.no/sympa/arc/modmellon/2014-11/msg00000.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c9)  Murray McAllister    2014-11-04 01:38:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Murray McAllister from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c0)) > mod_auth_mellon provides a SAML 2.0 authentication module for the Apache > HTTP Server. A flaw was found that could result in sessions overlapping in > memory. A remote attacker could use this flaw to leak memory that possibly > contains sensitive information.  Upstream describes this issue as:  It turned out that session overflow bugs fixes in version 0.9.0 and 0.9.1 can lead to information disclosure, where data from one session is leaked to another session. Depending on how this data is used by the web application, this may lead to data from one session being disclosed to an user in a different session. ([CVE-2014-8566](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-8566))   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c10)  Martin Prpič    2014-11-04 08:38:32 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_auth_mellon's session handling that could lead to session overlapping in memory. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to obtain data from another user's session.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-11-05 09:52:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2014:1803 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1803.html>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1157281#c12)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-11-05 13:13:54 UTC  ``` Fedora 21 already ships mod_auth_mellon-0.9.1-1.fc21 and therefore is not affected by this issue.   ``` |  |

[`36e9738`](/Uninett/mod_auth_mellon/commit/36e9738fde1acd7da1600a637ae7c9adc236eee9)

This is a security release with fixes backported from version 0.9.1.

It turned out that session overflow bugs fixes in version 0.9.0 and

0.9.1 can lead to information disclosure, where data from one session

is leaked to another session. Depending on how this data is used by the

web application, this may lead to data from one session being disclosed

to an user in a different session. ([CVE-2014-8566](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4cw9-fccf-p75x "CVE-2014-8566"))

In addition to the information disclosure, this release contains some

fixes for logout processing, where logout requests would crash the

Apache web server. ([CVE-2014-8567](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wggx-3j62-wmwr "CVE-2014-8567"))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks by providing specially crafted responses from a Git server which triggers resource exhaustion in go-git clients. Users running versions of go-git from v4 and above are recommended to upgrade to v5.13 in order to mitigate this vulnerability. | 2025-01-06 | | [CVE-2025-21613](/cve/CVE-2025-21613.html) | go-git is a highly extensible git implementation library written in pure Go. An argument injection vulnerability was discovered in go-git versions prior to v5.13. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary values to git-upload-pack flags. This only happens when the file transport protocol is being used, as that is the only protocol that shells out to git binaries.

A symlink traversal vulnerability in the containers/storage library can cause Podman, Buildah, and CRI-O to hang and result in a denial of service via OOM kill when running a malicious image using an automatically assigned user namespace (`--userns=auto` in Podman and Buildah). The containers/storage library will read /etc/passwd inside the container, but does not properly validate if that file is a symlink, which can be used to cause the library to read an arbitrary file on the host. | 2024-10-15 | | [CVE-2024-9675](/cve/CVE-2024-9675.html) | A vulnerability was found in Buildah. Cache mounts do not properly validate that user-specified paths for the cache are within our cache directory, allowing a 'RUN' instruction in a Container file to mount an arbitrary directory from the host (read/write) into the container as long as those files can be accessed by the user running Buildah. | 2024-10-09 | | [CVE-2024-9632](/cve/CVE-2024-9632.html) | A flaw was found in the X.org server. Due to improperly tracked allocation size in \_XkbSetCompatMap, a local attacker may be able to trigger a buffer overflow condition via a specially crafted payload, leading to denial of service or local privilege escalation in distributions where the X.org server is run with root privileges. | 2024-10-29 | | [CVE-2024-9407](/cve/CVE-2024-9407.html) | A vulnerability exists in the bind-propagation option of the Dockerfile RUN --mount instruction. The system does not properly validate the input passed to this option, allowing users to pass arbitrary parameters to the mount instruction. This issue can be exploited to mount sensitive directories from the host into a container during the build process and, in some cases, modify the contents of those mounted files. Even if SELinux is used, this vulnerability can bypass its protection by allowing the source directory to be relabeled to give the container access to host files. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9403](/cve/CVE-2024-9403.html) | Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 130. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131 and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9402](/cve/CVE-2024-9402.html) | Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 130, Firefox ESR 128.2, and Thunderbird 128.2.

This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Firefox ESR < 115.16, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9400](/cve/CVE-2024-9400.html) | A potential memory corruption vulnerability could be triggered if an attacker had the ability to trigger an OOM at a specific moment during JIT compilation. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9399](/cve/CVE-2024-9399.html) | A website configured to initiate a specially crafted WebTransport session could crash the Firefox process leading to a denial of service condition. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9398](/cve/CVE-2024-9398.html) | By checking the result of calls to `window.open` with specifically set protocol handlers, an attacker could determine if the application which implements that protocol handler is installed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9397](/cve/CVE-2024-9397.html) | A missing delay in directory upload UI could have made it possible for an attacker to trick a user into granting permission via clickjacking. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9396](/cve/CVE-2024-9396.html) | It is currently unknown if this issue is exploitable but a condition may arise where the structured clone of certain objects could lead to memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9394](/cve/CVE-2024-9394.html) | An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://devtools` origin. This could allow them to access cross-origin JSON content. This access is limited to 'same site' documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Firefox ESR < 115.16, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9393](/cve/CVE-2024-9393.html) | An attacker could, via a specially crafted multipart response, execute arbitrary JavaScript under the `resource://pdf.js` origin. This could allow them to access cross-origin PDF content. This access is limited to 'same site' documents by the Site Isolation feature on desktop clients, but full cross-origin access is possible on Android versions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Firefox ESR < 115.16, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9392](/cve/CVE-2024-9392.html) | A compromised content process could have allowed for the arbitrary loading of cross-origin pages. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 131, Firefox ESR < 128.3, Firefox ESR < 115.16, Thunderbird < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 131. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9355](/cve/CVE-2024-9355.html) | A vulnerability was found in Golang FIPS OpenSSL. This flaw allows a malicious user to randomly cause an uninitialized buffer length variable with a zeroed buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac sum to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place of a pre-computed sum. It is also possible to force a derived key to be all zeros instead of an unpredictable value. This may have follow-on implications for the Go TLS stack. | 2024-09-30 | | [CVE-2024-9341](/cve/CVE-2024-9341.html) | A flaw was found in Go. When FIPS mode is enabled on a system, container runtimes may incorrectly handle certain file paths due to improper validation in the containers/common Go library. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit symbolic links and trick the system into mounting sensitive host directories inside a container. This issue also allows attackers to access critical host files, bypassing the intended isolation between containers and the host system. | 2024-10-01 | | [CVE-2024-9287](/cve/CVE-2024-9287.html) | A vulnerability has been found in the CPython `venv` module and CLI where path names provided when creating a virtual environment were not quoted properly, allowing the creator to inject commands into virtual environment 'activation' scripts (ie 'source venv/bin/activate'). This means that attacker-controlled virtual environments are able to run commands when the virtual environment is activated. Virtual environments which are not created by an attacker or which aren't activated before being used (ie './venv/bin/python') are not affected. | 2024-10-22 | | [CVE-2024-9050](/cve/CVE-2024-9050.html) | A flaw was found in the libreswan client plugin for NetworkManager (NetkworkManager-libreswan), where it fails to properly sanitize the VPN configuration from the local unprivileged user. In this configuration, composed by a key-value format, the plugin fails to escape special characters, leading the application to interpret values as keys. One of the most critical parameters that could be abused by a malicious user is the `leftupdown`key. This key takes an executable command as a value and is used to specify what executes as a callback in NetworkManager-libreswan to retrieve configuration settings back to NetworkManager. As NetworkManager uses Polkit to allow an unprivileged user to control the system's network configuration, a malicious actor could achieve local privilege escalation and potential code execution as root in the targeted machine by creating a malicious configuration. | 2024-10-22 | | [CVE-2024-9026](/cve/CVE-2024-9026.html) | In PHP versions 8.1.\* before 8.1.30, 8.2.\* before 8.2.24, 8.3.\* before 8.3.12, when using PHP-FPM SAPI and it is configured to catch workers output through catch\_workers\_output = yes, it may be possible to pollute the final log or remove up to 4 characters from the log messages by manipulating log message content. Additionally, if PHP-FPM is configured to use syslog output, it may be possible to further remove log data using the same vulnerability. | 2024-10-08 | | [CVE-2024-8927](/cve/CVE-2024-8927.html) | In PHP versions 8.1.\* before 8.1.30, 8.2.\* before 8.2.24, 8.3.\* before 8.3.12, HTTP\_REDIRECT\_STATUS variable is used to check whether or not CGI binary is being run by the HTTP server. However, in certain scenarios, the content of this variable can be controlled by the request submitter via HTTP headers, which can lead to cgi.force\_redirect option not being correctly applied. In certain configurations this may lead to arbitrary file inclusion in PHP. | 2024-10-07 | | [CVE-2024-8925](/cve/CVE-2024-8925.html) | In PHP versions 8.1.\* before 8.1.30, 8.2.\* before 8.2.24, 8.3.\* before 8.3.12, erroneous parsing of multipart form data contained in an HTTP POST request could lead to legitimate data not being processed. This could lead to malicious attacker able to control part of the submitted data being able to exclude portion of other data, potentially leading to erroneous application behavior. | 2024-10-07 | | [CVE-2024-8900](/cve/CVE-2024-8900.html) | An attacker could write data to the user's clipboard, bypassing the user prompt, during a certain sequence of navigational events. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 129, Firefox ESR < 128.3, and Thunderbird < 128.3. | 2024-09-17 | | [CVE-2024-8508](/cve/CVE-2024-8508.html) | NLnet Labs Unbound up to and including version 1.21.0 contains a vulnerability when handling replies with very large RRsets that it needs to perform name compression for. Malicious upstreams responses with very large RRsets can cause Unbound to spend a considerable time applying name compression to downstream replies. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually denial of service in well orchestrated attacks. The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious actor querying Unbound for the specially crafted contents of a malicious zone with very large RRsets. Before Unbound replies to the query it will try to apply name compression which was an unbounded operation that could lock the CPU until the whole packet was complete. Unbound version 1.21.1 introduces a hard limit on the number of name compression calculations it is willing to do per packet. Packets that need more compression will result in semi-compressed packets or truncated packets, even on TCP for huge messages, to avoid locking the CPU for long. This change should not affect normal DNS traffic. | 2024-10-03 | | [CVE-2024-8445](/cve/CVE-2024-8445.html) | The fix for CVE-2024-2199 in 389-ds-base was insufficient to cover all scenarios. In certain product versions, an authenticated user may cause a server crash while modifying `userPassword` using malformed input. | 2024-09-05 | | [CVE-2024-8394](/cve/CVE-2024-8394.html) | When aborting the verification of an OTR chat session, an attacker could have caused a use-after-free bug leading to a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 128.2. | 2024-09-06 | | [CVE-2024-8387](/cve/CVE-2024-8387.html) | Memory safety bugs present in Firefox 129, Firefox ESR 128.1, and Thunderbird 128.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

This could have led to memory corruption. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 130, Firefox ESR < 128.2, Firefox ESR < 115.15, Thunderbird < 128.2, and Thunderbird < 115.15. | 2024-09-03 | | [CVE-2024-8383](/cve/CVE-2024-8383.html) | Firefox normally asks for confirmation before asking the operating system to find an application to handle a scheme that the browser does not support. It did not ask before doing so for the Usenet-related schemes news: and snews:. Since most operating systems don't have a trusted newsreader installed by default, an unscrupulous program that the user downloaded could register itself as a handler. The website that served the application download could then launch that application at will. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 130, Firefox ESR < 128.2, and Firefox ESR < 115.15. | 2024-09-03 | | [CVE-2024-8382](/cve/CVE-2024-8382.html) | Internal browser event interfaces were exposed to web content when privileged EventHandler listener callbacks ran for those events. Web content that tried to use those interfaces would not be able to use them with elevated privileges, but their presence would indicate certain browser features had been used, such as when a user opened the Dev Tools console. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 130, Firefox ESR < 128.2, Firefox ESR < 115.15, Thunderbird < 128.2, and Thunderbird < 115.15. | 2024-09-03 | | [CVE-2024-8381](/cve/CVE-2024-8381.html) | A potentially exploitable type confusion could be triggered when looking up a property name on an object being used as the `with` environment.
