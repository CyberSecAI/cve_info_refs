Response:
```
The provided documents contain information about CVE-2014-8502.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is due to a heap-based buffer overflow in the `pe_print_edata` function within the libbfd library of GNU binutils. This function processes export data in Portable Executable (PE) files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Heap-based buffer overflow in `pe_print_edata` function.
- The vulnerability stems from improper bounds checking when parsing export data tables in PE files. Specifically it occurs while handling the Export Address table, Name Pointer table and Ordinal table.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service (application crash): An attacker can craft a malicious PE file that will trigger the overflow, causing the application using libbfd (e.g., objdump, strings) to crash.
- Arbitrary code execution: It is also possible that a crafted file could be made to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process opening the file, though this is not explicitly confirmed.
- Overwriting of arbitrary files: It is possible this vulnerability could lead to overwriting arbitrary files.

Attack vectors:
- Exploitation occurs through specially crafted PE files.
- Attackers can entice a user to open a specially crafted file using vulnerable applications.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Attackers need to create a malicious PE binary file.
- Attackers require the target to open the crafted PE file using an application linked against a vulnerable version of libbfd (such as objdump, strings, nm).
- The attacker could be local or remote, using some kind of social engineering.
