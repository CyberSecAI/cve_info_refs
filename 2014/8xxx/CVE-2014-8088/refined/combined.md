# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 April 2015
* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016

Use CVE-2014-8088 (for the issue in both Zend Framework 1.x and
Zend Framework 2.x).

Use CVE-2014-8089 (for the issue in both Zend Framework 1.x and
Zend Framework 2.x).

Our understanding is that ZF2014-05 is not closely related to the
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/09/2> topic. That
June post is about incorrect use of the "empty" PHP library function,
an implementation error that (as far as we know) occurred only in
Horde. ZF2014-05 is about \0 characters, an implementation error that
occurred in Zend Framework and also in, for example, MantisBT (see the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/12/14> post).
