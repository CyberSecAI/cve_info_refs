Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8874:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The TYPO3 extension `ke_questionnaire` stores answered questionnaires in a publicly accessible directory (`typo3temp`) on the web server. The filenames are predictable, being based on the questionnaire ID and the user ID of the user who created the questionnaire. This allows an attacker to potentially guess or brute-force the location of these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of potentially sensitive information stored in the questionnaire files.
*   **Predictable Filenames:** The predictable naming scheme of the files allows attackers to easily guess file locations.
*   **Publicly Accessible Directory:** The files are stored in a publicly accessible directory on the web server, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Personal Information:** Depending on the content of the questionnaires, personal information, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and other sensitive data could be exposed.
*   **Privacy Violation:** This information disclosure can lead to privacy violations for the individuals who filled out the questionnaires.
*   **Medium Security Risk:** The advisory rates the security risk as medium, because the risk strongly depends on the information supplied in the questionnaires.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Access:** An attacker can directly access the files via HTTP by constructing the correct URL containing the predictable filename.
*   **Brute-Force/Guessing:** Attackers can use tools to automate the process of guessing file paths based on the known naming convention.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the webserver hosting the vulnerable TYPO3 instance.
*   **Knowledge of File Naming Scheme:** The attacker needs to know that the file names are predictable based on user ID and questionaire ID. They need not be able to view source code but understand the naming scheme.
*   **Basic Scripting Skills:** An attacker may use tools like wfuzz to automate the guessing of file paths.
