{
  "cve": "CVE-2014-8503",
  "description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ihex_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker can craft a malicious ihex file that, when parsed by objdump, could result in a denial of service or potentially, arbitrary code execution.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ihex_scan function in libbfd does not properly validate input data, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
	  "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service (application crash) or potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running objdump.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A crafted IHEX file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious IHEX file as input to a tool (such as objdump) that utilizes the vulnerable ihex parser."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "duplicate_bug": "Bug 19296 is a duplicate related to a memory crush caused by insufficient size checks in archive.c",
    "affected_software_versions": "The issue was found in binutils version 2.24.",
	"fixes": "Patches were applied to address the memory corruption, use-after-free, heap overflow, and stack overflow issues, and they were backported to the 2.25 branch as well"
