KVM: emulate: do not initialize memopp

```
rip_relative is only set if decode_modrm runs, and if you have ModRM
you will also have a memopp.  We can then access memopp unconditionally.
Note that rip_relative cannot be hoisted up to decode_modrm, or you
break "mov $0, xyz(%rip)".

Also, move typecast on "out of range value" of mem.ea to decode_modrm.

Together, all these optimizations save about 50 cycles on each emulated
instructions (4-6%).

## Description

The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 lacks intended decoder-table flags for certain RIP-relative instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application.

KVM: x86: PREFETCH and HINT\_NOP should have SrcMem flag

```
The decode phase of the x86 emulator assumes that every instruction with the
ModRM flag, and which can be used with RIP-relative addressing, has either
SrcMem or DstMem.  This is not the case for several instructions - prefetch,
hint-nop and clflush.

Adding SrcMem|NoAccess for prefetch and hint-nop and SrcMem for clflush.

This fixes [CVE-2014-8480](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6mgv-w6x6-2c97 "CVE-2014-8480").

Subject: CVE Request: Linux 3.17 guest-triggerable KVM OOPS

On Linux 3.17, a KVM guest can trigger a NULL pointer dereference by
forcing the host to emulate certain well-formed RIP-relative
instructions or certain types of corrupt or page-straddling
instructions.  This is almost certainly just a DoS -- there is a
single read-modify-write to the NULL pointer, and no kernel code will
consume data loaded from the NULL pointer if something is mapped
there.

The bugs, or at least dangerous code, arguably existed in much older
kernels, but the NULL pointer dereference was introduced in
41061cdb98a0bec464278b4db8e894a3121671f5, which is only present in
3.17.

To fix it, you can either revert the broken patch or you can apply
both patches here as well as the attached patch:
<http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/128427>
(NB: I'm not sure whether "Emulator does not decode clflush well" is necessary.)

Details:

Depending on your point of view, there are either one or two bugs
here.  Nadav Amit discovered an error in the instruction decoder that
would cause certain RIP-relative instructions to OOPS the decoder.
Specifically, rather than adding RIP to the operand address, RIP would
be added to *0 from the host's perspective.

I wrote an ugly proof-of-concept to trigger it (kvm_clflush_oops.c,
although I've cleaned it up somewhat since I originally wrote it).
That PoC only works on an SMP guest, and only when run as root.

I also discovered that Nadav's fix was incomplete (or that there was
another bug, depending on your perspective).  Certain invalid
instructions (due to multiple error cases, including a failure to
fetch part of the instruction or due to the instruction being too
long) could trigger the same NULL pointer dereference.

Nadav wrote an extremely elegant PoC that exploits this buggy error
handling, reproduced with permission below.  This PoC doesn't require
SMP or privilege; it's just crashes the host directly.  Figuring out
how it works is left as an exercise to the reader (hint: it might not
work on Atom hosts).

Please assign one or two CVEs as appropriate.  (And, if you're hosting
untrusted code on a Linux 3.17 host, patch your system!)

#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
        void *mem = mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_EXEC | PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
                        MAP_ANON | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_POPULATE, -1, 0);
        memcpy((char*)mem + 0xff3,
            "\xf0\x65\x65\x65\x65\x65\x65\x0f\x38\xf1"
            "\x05\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00", 15);
        asm volatile(“jmp *%0\n\t” : : "r" (mem+0xff3));
        return 0;
}
