- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The DB dialplan function, when executed from an external protocol like AMI (Asterisk Manager Interface), could lead to a privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control/privilege management. Specifically, the DB dialplan function was not properly restricted when called from external interfaces.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation, where an attacker with access to an external protocol can gain higher privileges than intended.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote authenticated sessions. An attacker needs to be able to authenticate to an external protocol (like AMI) to trigger the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the Asterisk system via an external protocol such as AMI.
