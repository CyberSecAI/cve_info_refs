Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is that applications on Huawei Ascend P6 mobile phones can capture screenshots without requiring root permissions. This allows a malicious application to record sensitive information displayed on the screen.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Permission Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper permission checks for screen capture functionality. Regular applications should not be able to capture screen content without explicit user authorization or system-level permission.
- **Information Exposure:** The ability to capture screenshots without proper permissions directly leads to the exposure of user information displayed on the screen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Information Leakage:** Malicious applications can steal user data displayed on the screen, such as passwords, personal information, financial details, SMS content, etc.
- **Privacy Violation:** The unauthorized screen capture is a significant violation of user privacy.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Stolen information could be used for other malicious activities, like identity theft, financial fraud, or further compromising the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malware Installation:** The primary attack vector is through the installation of a malicious application on the target device.
- **User Deception:** Attackers rely on tricking the user into installing the malware by social engineering techniques, disguised apps, or other methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malware Development:** Attackers need the capability to develop malicious Android applications with the screen capture functionality.
- **Application Distribution:** The attacker needs to distribute the malicious application and trick users to install it. This could be through app stores, third-party websites, or other methods.
- **No Root Access Required:** The vulnerability itself does not require the attacker to gain root access on the device.
