 ```
 RELATED: This document mentions both CVE-2014-8146 and CVE-2014-8147.
 

 Root cause of vulnerability:
 - Integer overflow in the resolveImplicitLevels function of ubidi.c due to inconsistent data type assignment (int32 to int16)
 - Heap-based buffer overflow in the resolveImplicitLevels function of ubidi.c due to incorrect tracking of directionally isolated text
 

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
 - Integer overflow
 - Heap-based buffer overflow
 

 Impact of exploitation:
 - Denial of service due to an incorrect malloc followed by an invalid free or a heap-based buffer overflow
 - Potential for arbitrary code execution due to the overflows.
 

 Attack vectors:
 - Exploitable via crafted text input processed by the ICU library
 

 Required attacker capabilities/position:
 - The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted text input that is processed by the vulnerable code
 

 Additional details:
 - The vulnerabilities exist in ICU versions 52 through 54.
 - These vulnerabilities are related to the handling of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

 RELATED: This document mentions both CVE-2014-8146 and CVE-2014-8147
 

 Root cause of vulnerability:
 - The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation does not properly track directionally isolated pieces of text (CVE-2014-8146)
 - The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation uses an integer data type that is inconsistent with a header file (CVE-2014-8147)
 

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
 - Heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2014-8146)
 - Integer overflow (CVE-2014-8147)
 

 Impact of exploitation:
 - Denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow or incorrect malloc followed by invalid free)
 - Possibility of arbitrary code execution
 

 Attack vectors:
 - Remote attackers can exploit this via crafted text
 

 Required attacker capabilities/position:
 - Remote attacker capable of providing crafted text
 

 Additional details:
 - These vulnerabilities were discovered in the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library.
 - Provides fix versions for oldstable, stable, testing and unstable distributions.

 RELATED: This document mentions both CVE-2014-8146 and CVE-2014-8147
 

 Root cause of vulnerability:
 - Heap-based buffer overflow in the `resolveImplicitLevels` function of ubidi.c.
 - Integer overflow in the `resolveImplicitLevels` function of ubidi.c, due to assignment of an `int32` value to an `int16` type.
 

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
 - Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
 - Integer overflow or wraparound (CWE-190)
 

 Impact of exploitation:
 - Denial of service
 - Possibility of code execution
 

 Attack vectors:
 - An attacker provides input that triggers the overflow vulnerabilities
 

 Required attacker capabilities/position:
 - Attacker needs to provide input to a system using the vulnerable ICU library
 

 Additional details:
 - Affects ICU4C library versions 52 through 54.
 - Provides reference to Pedro Ribeiro's disclosure.

 RELATED: This document mentions both CVE-2014-8146 and CVE-2014-8147
 

 Root cause of vulnerability:
 - Heap overflow due to incorrect tracking of isolated text segments.
 - Integer overflow due to type mismatch between `int32_t` and `int16_t` in the `resolveImplicitLevels` function.
 

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:
 - Heap buffer overflow
 - Integer overflow
 

 Impact of exploitation:
 - Potential for arbitrary code execution
 - Denial of service (implied from "errors when performing malloc")
 

 Attack vectors:
 - Exploitable by processing specially crafted input
 

 Required attacker capabilities/position:
 - An attacker must be able to provide a crafted input
 

 Additional details:
 - The vulnerabilities are in the ICU library.
 - Versions 52 to 54 are confirmed to be affected.
 - Upgrade to ICU 55.1 to fix these.
 - Unclear if these vulnerabilities are exploitable in practice.
 - Refers to a PoC for further details.
