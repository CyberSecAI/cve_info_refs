Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-8687:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause lies in the insecure implementation of session management within the Seagate Business NAS web application. Specifically, the application uses a static XOR key for encrypting CodeIgniter session cookies across all instances of the device. This allows an attacker to decrypt, modify, and re-encrypt these cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Static Encryption Key:** The most critical weakness is the use of the same XOR key ('0f0a000d02011f0248000d290d0b0b0e03010e07') for all devices. This allows for universal decryption and modification of session cookies.
2.  **Insecure Session Cookie Handling:** The application uses a serialized PHP array within the session cookie to store user-related information (username, admin status, language). Modifying the 'is_admin' field within the cookie allows privilege escalation.
3.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The 'language' parameter in the session cookie is used to construct a file path for inclusion using PHP's `include()` function. The application doesn't properly sanitize or validate this parameter, leading to LFI.  A null byte injection vulnerability in older PHP versions (prior to 5.3.4) can be exploited to truncate the file path and include arbitrary files.
4.  **Lack of Server-Side Session Validation:** The application primarily relies on the information contained within the client-side cookie for authentication and authorization, with no server-side validation of session details after the initial establishment.
5.  **Outdated Software:** The NAS devices use outdated versions of PHP (5.2.13), CodeIgniter (2.1.0), and Lighttpd (1.4.28), all of which have known security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can leverage the LFI vulnerability and inject malicious PHP code for execution on the device with root privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** RCE allows an attacker to gain complete control over the device, including access to all data and the ability to modify system configurations.
*   **Data Breach:** The NAS devices store user credentials (including potentially reused domain credentials) as DES hashes in the `/etc/shadow` file. These can be easily cracked, which may lead to further compromises.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges to administrative access by simply modifying the 'is_admin' field in the session cookie.
*   **Bypassing Authentication:** By manipulating the session cookie and setting the username, an attacker can completely bypass the normal login mechanism.
*   **Cross-Instance Vulnerability:** Due to the static encryption key, once an attacker obtains a valid session cookie from one instance, they can use that cookie to gain the same level of access on any other vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** All attacks are carried out by crafting malicious HTTP requests to the NAS device's web interface.
*   **Session Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to capture and modify the `ci_session` cookie.
*   **Local File Inclusion:** The 'language' parameter is manipulated to include attacker-controlled files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the vulnerable device, though this can be public internet access in many cases.
*   **Knowledge of XOR Key:** The attacker needs to know the static XOR key used to encrypt the session cookies, which is publicly known for these devices.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be capable of crafting specific HTTP requests with modified session cookies.
*   **Basic understanding of PHP:** To inject malicious php code for execution

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit involves a multi-step process including obtaining a session cookie, decrypting it, modifying it for admin access, then exploiting the LFI vulnerability to gain code execution.
*   Both a Metasploit module and a standalone Python script exist to automate this exploitation process.
*   The vulnerability affects Seagate Business NAS devices running firmware versions up to and including 2014.00319 (and likely earlier).
*   Patches were released by Seagate in April 2015.
