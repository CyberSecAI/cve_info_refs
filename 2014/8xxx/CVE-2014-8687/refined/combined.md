# =======
# Seagate Business NAS pre-authentication remote code execution
# exploit as root user.
#
# by OJ Reeves (@TheColonial) - for full details please see
# https://beyondbinary.io/advisory/seagate-nas-rce/
#
# Usage
# =====
# seagape.py <ip> <port> [-c [ua]]
#
# - ip   : ip or host name of the target NAS
# - port : port of the admin web ui
# - -c   : (optional) create a cookie which will give admin access.
#          Not specifying this flag results in webshell installation.
# - ua   : (optional) the user agent used by the browser for the
#          admin session (UA must match the target browser).
#          Default value is listed below
#
# Example
# =======
# Install and interact with the web shell:
# seagape.py 192.168.0.1 80
#
# Create admin cookie
# seagape.py 192.168.0.1 80 -c

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

        Some Seagate Business NAS devices are vulnerable to command execution via a local

        session cookie. The vulnerability manifests in the way the language files are
        included in the code on the login page, and hence is open to attack from users
        without the need for authentication. The cookie can be easily decrypted using a
        known static encryption key and re-encrypted once the PHP object string has been

##### About The Exploit Database

Ã

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as âGoogle Hackingâ was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnnyâs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term âGoogledorkâ to refer
to âa foolish or inept person as revealed by Googleâ. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a âGoogle problemâ but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term âdorkâ became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and âdorksâ were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Advisory: Seagate NAS Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

[Advisory](/tags/advisory/)
[CVE](/tags/cve/)
[Exploit](/tags/exploit/)
[Seagate](/tags/seagate/)
## Overview

[Seagate](http://www.seagate.com/) is a well-known vendor of hardware solutions, with products available worldwide. Its line of [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage) products targeted at businesses is called [Business Storage 2-Bay NAS](http://www.seagate.com/au/en/support/external-hard-drives/network-storage/business-storage-2-bay-nas/). These can be found inside home and business networks, and in many cases they are publicly exposed.

Products in this line that run firmware versions up to and including version 2014.00319 were found to be vulnerable to a number of issues that allow for remote code execution under the context of the root user. These vulnerabilities are exploitable without requiring any form of authorisation on the device.

## Updates

This document was updated on 11th June 2015 to include links to the released firmware that attempts to address the issues in this advisory.

## Vulnerability Details

Seagate Business NAS products come with a web-enabled management application. This application lets administrators perform the usual device configuration functions, such as adding users, setting up access control, managing files, and more.

The web application is built with the following core technologies:

* PHP version 5.2.13 ([Released 25th February 2010](http://php.net/releases/5_2_13.php))
* CodeIgniter 2.1.0 ([Released 23rd November 2011](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/releases/tag/v2.1.0))
* Lighttpd 1.4.28 ([Released 22nd August 2010](http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Release-1_4_28))

All three of these technologies are clearly out of date, and the listed versions of PHP and CodeIgniter are known to have security issues. On top of these technologies sits a custom PHP application, which itself contains a number of security-related issues. Details of each key issue are listed below.

### PHP 5.2.3

Versions of PHP prior to 5.3.4 allow users to specify file paths that include a NULL byte ([CVE-2006-7243](http://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2006-7243/)). This issue allows user-controlled data to prematurely terminate file paths, allowing for full control over the file extension.

This issue is regularly abused to include unintended files in PHP source code via functions such as `require()` and `include()`.

### CodeIgniter 2.1.0

Versions of CodeIgniter prior to 2.2.0 create session tokens that are made up of a serialised PHP associative array (hash) that has been encrypted using a custom algorithm. This PHP hash contains user-controllable data, which makes it possible for users to [extract the encryption key](https://www.mehmetince.net/codeigniter-object-injection-vulnerability-via-encryption-key/) and decrypt the content of the cookie ([CVE-2014-8686](https://www.dionach.com/blog/codeigniter-session-decoding-vulnerability)). Once decrypted, users can modify the content of the cookie and re-encrypt it prior to submitting it back to the server, resulting in other potential attack vectors including PHP object injection.

A unique encryption key value should be used for each installation of a CodeIgniter application. However, in the case of this line of NAS products, the encryption key that is used is exactly the same for every instance ([CVE-2014-8687](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8687)).

### Custom web application

The custom web application does not appear to maintain session-related information on the web server side. All of the information relevant to a user session is stored inside the session cookie prior to it being encrypted and sent to the browser. The PHP hash inside the cookie contains a number of key/value entries, including the following:

* `username`: this is a string value that represents the name of the user in the current session.
* `is_admin`: this is a string value that can be set to `yes` or `no`, and indicates whether the current user is an administrator on the NAS.
* `language`: this is a string value that represents the current userâs chosen language (eg. `en_US`).

Once a session has been established and the `username` field is present in the cookie, the system does no further validation of user credentials. This means that if a user can manipulate this value directly, instead of attempting to log in the standard way, they can bypass the login mechanism completely.

Direct modification (or addition) of the `is_admin` value allows a user to self-elevate to administrative privileges in the web application itself.

The fact that a static session encryption key is in use across all instances of the NAS means that once a user has a valid session cookie on one instance, they can apply that same cookie directly to another instance and acquire the same level of access. In short, once a user is logged in as `admin` on one instance, theyâre effectively `admin` on every instance.

The `language` parameter is used to generate a file path that is referenced in the web application PHP code via a call to `include()`. Manipulation of this parameter allows for exploitation of a local file inclusion vulnerability.

Finally, the web application is being served by an instance of Lighttpd that is running under the context of the `root` user. Hence, any successful exploitation results in activities being conducted as `root`.

## Affected versions

Two versions of the NAS firmware were tested and shown to be vulnerable. Those versions were:

* 2014.00319
* 2013.60311

At the time of writing, it is believed that all versions prior to 2014.00319 are highly likely to contain the same vulnerabilities.

## CVE Identifiers

This advisory makes use of prior work referenced in the following CVEs:

* [CVE-2014-8684](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/54): timing attacks and object injection.
* [CVE-2014-8686](https://www.dionach.com/blog/codeigniter-session-decoding-vulnerability): a fall-back to the `_xor_encode()` method of session encryption.

The vulnerability discovered via the reuse of the session cookie encryption key was allocated the identifier [CVE-2014-8687](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8687) by MITRE.

## Exploitation

It is simple to exploit the issues listed above to gain arbitrary code execution on the device as the `root` user. The key steps required to achieve this are:

* The attacker must write PHP code to the file system on the NAS. This can be done in several ways, including:
  1. HTTP access log file poisoning via the `User-Agent` header.
  2. HTTP error log file poisoning via the `Host` header.
  3. Modifying the device description in the web application interface. This writes user-controlled strings to a file located at `/etc/devicedesc`, however it does require administrative rights.
  4. Uploading of files to a file share that the device has exposed.
* The attacker must then manipulate the content of the `language` variable in the session cookie so that it contains the path to the attacker-controlled PHP on the file system. The NULL byte flaw in PHP must be used at the end of this value to force PHP to ignore any characters that are appended to the file path by the web application.
* The attacker then makes a request with the manipulated cookie, resulting in code execution as `root`.

Beyond Binary has produced a Metasploit module and a standalone Python script that automate the process of exploitation. Each of these scripts take the following approach:

1. Connects to the target NAS and extracts a `ci_session` cookie.
2. Decrypts the cookie using the static encryption key of `0f0a000d02011f0248000d290d0b0b0e03010e07` and extracts the PHP hash.
3. Modifies the serialised PHP hash so that the `username` is set to `admin` and the `is_admin` field is set to `yes`.
4. Encrypts this updated PHP hash ready for further use as a `ci_session` cookie. This cookie now allows future requests to operate on the NAS as if they were an administrator.
5. Performs a request to extract the host configuration, which includes the deviceâs description.
6. Modifies the host configuration so that the device description contains a small stager payload.
7. Performs a request to update the host configuration with the new data so that the stager payload is written to `/etc/devicedesc`.
8. Modifies the PHP hash again so that the `language` parameter contains the value `../../../../etc/devicedesc\x00` (note the NULL byte at the end).
9. Encrypts this new PHP hash ready for future use as a `ci_session` cookie.
10. Performs a request to the NAS using the cookie created in the previous step. This invokes the stager that was written to disk. This request posts a larger payload which is written to disk under the web server root.
11. Performs another request which then resets the host configuration back to what it was prior to exploitation.

From here, the final stage of the exploit is on-disk and ready to be executed. In the case of the Metasploit module, the final stage is a self-deleting file that contains whichever payload was chosen by the user. In the case of the standalone Python script, the final stage is a simple web shell which is continually referenced for each executed command, and is removed when the Python script is closed.

The exploits are available for download here:

* [Metasploit module](/exploits/bbsec001/seagate_nas_php_exec_noauth.rb) (or on [Github](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/linux/http/seagate_nas_php_exec_noauth.rb)).
* [Python script](/exploits/bbsec001/seagate_nas_php_exec_noauth.py) (or on [Exploit DB](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36202/)).

The following image shows a sample run of the Metasploit module:

![Metasploit module sample run](/images/bbsec001/msf-sample-run.png)

## Remediation

At the time of writing there is no firmware version available for download that contains fixes for the issues listed in this advisory. It is recommended that consumers of these Seagate Business NAS products (and other products using vulnerable firmware) ensure that devices are not accessible via the public Internet. For internal use, it is recommended that the devices be located behind a firewall configured to allow only a trusted set of IP addresses to connect to the web interface.

**Edit: 11th June 2015**

During April 2015 Seagate released [firmware](http://www.seagate.com/au/en/support/downloads/item/business-nas-4bay-firmware-master-dl/) that attempts to resolve these issues. Please see the timeline below.

## Exposure

At the time of writing, [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) reports that there are over 2,500 publicly exposed devices on the Internet that are likely to be vulnerable.

## Potential Ramifications

It appears that the NAS products do not integrate with the likes of Active Directory or LDAP. As a result, they need to store passwords for any users that require access. Passwords are hashed using DES and stored in the `/etc/shadow` file.

Instances of the NAS housed inside an organisation are likely to contain passwords that are reused by domain users. The DES hashes are very easy to crack, and hence an attacker could easily acquire domain credentials once the NAS has been compromised.

## Notes

Initial attempts to disclose the above issues to the vendor proved time consuming and unproductive. Staff on the front-line support team repeatedly failed to direct the query to the relevant point of contact. In light of this, a direct security contact was identified using open intelligence, and front-line support was bypassed. This employee handled the query professionally andÂ demonstrated a high level of concern in the early stages.

#### [TTP: Domain Fronting with Metasploit and Meterpreter](/articles/domain-fronting-with-metasploit-and-meterpreter/)

Though it isn't widely known, support for Domain Fronting was added to Metasploit and Meterpreter by OJ Reeves in late 2017. Part of the reason that it's not common knowledge is the lack of documentation or discussion around how to use it. As a result, we decided to create this post so that users of Metasploit have a decent guide on how to configure and use Domain Fronting over HTTPS with a legitimate certificate.

[01 August 2017:](https://twitter.com/BeyondBase2/status/892362430881214464)Some cloud-based email protection mechanisms are useful. But donât rely on them, they can and will be bypassed without much effort!
