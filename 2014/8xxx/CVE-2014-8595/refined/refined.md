Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-8595 from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **missing privilege level checks** in the x86 emulation of far branch instructions (CALL, JMP, and RETF). These instructions are used for transferring control to different code segments.
* The emulator does not properly check the privilege level associated with the target of the far branch instruction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Privilege Checks:**  The x86 emulator in Xen does not adequately verify if a guest operating system (specifically in HVM) is allowed to execute a far branch instruction to the target segment.
*   **Far Branch Emulation Flaw:** When Xen has to emulate far branch instructions it does not correctly enforce privilege level restrictions.  This happens when the far branch instruction is within emulated MMIO space, or during specific circumstances in 32-bit PAE mode, or after an invalid opcode exception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Malicious HVM guest user mode code can elevate its privileges to the guest supervisor mode. This means a normal user process inside a guest virtual machine could gain administrative or kernel-level control.
*   **Guest Crash:** Exploitation can lead to guest virtual machine crashes (denial of service).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Guest Code:** A malicious actor needs to execute code within a guest virtual machine (specifically a HVM guest).
*   **x86 Emulation:** The attack vector relies on the hypervisor's x86 instruction emulation functionality and specifically targets the flawed handling of far branch instructions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **HVM Guest Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code within a Hardware Virtual Machine (HVM) guest.
*   **User-Mode Execution:** The attacker's initial code execution can be in user mode within the guest.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present on x86 systems running Xen versions 3.2.1 and later, including Xen 4.4, 4.3 and 4.2. ARM systems are not vulnerable.
*   Specific scenarios triggering the vulnerability involve:
    *   Far branch instructions with memory operands residing in emulated or passed-through MMIO (Memory-Mapped I/O) space.
    *   Instructions in 32-bit PAE mode that are near page table update operations.
    *   Manipulated instructions following an Invalid Opcode exception.
    *   Guests running in real mode where there are no privilege checks.

**Mitigations (from Xen advisory):**

*   Running only PV (Paravirtualized) guests will avoid this issue.

**Patches:**

* Patches were released by Xen Project to address the vulnerability.
* Specific patches for Xen 4.4.x, 4.3.x, and 4.2.x are referenced.

**Summary**
CVE-2014-8595 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Xen's x86 emulation. It occurs due to missing privilege level checks when emulating far branch instructions. A malicious user-mode process within an HVM guest can exploit this to gain higher privileges or crash the guest. Patches are available to mitigate this vulnerability.
