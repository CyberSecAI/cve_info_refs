Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8637:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the BMP decoder handles image data within a `<canvas>` element. Specifically, when a malformed BMP image is rendered, the memory used for the image data is not always properly initialized. This leads to the use of uninitialized memory during the rendering process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Uninitialized Memory:** The core issue is that the BMP decoder does not always initialize the memory used for image data before rendering it to a `<canvas>`. This can lead to unpredictable values being used in the rendering process.
*   **Data Leakage:** Because the memory is uninitialized, it can contain data from previous operations, potentially leaking sensitive information to the web content.
*   **Format Confusion:**  The issue is exacerbated by inconsistent handling of image formats (B8G8R8A8 vs B8G8R8X8), which can lead to drawing paths that assume correctly initialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary risk is the leakage of potentially sensitive data from uninitialized memory to web content.
*  **Unpredictable Rendering:** The use of uninitialized memory can lead to unpredictable results when rendering the image.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious BMP Image:** An attacker can craft a specially malformed BMP image that triggers the vulnerability in the decoder.
*   **`<canvas>` Element:** The vulnerability is specifically related to how malformed BMP images are rendered within a `<canvas>` element in the browser.
*   **User Interaction:** An attacker needs to entice a user to load a webpage containing the malformed BMP image, typically through social engineering or by hosting a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malformed BMP Images:** The attacker needs to create BMP images that trigger the uninitialized memory use.
*   **Web Presence:** The attacker needs the ability to host the malformed BMP image in a webpage for a victim to load.
*   **User Enticement:** The attacker needs to entice a user to load the malicious webpage.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported as a security issue with a "sec-high" rating, but was later downgraded as it was determined to be a case of inconsistent rendering rather than direct data leakage.
*   The bug report ([bug 1094536](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1094536)) contains detailed discussions about the cause and attempts to fix it. The fix was initially thought to be in bug 1063129, but that was determined not to be the complete fix. The original bug was marked as `WONTFIX` and closed, meaning no further work was intended on it.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 35, and SeaMonkey 2.32.
*   The vulnerability is also referenced in multiple security advisories for openSUSE and SUSE Linux.
*   The Secunia Research team identified this as uninitialized memory use during bitmap rendering.

In summary, CVE-2014-8637 is a vulnerability arising from the improper handling of malformed BMP images in the `<canvas>` element. This could lead to information disclosure and inconsistent rendering of images and it is fixed in Firefox 35 and Seamonkey 2.32.
