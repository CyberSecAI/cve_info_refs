Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2014-8778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a bypass in the Checkmarx CxQL sandbox. CxQL is a C#-based language used for querying source code within the Checkmarx suite. The sandbox was intended to restrict access to critical C# classes/functions for security reasons. However, this restriction could be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass the intended restrictions of the CxQL sandbox. Specifically, the vulnerability allows for the execution of arbitrary and unauthorized C# code, which was not intended or permitted by the sandbox restrictions. This was achieved by using `(new System.Net.WebPermission(System.Security.Permissions.PermissionState.Unrestricted)).Assert();` and `(new System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission(System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.AllFlags)).Assert();` to elevate privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
  - **Compromise of Machines**: An attacker can execute arbitrary C# code, which would allow them to gain control of the machine on which the code is executed. This could be a Checkmarx server or an auditor's workstation.
  - **Control of Workstations:** Auditors with access to the CxAudit interface can take control of their workstations.
  - **Control of Checkmarx Servers**: Checkmarx administrators with access to the Checkmarx web interface can take control of the Checkmarx enterprise server and CxAudit workstations by injecting malicious code into default queries.
  - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary C# code on the affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - **Malicious CxQL Queries:** An attacker can inject malicious C# code into CxQL queries, either remotely through the web interface or locally through CxAudit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - **Auditor Access:** An attacker with access to the CxAudit interface to execute custom queries.
  - **Checkmarx Admin Access:** An attacker with Checkmarx administrator privileges and access to the web interface for creating queries.

**Technical Details:**
The following techniques were used to bypass the sandbox:

1.  **Establishing Network Connection:**
    *   Normally, CxQL does not allow network connections. The code `System.Net.WebRequest.Create("<http://deloitte.fr">;);` would fail.
    *   The bypass was achieved by adding the following line of code before attempting the network connection:  `(new System.Net.WebPermission(System.Security.Permissions.PermissionState.Unrestricted)).Assert();`

2. **Executing System Commands:**
   *   Normally, CxQL would crash or fail when attempting to execute commands like `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("calc");`
   *   The bypass was achieved by adding the following line before the command execution: `(new System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermission(System.Security.Permissions.SecurityPermissionFlag.AllFlags)).Assert();`
