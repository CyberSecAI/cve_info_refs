It does not detect changes due to collisions and stamps a copy of the first instance of the collision over future instances.\n\nA chosen-prefix attack is trivial due to the 64-bit hash, so for example you could make inode structures collide in a VM backup. Applications compiled against librsync will likely need recompiling after the patch ships, since RS_DEFAULT_STRONG_LEN will have to change. \n\nExploits are public:\n<https://github.com/therealmik/librsync-collision>\n\nFixed upstream in librsync 1.0.0 by introducing a backward-incompatible change that replaces MD4 hash with BLAKE2 by default. It is still possible to enable use of MD4 for compatibility. \n\nTo mitigate this issue, signatures will by default be computed with a 256-bit BLAKE2 hash. Old versions of librsync will complain about a bad magic number when given these signature files.\n\nBackward compatibility can be obtained using the new\n`rdiff sig --hash=md4` option or through specifying the \"signature magic\" in the API, but this should not be used when either the old or new file contain untrusted data.\n\nDeltas generated from those signatures will also use BLAKE2 during generation, but produce output that can be read by old versions."
