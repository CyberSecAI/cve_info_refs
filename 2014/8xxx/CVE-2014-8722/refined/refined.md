Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-8722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure storage and disclosure of sensitive information within the Pluck CMS application. Specifically, the application stores user password hashes (SHA1), salts, and API keys in XML files that are directly accessible via web URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** User passwords (SHA1 hashes), salts, and API keys are exposed in publicly accessible XML files.
    *   `/GetSimpleCMS/data/users/.xml`
    *   `/GetSimpleCMS/backups/users/.xml.bak`
    *   `/GetSimpleCMS/data/other/authorization.xml`
    *   `/GetSimpleCMS/data/other/appid.xml`
2.  **API Vulnerabilities:** The exposed API key can be used to make unauthorized requests to the site's API, allowing:
    *   Discovery of usernames.
    *   Reading user settings files (including password hashes).
    *   Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Exposure of password hashes, salts, and API keys can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts and the CMS administrative interface.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can access sensitive user data stored within the CMS.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Through the exposed API key, attackers can read sensitive data and gain complete control over the application including local file inclusion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable XML files by knowing the specific URLs.
*   **API Exploitation:** Attackers can use the leaked API key to make malicious requests to the API endpoint (`/GetSimpleCMS/admin/api.php`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to know or discover the URLs where the sensitive information is stored.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate or have any specific privileges before accessing the vulnerable URLs.
*   For API exploitation, the attacker needs to obtain the API key from the exposed XML file.

**Additional Information:**

* The provided content gives more detail than the typical CVE description by specifying the exact vulnerable URLs and API attack vectors.
* This vulnerability affects GetSimpleCMS version 3.3.4.
