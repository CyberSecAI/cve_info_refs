How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for curl
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2015:0248-1
Rating: moderate
References: #901924 #911363
Cross-References: CVE-2014-3707 CVE-2014-8150
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
openSUSE 13.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
was updated to version 7.40.0 to fix two security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2014-8150: CRLF injection vulnerability in libcurl 6.0 through 7.x
before 7.40.0, when using an HTTP proxy, allowed remote attackers to
inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting
attacks via CRLF sequences in a URL (bnc#911363).
- CVE-2014-3707: The curl\_easy\_duphandle function in libcurl 7.17.1
through 7.38.0, when running with the CURLOPT\_COPYPOSTFIELDS option, did
not properly copy HTTP POST data for an easy handle, which triggered an
out-of-bounds read that allowed remote web servers to read sensitive
memory information (bnc#901924).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- http\_digest: Added support for Windows SSPI based authentication
- version info: Added Kerberos V5 to the supported features
- Makefile: Added VC targets for WinIDN
- SSL: Add PEM format support for public key pinning
- smtp: Added support for the conversion of Unix newlines during mail send
- smb: Added initial support for the SMB/CIFS protocol
- Added support for HTTP over unix domain sockets,
- via CURLOPT\_UNIX\_SOCKET\_PATH and --unix-socket
- sasl: Added support for GSS-API based Kerberos V5 authentication
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-125=1

Package        : curl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-8150

Andrey Labunets of Facebook discovered that cURL, an URL transfer
library, fails to properly handle URLs with embedded end-of-line
characters. An attacker able to make an application using libcurl to
access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP proxy could use this flaw to
do additional requests in a way that was not intended, or insert
additional request headers into the request.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy12.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.38.0-4.

We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

## Oracle Linux Bulletin - October 2015

### Description

The Oracle Linux Bulletin lists all CVEs that had been resolved and announced in Oracle Linux Security Advisories (ELSA) in the last one month prior to the release of the bulletin. Oracle Linux Bulletins are published on the same day as Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e., the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates) to cover all CVEs that had been resolved in those two months following the bulletin's publication. In addition, Oracle Linux Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next scheduled bulletin publication date.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Oracle Linux Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see ULN Advisory [http://linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin](//linux.oracle.com/ol-pad-bulletin)

### Oracle Linux Bulletin Schedule

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14985#c0)  David Walser    2015-01-08 17:54:41 CET  ``` Upstream has issued an advisory today (January 8): <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108B.html>  The issue is fixed upstream in 7.40.0 (freeze push requested for Cauldron) and there's a patch available.  Note: 7.40.0 also fixes CVE-2014-8151, which only affects Mac OS X and iOS.  Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 4.  Advisory: ========================  Updated curl packages fix security vulnerability:  When libcurl sends a request to a server via a HTTP proxy, it copies the entire URL into the request and sends if off. If the given URL contains line feeds and carriage returns those will be sent along to the proxy too, which allows the program to for example send a separate HTTP request injected embedded in the URL (CVE-2014-8150).

## Updated curl packages fix CVE-2014-8150

Publication date: 09 Jan 2015

Modification date: 09 Jan 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-8150](CVE-2014-8150.html)

## Description

```
Updated curl packages fix security vulnerability:

When libcurl sends a request to a server via a HTTP proxy, it copies the
entire URL into the request and sends if off. If the given URL contains line
feeds and carriage returns those will be sent along to the proxy too, which
allows the program to for example send a separate HTTP request injected
embedded in the URL (CVE-2014-8150).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to: [Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of malicious exploitation of vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that malicious attackers have been successful because customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 270 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at [https://blogs.oracle.com/security](//blogs.oracle.com/security).

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see  [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html) .

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review previous  [Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update October 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 2037108.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2037108.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 25 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

## Topic

Updated curl packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add two enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for
downloading files from servers using various protocols, including HTTP,
FTP, and LDAP.

It was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial
literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker able
to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use this flaw
to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other cookie-related
issues easier to exploit. (CVE-2014-3613)

A flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the duplication
of connection handles. If an application set the CURLOPT\_COPYPOSTFIELDS
option for a handle, using the handle's duplicate could cause the
application to crash or disclose a portion of its memory. (CVE-2014-3707)

It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle URLs
with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an
application using libcurl to access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP
proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the request or
construct additional requests. (CVE-2014-8150)

It was discovered that libcurl implemented aspects of the NTLM and
Negotatiate authentication incorrectly. If an application uses libcurl
and the affected mechanisms in a specifc way, certain requests to a
previously NTLM-authenticated server could appears as sent by the wrong
authenticated user. Additionally, the initial set of credentials for HTTP
Negotiate-authenticated requests could be reused in subsequent requests,
although a different set of credentials was specified. (CVE-2015-3143,
CVE-2015-3148)

Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these issues.

Bug fixes:

* An out-of-protocol fallback to SSL version 3.0 (SSLv3.0) was available

with libcurl. Attackers could abuse the fallback to force downgrade of the
SSL version. The fallback has been removed from libcurl. Users requiring
this functionality can explicitly enable SSLv3.0 through the libcurl API.
(BZ#1154059)

* A single upload transfer through the FILE protocol opened the destination

file twice. If the inotify kernel subsystem monitored the file, two events
were produced unnecessarily. The file is now opened only once per upload.
(BZ#883002)

* Utilities using libcurl for SCP/SFTP transfers could terminate

unexpectedly when the system was running in FIPS mode. (BZ#1008178)

* Using the "--retry" option with the curl utility could cause curl to

terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now, adding "--retry" no
longer causes curl to crash. (BZ#1009455)

* The "curl --trace-time" command did not use the correct local time when

printing timestamps. Now, "curl --trace-time" works as expected.
(BZ#1120196)

* The valgrind utility could report dynamically allocated memory leaks on

curl exit. Now, curl performs a global shutdown of the NetScape Portable
Runtime (NSPR) library on exit, and valgrind no longer reports the memory
leaks. (BZ#1146528)

* Previously, libcurl returned an incorrect value of the

CURLINFO\_HEADER\_SIZE field when a proxy server appended its own headers to
the HTTP response. Now, the returned value is valid. (BZ#1161163)

Enhancements:

* The "--tlsv1.0", "--tlsv1.1", and "--tlsv1.2" options are available for

specifying the minor version of the TLS protocol to be negotiated by NSS.
The "--tlsv1" option now negotiates the highest version of the TLS protocol
supported by both the client and the server. (BZ#1012136)

* It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable the ECC and the new

AES cipher suites to be used for TLS. (BZ#1058767, BZ#1156422)

All curl users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add these
enhancements.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1213306#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2015-04-20 10:02:14 UTC  ``` libcurl keeps a pool of its last few connections around after use to fascilitate easy, conventient and completely transparent connection re-use for applications.  When doing HTTP requests NTLM authenticated, the entire connnection becomes authenticated and not just the specific HTTP request which is otherwise how HTTP works. This makes NTLM special and a subject for special treatment in the code. With NTLM, once the connection is authenticated, no further authentication is necessary until the connection gets closed.  libcurl's connection re-use logic will select an existing connection for re-use when asked to do a request, and when asked to use NTLM libcurl have to pick a connection with matching credentials only.  If a connection was first setup and used for an NTLM HTTP request with a specific set of credentials, that same connection could later wrongly get re-used in a subsequent HTTP request that was made to the same host - but without having any credentials set! Since an NTLM connection was already authenticated due to how NTLM works, the subsequent request could then get sent over the wrong connection appearing as the initial user.  We are not aware of any exploits of this flaw.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Daniel Stenberg (curl upstream) for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Paras Sethia as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1213306#c1)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-22 07:55:51 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150422A.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1213306#c2)  Martin Prpič    2015-04-22 07:57:40 UTC  ```  Created curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1214184](show_bug.cgi?id=1214184 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3143 curl: re-using authenticated connection when unauthenticated [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1213306#c3)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-04-23 14:31:09 UTC  ```  Created mingw-curl tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1214795](show_bug.cgi?id=1214795 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3143 CVE-2015-3148 CVE-2015-3145 CVE-2015-3144 mingw-curl: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1214796](show_bug.cgi?id=1214796 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2015-3143 CVE-2015-3148 CVE-2015-3145 CVE-2015-3144 mingw-curl: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1213306#c4)  Stefan Cornelius    2015-04-23 14:39:01 UTC  ``` Patch: <http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2015-3143.patch>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1213306#c7)  Huzaifa S.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Assume close to signal end  message. This can lead to infinite loops when e.g. NTLM authentication is required (curl -v -I -L -k -s --ntlm -u ACCOUNT:PASSWORD <https://URL/nonexistent.html>).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  curl-7.19.7-40.el6_6.1.x86_64   How reproducible:  Always  Steps to Reproduce:  1. setup httpd server with KeepAlive On 2. curl -v --head <http://server/nonexistent.html> 3. observe output  Actual results:  ... Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 * no chunk, no close, no size. Assume close to signal end  <  * Closing connection #0   Expected results:  ... Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1  <  * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact * Closing connection #0   Additional info:  Backport patch attached.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1168137#c1)  Kamil Dudka    2014-11-26 09:54:56 UTC  ``` Thanks for the bug report and patch!  upstream commit: <https://github.com/bagder/curl/commit/85ce195f>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1168137#c5)  Kamil Dudka    2014-11-26 14:57:48 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 961541](attachment.cgi?id=961541&action=diff "backport of upstream bug 1124") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=961541&action=edit "backport of upstream bug 1124") backport of upstream [bug 1124](show_bug.cgi?id=1124 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - problem with SIGCHLD signal handling in vixie-cron")  Looks good to me.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1168137#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 05:44:09 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=901924#c0)  Sebastian Krahmer   2014-10-20 14:11:05 UTC  ``` libcurl duphandle read out of bounds ====================================  Project cURL Security Advisory, November 5th 2014 - [Permalink](<http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20141105.html>)  VULNERABILITY -------------  libcurl's function [`curl_easy_duphandle()`](<http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html>) has a bug that can lead to libcurl eventually sending off sensitive data that was not intended for sending.  When doing an HTTP POST transfer with libcurl, you can use the `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` option to specify a memory area holding the data to send to the remote server. The memory area's size is set with a separate option, for example `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE`.  As the name implies, the data in the specified buffer is copied to a privately held memory buffer that libcurl allocates on the heap. The memory area is associated with the common CURL handle, often referred to as an "easy handle".  This handle can be duplicated by an application to create an identical copy, and all the already set options and data is then also similarly cloned and will be associated with the newly returned handle. This also includes the data to send in an HTTP POST request.  The internal libcurl function that duplicates options from the old handle to the new, mistakenly treated the post data buffer as if it was a C string. A C string ends with a zero byte, and subsequently strdup() was used to duplicate the post data buffer. A post data buffer can perfectly legitimately contain a zero byte, or it may not contain any zero byte at all (including no trailing one) - leading to strdup() either making a too small duplicate, a too large one or crash due to reading an inaccessible memory area. The strdup() of course allocates memory off the heap.  If strdup finds a zero before the end of the buffer, the copied string ends up shorter than the original buffer but the original buffer size is still kept around. When libcurl subsequently constructs the HTTP POST request and includes data for the protocol body it will memcpy() data from that new pointer using the old size. This makes a read outside of the allocated boundary and can thus lead to libcurl inserting data into the request that happens to be laid out in the heap memory immediately after the post data buffer.  We are not aware of anyone having been able to actually exploit this for nefarious purposes, but we can't exclude that it is possible or even might already have been exploited.  INFO ----  This bug requires `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` and `curl_easy_duphandle()` to be used in that order, and then the duplicate handle must be used to perform the HTTP POST.  The curl tool is not affected, it does not use this sequence.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2014-XXXX to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  This bug has existed since `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` was introduced.  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.17.1 to and including 7.38.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.39.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.39.0 makes sure that the buffer area is duplicated and presumed to be binary.  A patch for this problem is available at:       <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl-copypostfields-preliminary.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.39.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Avoid using `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS` then `curl_easy_duphandle()`  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on September 16th 2014.  We contacted distros@openwall on October 20.  libcurl 7.39.0 was released on November 5th 2014, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.  CREDITS -------  Reported by Symeon Paraschoudis. Stas Malyshev helped us understand and repeat the problem. Dan Fandrich helped assess the security risk. Patch written by Daniel Stenberg.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

### Patch Availability

Please see My Oracle Support Note [1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=98620971207196&id=1448883.1)

### Third Party Bulletin Schedule

Third Party Bulletins are released on the Tuesday closest to the 17th day of January, April, July and October. The next four dates are:

* 14 April 2015
* 14 July 2015
* 20 October 2015
* 19 January 2016

# USN-2474-1: curl vulnerability

15 January 2015

curl could be tricked into adding arbitrary requests when following certain
URLs.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.10](/security/notices?release=utopic)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [curl](/security/cves?package=curl) - HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP client and client libraries

## Details

Andrey Labunets discovered that curl incorrectly handled certain URLs when

using a proxy server. If a user or automated system were tricked into using

a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly use this issue to

inject arbitrary HTTP requests.

Many programs allow some kind of external sources to set the URL or provide partial pieces for the URL to request, and if the URL (as received from the user) is not stripped good enough - this flaw allows malicious users to do additional requests in a way that was not intended, or to insert request headers into the request that the program didn't intend.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=911363#c0)  Victor Pereira   2014-12-30 08:18:54 UTC  ``` URL request injection vulnerability ===================================  Project cURL Security Advisory, January 8th 2015 - [Permalink](<http://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20150108B.html>)  VULNERABILITY -------------  When libcurl sends a request to a server via a HTTP proxy, it copies the entire URL into the request and sends if off.  If the given URL contains line feeds and carriage returns those will be sent along to the proxy too, which allows the program to for example send a separate HTTP request injected embedded in the URL.  Many programs allow some kind of external sources to set the URL or provide partial pieces for the URL to ask for, and if the URL as received from the user is not stripped good enough this flaw allows malicious users to do additional requests in a way that was not intended, or just to insert request headers into the request that the program didn't intend.  We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.  INFO ----  This flaw can also affect the curl command line tool if a similar operation series is made with that.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name CVE-2015-XXXX to this issue.  AFFECTED VERSIONS -----------------  - Affected versions: from libcurl 7.1 to and including 7.39.0 - Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.40.0  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!  THE SOLUTION ------------  libcurl 7.40.0 makes sure that the URL passed to the proxy may never contain neither carriage returns nor line feeds characters.  A patch for this problem is available (for now) at:       <http://curl.haxx.se/0001-url-parsing-reject-CRLFs-within-URLs.patch>  RECOMMENDATIONS ---------------  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of preference:  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.40.0  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl  C - Only use URLs that are carefully stripped from line feeds and carriage      returns  TIME LINE ---------  It was first reported to the curl project on December 25 2014.  We contacted distros@openwall on December 28.  libcurl 7.40.0 was released on January 8th 2015, coordinated with the publication of this advisory.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
