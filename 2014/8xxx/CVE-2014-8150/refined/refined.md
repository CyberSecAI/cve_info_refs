  "CVE-2014-8150": {
    "description": "libcurl 6.0 through 7.x before 7.40.0, when using an HTTP proxy, allowed remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via CRLF sequences in a URL",
    "affected_versions": [
      "libcurl 6.0 through 7.x before 7.40.0"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The libcurl library fails to properly handle URLs with embedded end-of-line characters. When using an HTTP proxy, it copies the entire URL into the request, including any CRLF sequences. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers or construct additional requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CRLF injection",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks, potentially leading to various exploits, including session hijacking, cross-site scripting, and cache poisoning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network (through HTTP proxy)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the URL provided to an application using libcurl when making requests through an HTTP proxy. This can be achieved by injecting crafted URLs, redirecting users to attacker controlled URLs.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability can affect both client applications and server-side applications using libcurl, if they utilize user-controlled URLs when making requests through a proxy server."
