RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Product Version: libvirt-1.1.1-29.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-rhev-1.5.3-60.el7ev.x86_64  How producible: Always  Steps: 1. Create a qcow3 format volume in default pool # cat qcow3-vol2.xml <volume>   <name>qcow3-vol2</name>   <source>   </source>   <capacity unit='bytes'>1024000000</capacity>   <allocation unit='bytes'>204000</allocation>   <target>     <format type='qcow2'/>     <compat>1.1</compat>     <features>     <lazy_refcounts/>     </features>   </target> </volume>  # virsh vol-create default qcow3-vol2.xml Vol qcow3-vol2 created from qcow3-vol2.xml  # ll /var/lib/libvirt/images/qcow3-vol2 -rw-------. 1 root root 197120 Apr  9  2014 /var/lib/libvirt/images/qcow3-vol2  2. Create a raw format volume in default pool # cat raw.xml <volume> <name>raw</name>   <source>   </source>    <capacity unit='bytes'>589934592</capacity>   <allocation unit='bytes'>56063232</allocation>   <target>     <format type='raw'/>   </target> </volume>  # virsh vol-create default raw.xml Vol raw created from raw.xml  # ll /var/lib/libvirt/images/raw -rw-------. 1 root root 589934592 Apr  9  2014 /var/lib/libvirt/images/raw   3. Download qcow3-vol2 to raw by passing negative integer to offset and length # virsh vol-download --pool default qcow3-vol2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/raw --offset -1 --length -1000  4. check the volume raw # ll /var/lib/libvirt/images/raw -rw-------. 1 root root 197120 Apr  9  2014 /var/lib/libvirt/images/raw  Actual results: in step 3: Successfully download volume to local file  Expected results: in step 3: Virsh command vol-download should return with error like this: error: invalid value for offset and length  Additional Info: In manual page: vol-download [--pool pool-or-uuid] [--offset bytes] [--length bytes]         --offset is the position in the storage volume            at which to start reading the data. --length is an upper bound of            the amount of data to be downloaded.  It is said that offset is the position in the storage volume at which to start reading the data, so I think the value of offset should be no smaller than 0, option length as well.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c2)  John Ferlan    2014-07-15 11:41:06 UTC  ```  There are those that would argue that "-1" could be used to imply the largest value allowed. The libvirt code reads input from virsh generally as an unsigned long long value and then makes decisions based on "expectations" of how the caller wishes to interpret the data.  For "offset" the eventual lseek() allows a -1 value to mean the end of the file, although other negative values are interpreted as their unsigned long long values which generally results in an error since files are generally not that large (yet).  Whether it's realistic to expect copying from the end of the file means anything is left to the interpretation of the user and the implementation of the OS. See the lstat man page for details on -1 for the offset argument.  For "length" a -1 could/should be interpretted as the "whole" file. In your example all 197120 bytes. Other negative values are less obvious, but would be converted to their unsigned long long equivalent and used. In your case -1000 would be more than enough to copy the whole file.  For a short time during May 2014 it seems the use of -1 would have been prohibited due to other changes (listed below) in the underlying code called by the virsh routines (in particular vshCommandOptULongLong()). The following is a bit of history going backwards through time...  For vol-{upload|download} in particular, a change made as a result of the patches restored the ability to use -1 as a pseudonym for everything:  <http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-June/msg00184.html>  Those changes were based on a pass where the vcpuinfo parameter to allow/use -1:  <http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-May/msg01013.html>  was questioned and led to a list of various virsh commands that may or may not want to allow -1:  <http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-May/msg01029.html>  The set of changes was based upon a new API that was developed to handle those -1 special cases based on the following patches:  <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-May/msg00000.html>  which were based on the rejection of:  <http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-April/msg01132.html>  The early May patches would have caused -1 to be rejected as an invalid value, while the later May patches restored the former functionality based on the auditing done of the callers of the API's to convert input values.  I have reopened (with any luck) the discussion surrounding vol-{upload|download} with the upstream community and will see what the thoughts there are.  I personally think an 'offset' of -1 is useless, although a negative value for length does have value to mean everything.  The man page will be adjusted accordingly based on the results of the renewed discussion.  If that doesn't work - I'll send patches which will most certainly cause someone to think about it again   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c3)  John Ferlan    2014-07-17 17:29:44 UTC  ``` Patch sent upstream:  <http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-July/msg00865.html>   Code pushed:  commit 570d0f6387038a6d7651b22fd555de603f07ab3b Author: John Ferlan <jferlan> Date:   Tue Jul 15 08:26:28 2014 -0400      virsh vol-upload/download disallow negative offset          [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1087104](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104 "CLOSED ERRATA - [Storage][vol-download] virsh cmd vol-download works with option offset and length by passing a negative integer")          Commit id 'c6212539' explicitly allowed a negative value to be used for     offset and length as a shorthand for the largest value after commit id     'f18c02ec' modified virStrToLong_ui() to essentially disallow a negative     value.          However, allowing a negative value for offset ONLY worked if the negative     value was -1 since the eventual lseek() does allow a -1 to mean the end     of the file.  Providing other negative values resulted in errors such as:          $ virsh vol-download --pool default qcow3-vol2 /home/vm-images/raw \       --offset -2 --length -1000     error: cannot download from volume qcow3-vol2     error: Unable to seek /home/vm-images/qcow3-vol2 to 18446744073709551614: In          $          Thus, it seems unreasonable to expect or allow a negative value for offset     since the only benefit is to lseek() to the end of the file and then only     take advantage of how the OS would handle such a seek. For the purposes of     upload or download of volume data, that seems to be a no-op.  Therefore,     disallow a negative value for offset.          Additionally, modify the man page for vol-upload and vol-download to provide     more details regarding the valid values for both offset and length.    git describe: v1.2.6-184-g570d0f6   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c5)  Pei Zhang    2014-12-03 06:10:18 UTC  ``` According to the title and content of the patch in [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c3) , and the description of vol-upload / vol-download about --offset ,--length option in the man page : ...... --offset is the position in the storage volume at which to start writing the data. The value must be 0 or larger --length is an upper bound of the amount of data to be uploaded. A negative value is interpreted as an unsigned long long value to essentially include everything from the offset to the end of the volume.  ......   verifying it as following steps , it seems that it doesn't work well for vol-upload :  steps: 1>  try to do vol-upload with a negative value of --offset as -1 and --length as -1 , upload successfully  # virsh vol-upload --pool default --vol vol1.xml uploadfile --offset -1 --length -1  2> try to do vol-upload with a negative value of --offset as -1 and --length as -10000 , upload successfully # virsh vol-upload --pool default --vol vol1.xml uploadfile --offset -1 --length -10000  3> try to do vol-upload with a negative value of --offset as -2 and --length as -1 , fail to upload , give error message .  # virsh vol-upload --pool default --vol vol1.xml uploadfile --offset -2 --length -1 error: cannot upload to volume vol1.xml error: End of file while reading data: Input/output error error: Failed to reconnect to the hypervisor  4> try to do vol-upload with a negative value of --offset as -1000 and --length as -1000 , fail to upload , give error message .  # virsh vol-upload --pool default --vol vol1.xml uploadfile --offset -1000 --length -1000 error: cannot upload to volume vol1.xml error: End of file while reading data: Input/output error error: Failed to reconnect to the hypervisor  5>try to do vol-download with a negative value of --offset  and --length , unable to parse offset value  # virsh vol-download --pool default --vol vol1.xml downloadfile --offset -2 --length -1 error: Unable to parse offset value  # virsh vol-download --pool default --vol vol1.xml downloadfile --offset -1 --length -1 error: Unable to parse offset value   As above ,for command vol-upload in the step 1 and step 2 , if the negative value of offset is -1 , it will be wrapped the largest value then upload successfully. in the step 3 and step 4 , using another negative value which is not -1 , fail to upload and it  will give a confused error message. should it use the same error handling as well as vol-download .  thanks.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c6)  John Ferlan    2014-12-03 12:22:10 UTC  ``` yes - although it's been 5 months since I made the change and I have no recollection how I forgot the -upload check as well even though I mentioned it in the commit (sigh!)... Must've been the myopia and short term memory loss.

Thanks a lot .   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c10)  John Ferlan    2014-12-23 13:47:32 UTC  ``` From the aspect of whether the bug described is fixed - I would say, sure this is verified (e.g. -1 as offset results in failures).  From the aspect of whether the *1614, *1615, and *1616 work - I think perhaps a new bug report should be created and tracked separately, but be sure it gets the rhel-7.2.0 flag (not 7.1.0).  The *1615 value is also known as UINT64_MAX and it's worth the time to chase into the code to see if that magic value has special meaning...  It might end up being nothing but the *equivalent* of passing -1 to *seek to indicate "the whole file" or "the end of the file".   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c11)  Pei Zhang    2014-12-25 08:20:58 UTC  ``` Thanks for your response .  According to [comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c9) and [comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c10) , move this bug to verified . A new bug to trace "too large" value issue . [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1177219](show_bug.cgi?id=1177219 "CLOSED ERRATA - [Storage] vol-download / upload works well with an offset which was \"too large\"")   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1087104#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-03-05 07:33:59 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=909274#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-12-10 14:29:15 UTC  ``` rh#1172569  When user doesn't have read access on one of the domains he requested, the for loop in qemuConnectGetAllDomainStats() could exit abruptly or continue and override pointer which pointed to locked object.  With certain configuration, this can either cause a deadlock (it leaves a domain locked) or a segmentation fault when domain object has its reference counter decremented when it was not incremented.  With certain configuration, a remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to caus denial of service condition or crash libvirtd.  Introduced by:  <http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=d1bde8ed> <http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=1f4831ee>  Upstream patch: <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2014-December/msg00551.html>   References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1172569> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-8131> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-8131> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=909274#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-12-10 23:00:49 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=909274#c2)  Alexander Bergmann   2014-12-17 11:56:47 UTC  ``` Looks like the whole bulk stats API stuff is quite new.

No SLE products affected.  > On the openSUSE side its only openSUSE:13.2 that's affected by this.  13.2 and tumbleweed.  The latter is fixed by the recent update to 1.2.11.  I've backported fixes for 13.2 and have them queued in Virtualization:openSUSE13.2/libvirt.  But before submitting a maintenancereq, I need to look into a report about libvirtd segfaulting when creating Xen PV domains. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=909274#c4)  James Fehlig   2014-12-18 02:36:15 UTC  ``` Forgot to add Jason.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Libvirt Security Notice: LSN-2014-0009

## crash when using virStorageVolUpload

### Lifecycle

| Reported on: | 20141202 |
| --- | --- |
| Published on: | 20141203 |
| Fixed on: | 20141203 |

### Credits

| Reported by: | Pei Zhang |
| --- | --- |
| Patched by: | Luyao Huang |

### See also

* CVE-2014-8135

### Description

Incorrect parameter validation of the virStorageVolUpload
command could cause libvirtd to attempt to dereference NULL.

### Impact

When using fine-grained ACLs, a user that is permitted to
modify storage volumes but not create arbitrary domains can use bogus
parameters to cause a denial of service attack against more privileged
users.

### Workaround

Passing valid parameters to virStorageVolUpload will not
trigger a problem. It is also possible to prevent the denial of
service by stopping the use of the fine grained access control
mechanism, or by not granting users the storage\_vol:data\_write
permission if they do not also have the domain:write permission; doing
this will not prevent the crash for invalid parameters, but such a
crash is no longer a security attack.
