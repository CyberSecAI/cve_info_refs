{
  "CVE-2014-8136": {
    "description": "The (1) qemuDomainMigratePerform and (2) qemuDomainMigrateFinish2 functions in qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt do not unlock the domain when an ACL check fails, which allow local users to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors.",
    "root_cause": "The qemuDomainMigratePerform and qemuDomainMigrateFinish2 functions in libvirt do not properly unlock a domain when an ACL check fails during migration.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper domain unlock upon failed ACL check"
    ],
    "impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service by locking a domain, potentially of a more privileged user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By exploiting a read-only connection to libvirtd.",
      "Local users using virsh with a crafted offset or by failing an ACL check"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a read-only connection to libvirtd, or local access to the system.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability can lead to a deadlock if a domain is locked and left locked or a segmentation fault if the domain object's reference counter is decremented without being incremented. A similar vulnerability exists in storage_driver.c(CVE-2014-8135) where the function storageVolUpload does not check return values, which could lead to a crash. An attacker could exploit this using virsh vol-upload with a crafted offset value."
