Subject: [OSSA 2014-023] Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Horizon (CVE-2014-3473,
 CVE-2014-3474, and CVE-2014-3475)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-023
CVE: CVE-2014-3473, CVE-2014-3474, and CVE-2014-3475
Date: July 08, 2014
Title: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities in Horizon
Reporter: Jason Hullinger (HP)    - CVE-2014-3473
          Craig Lorentzen (Cisco) - CVE-2014-3474
          Michael Xin (Rackspace) - CVE-2014-3475
Products: Horizon
Versions: up to 2013.2.3, and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1

Description:
Jason Hullinger from Hewlett Packard, Craig Lorentzen from Cisco and
Michael Xin from Rackspace reported 3 cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerabilities in Horizon. A malicious Orchestration template owner or
catalog may conduct an XSS attack once a corrupted template is used in
the Orchestration/Stack section of Horizon. A malicious Horizon user may
store an XSS attack by creating a network with a corrupted name. A
malicious Horizon administrator may store an XSS attack by creating a
user with a corrupted email address. Once executed in a legitimate
context these attacks may result in potential asset stealing (horizon
user/admin access credentials, VMs/Network configuration/management,
tenants' confidential information, etc.). All Horizon setups are affected.

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/105476>

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/105477>

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/105478>

Notes:
This fix will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in
future 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.2 releases.

# It's very difficult to discover how to mark a bug "Fixed"

### Bug Description

It's very difficult to discover how to mark a bug fixed when looking at the bug index page. It also takes a number of clicks to do so, even for those familiar with the process.

The current process, from the point where you arrive on the bug page, is as follows.

1. In the "fix requested for" column, click on the (non-underlined) name of the product or package where the bug has been fixed. (Usually this cell is orange.)

2. If the next page says "To change the information below, you must be logged in", do not click "Log In"! Instead click "change the information below", and log in on the next page.

3. From the "Status" menu, choose "Fixed". Then scroll down and click "Save Changes".

This process is in need of vast improvement. If not logged in, it requires four page loads; it should require only two. If logged in, it requires two page loads; it should require zero.

The bogosity of step 2 is covered by [bug 2883](/bugs/2883).

### Bug Description

The /admin/users/ page does not output encode users' email addresses correctly. Since there is no user input validation for the users' email address during creation process. It is possible to inject script tag into the email address. This is a stored cross site scripting issue.

The issue can be abused to hijack user's session and implant malware, etc.

For example, attached is a screen copy of Horizon for users with stored XSS in action.

Looks valid to me at first glance... Malicious user could specify crafted email address which then would XSS the admin... Waiting on horizon-coresec to confirm, though.

I can reproduce the problem and Horizon should be escaping the data. Havana and possibly previous versions are also affected.

With regard to the security impact, I think it depends on whether one is using an external system to manage users or has modified the default Keystone permissions. If I understand correctly, by default the Keystone policy doesn't allow users to modify their own email. User creation and update appear to require admin rights ("You are not authorized to perform the requested action, admin\_required. (HTTP 403)").

In itself, the problem is due to the use of the "urlize" filter to make the email address clickable. urlize expects the data to already be escaped. It looks like the filter is used in 2 places across the codebase, for users and groups management. I'll propose a fix.

commit de4466d88b816437fb29eff5ab23b9b964cd3985

Author: Julie Pichon <email address hidden>

Date: Thu May 22 16:45:03 2014 +0100

Fix multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

\* Ensure user emails are properly escaped

User emails in the Users and Groups panel are being passed through the

    urlize filter to transform them into clickable links. However, urlize

    expects input to be already escaped and safe. We should make sure to

    escape the strings first as email addresses are not validated and can

    contain any type of string.

Closes-Bug: #1320235

\* Ensure network names are properly escaped in the Launch Instance menu

Closes-Bug: #1322197

\* Escape the URLs generated for the Horizon tables

When generating the Horizon tables, there was an assumption that only

    the anchor text needed to be escaped. However some URLs are generated

    based on user-provided data and should be escaped as well.

\* Use 'reverse' to generate the Resource URLs in the stacks tables
