Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper output encoding of user email addresses on the `/admin/users/` page in the OpenStack Horizon dashboard. Specifically, the `urlize` filter is used to make email addresses clickable, but this filter expects its input to be pre-escaped. Since email addresses are not validated during user creation, it's possible to inject malicious scripts in the email address field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts injected into user email addresses are stored in the system and executed when an administrator views the user list page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker can potentially hijack an administrator's session by executing malicious JavaScript within the administrator's browser.
*   **Malware Implantation:** The attacker could potentially inject and execute malware via the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Confidential Information Exposure**: An attacker can potentially steal user/admin access credentials, VMs/Network configuration/management, tenants' confidential information, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious Horizon administrator creates a user with a crafted email address containing the XSS payload.
*   When another administrator views the user list page, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a Horizon administrator or have the privileges to create/edit users with the crafted email address containing the malicious script.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Xin of Rackspace.
*   Patches were created for the master, Icehouse, and Havana branches of Horizon.
*   The fix involves ensuring user emails are properly escaped before being passed to the `urlize` filter.
*   The fix addresses other XSS vulnerabilities related to network names and URLs generated in tables in addition to the user email vulnerability.
*   This issue was originally tracked as CVE-2014-3475, but was later split by MITRE, leading to the creation of CVE-2014-8578
