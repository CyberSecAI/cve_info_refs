### Aircrack-ng 1.2 Release candidate 1

Here is the [first release candidate](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/). I was wrong about saying there would be a fourth beta in [the post of the previous release](http://aircrack-ng.blogspot.com/2014/03/aircrack-ng-12-beta-3-release.html). There is exactly 7 month after the last beta. There will be most likely another one then the final release in the next few month.

Updating is highly recommend as this contains a lot of bug fixes and improvements as well as security fixes (CVE-2014-8321, CVE-2014-8322, CVE-2014-8323 and CVE-2014-8324). More details can be found in the blog.

Changelog:

* Airodump-ng should be able to parse the canonical oui file.
* Airodump-ng: Fixed GPS stack overflow.
* Airodump-ng: Fixed stopping cleanly with Ctrl-C.
* Airmon-zc: better handling for when modules are not available (incomplete)
* Airmon-zc: users can now start the monitor interface again to change channels
* Airmon-zc: update to use ip instead of ifconfig if available.
* Airmon-zc: better handling of devices without pci bus
* Aireplay-ng: Fixed tcp\_test stack overflow.
* OSdep: Fixed libnl detection. Also avoid detection on non Linux systems.
* OSdep: Fixed segmentation fault that happens with a malicious server.
* Besside-ng: Add regular expression matching for the SSID.
* Buddy-ng: Fixed segmentation fault.
* Makefile: Fixed 'commands commence before first target' error when building Aircrack-ng.
* Fixed segfault when changing the optimization when compiling with gcc thanks to Ramiro Polla.
* Removed airdriver-ng (outdated and not meant for today's kernels)
* Added gitignore file.
* Fixed build issues on other compilers by using stdint.h types.
* Updating installation file and added pkg-config as a requirement.
* Various small fixes and improvements.

   Seems more stable, but agree with the above comment. Loss of network when in mon-mode is a downgrade in functionality from previous version. Minor aesthetic issues with Airmon-ng info displayed too. Excellent work though and very much appreciated.
