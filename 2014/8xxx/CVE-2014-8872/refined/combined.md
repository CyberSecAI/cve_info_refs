The signature check of FRITZ!Box firmware images is flawed. Malicious

### Introduction

FRITZ!Box is the brand name of SOHO routers/CPEs manufactured by AVM
GmbH. The FRITZ!Box usually combines features such as an xDSL modem
functionality, routing, wifi access, VoIP, NAS and DECT.

### More Details

AVM regularly publishes firmware updates to address bugs and to
introduce new features. Those updates are cryptographically signed to
avoid tampering. The firmware image can either be uploaded manually or
the FRITZ!Box downloads it semi-automatically from
`http://download.avm.de` via unencrypted HTTP if a new version is
available.

Technically, AVM firmware images are tar files.

```
$ tar --list --file FRITZ.Box_7490.113.06.05.image
./var/
./var/regelex
./var/install
./var/info.txt
./var/tmp/
./var/tmp/filesystem.image
./var/tmp/kernel.image
./var/chksum
./var/signature

```

The firmware image contains a shell script called ./var/install, which
will be invoked after successful verification of the image. It is
responsible for flashing the new firmware.

In a tar archive, each file is described by a 512 byte header followed
by n\*512 bytes of file content. The end of a tar archive is represented
by 1024 null bytes after the last content block. In some cases, AVM
appends up to 8 KiB of excess null bytes. The whole tar archive,
including these additional null bytes, is covered by a cryptographic
signature that is stored in the file ./var/signature within the archive.

The file contains a 1024 bit RSA decrypted MD5 hash of the firmware
image. 1024 bytes of space (tar header+content) are normally allocated
to the signature file. When calculating the MD5 hash, that space is
treated as null bytes.

The library libfwsign.so is responsible for the detection of the
signature file in the tar header of the uploaded firmware image. It uses
the strstr() function of the C standard library like this:

```
if (strstr(filename, "/var/signature"))
{
// signature file found.
// update hash with 512 + n*512 null bytes.
} else {
// signature file not found.
// update hash with tar header and content of current file.
}

```

Therefore, any of the following names will be treated as a signature
file and null bytes instead of the real content will be fed to the MD5
hash function:

```
./var/signature
/var/signature
/tmp/var/signature/example
./var/signature/.././var/install

```

If such a file is placed after the last legitimate content block (where
at least 1024 signed null bytes reside), the library libfwsign.so will
compute the same MD5 hash as it would do for an unmodified firmware
image. As a result, the modified firmware image will pass the signature
verification.

The fourth file name, ./var/signature/.././var/install, contains a
directory traversal. When parsed by tar, a warning will be generated and
anything from the start of the file name up to /../ will be omitted. The
content of the file will be extracted to ./var/install and the original
./var/install file will be overwritten.

Thus, an attacker could easily inject malicious code into ./var/install,
which will be executed after the manipulated firmware image has passed
the signature verification.

### Proof of Concept

The following command manipulates the latest firmware image for the
FRITZ!Box 7490. When uploaded to a vulnerable FRITZ!Box 7490, all LEDs
of the device will flash constantly to indicate that code execution has
occured.

### Workaround

Check each firmware image manually for multiple occurrences of the
string “/var/signature” in file names using tar –list.

### Fix

Upgrade to a fixed firmware version. Before upgrading, check the new
firmware image for suspicious file names (see “Workaround”). AVM should
secure the distribution of firmware images with TLS to prevent MITM
attacks.

### Security Risk

This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into AVM
firmware images while maintaining its cryptographic signature. If the
attacker is able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack between the AVM
FRITZ!Box and `http://download.avm.de/`, firmware images can be
manipulated in transit. Otherwise, attackers need to trick their victims
into installing a malicious firmware image. While successful attacks
result in the full compromise of a device, they would typically require an
attacker in a very strong position. The vulnerability is therefore
considered to pose a medium risk.

Introduction
============

FRITZ!Box is the brand name of SOHO routers/CPEs manufactured by AVM
GmbH. The FRITZ!Box usually combines features such as an xDSL modem
functionality, routing, wifi access, VoIP, NAS and DECT.

More Details
============

AVM regularly publishes firmware updates to address bugs and to
introduce new features. Those updates are cryptographically signed to
avoid tampering. The firmware image can either be uploaded manually or
the FRITZ!Box downloads it semi-automatically from
<http://download.avm.de> via unencrypted HTTP if a new version is
available.

Technically, AVM firmware images are tar files.

  $ tar --list --file FRITZ.Box_7490.113.06.05.image
  ./var/
  ./var/regelex
  ./var/install
  ./var/info.txt
  ./var/tmp/
  ./var/tmp/filesystem.image
  ./var/tmp/kernel.image
  ./var/chksum
  ./var/signature

The firmware image contains a shell script called ./var/install, which
will be invoked after successful verification of the image. It is
responsible for flashing the new firmware.

In a tar archive, each file is described by a 512 byte header followed
by n*512 bytes of file content. The end of a tar archive is represented
by 1024 null bytes after the last content block. In some cases, AVM
appends up to 8 KiB of excess null bytes. The whole tar archive,
including these additional null bytes, is covered by a cryptographic
signature that is stored in the file ./var/signature within the archive.

The file contains a 1024 bit RSA decrypted MD5 hash of the firmware
image. 1024 bytes of space (tar header+content) are normally allocated
to the signature file. When calculating the MD5 hash, that space is
treated as null bytes.

The library libfwsign.so is responsible for the detection of the
signature file in the tar header of the uploaded firmware image. It uses
the strstr() function of the C standard library like this:

  if (strstr(filename, "/var/signature"))
  {
    // signature file found.
    // update hash with 512 + n*512 null bytes.
  } else {
    // signature file not found.
    // update hash with tar header and content of current file.
  }

Therefore, any of the following names will be treated as a signature
file and null bytes instead of the real content will be fed to the MD5
hash function:

  ./var/signature
  /var/signature
  /tmp/var/signature/example
  ./var/signature/.././var/install

If such a file is placed after the last legitimate content block (where
at least 1024 signed null bytes reside), the library libfwsign.so will
compute the same MD5 hash as it would do for an unmodified firmware
image. As a result, the modified firmware image will pass the signature
verification.

The fourth file name, ./var/signature/.././var/install, contains a
directory traversal. When parsed by tar, a warning will be generated and
anything from the start of the file name up to /../ will be omitted. The
content of the file will be extracted to ./var/install and the original
./var/install file will be overwritten.

Thus, an attacker could easily inject malicious code into ./var/install,
which will be executed after the manipulated firmware image has passed
the signature verification.

Proof of Concept

The following command manipulates the latest firmware image for the
FRITZ!Box 7490. When uploaded to a vulnerable FRITZ!Box 7490, all LEDs
of the device will flash constantly to indicate that code execution has
occured.

Workaround
==========

Check each firmware image manually for multiple occurrences of the
string "/var/signature" in file names using tar --list.

Fix
===

Upgrade to a fixed firmware version. Before upgrading, check the new
firmware image for suspicious file names (see "Workaround").  AVM should
secure the distribution of firmware images with TLS to prevent MITM
attacks.

Security Risk
=============

This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code into AVM
firmware images while maintaining its cryptographic signature. If the
attacker is able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack between the AVM
FRITZ!Box and <http://download.avm.de/>, firmware images can be
manipulated in transit. Otherwise, attackers need to trick their victims
into installing a malicious firmware image. While successful attacks
result in the full compromise of a device, they would typically require an
attacker in a very strong position. The vulnerability is therefore
considered to pose a medium risk.
