- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Asterisk handles access control lists (ACLs) when dealing with mixed IP address families (IPv4 and IPv6). The system only checks the incoming packet's address family against the first entry in the ACL. If the families do not match, the ACL rules are bypassed entirely.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of IP address families in ACL processing within various modules of Asterisk, allowing packets to bypass ACL rules if the address family does not match that of the first entry.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to unauthorized access and permit unwanted traffic to bypass configured ACLs, potentially allowing unauthorized users to connect to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, unauthenticated sessions where a user could craft an IP packet with an address family different from the first ACL entry.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected Asterisk system and the attacker needs to use a different IP address family than the first entry in the ACL rules.
