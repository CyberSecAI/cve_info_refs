- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ReportDownloadServlet` class contains a method that does not properly sanitize input, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the `ReportDownloadServlet` class.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to read arbitrary files under the context of SYSTEM on the affected server.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack, no authentication required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can be remote and requires no authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
