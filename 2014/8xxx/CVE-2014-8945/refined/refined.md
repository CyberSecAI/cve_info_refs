- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The username and password fields in the "add project" functionality of Lexiglot do not properly sanitize user input, allowing for command injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious POST request to `/vvv/lexiglot/admin.php?page=projects` with command injection payloads in the `svn_user` and `svn_password` fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to access the admin interface of the Lexiglot application and have the ability to add a new project.
