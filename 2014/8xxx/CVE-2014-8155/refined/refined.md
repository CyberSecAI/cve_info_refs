{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2014-8155": {
      "Root cause": "GnuTLS did not check the activation and expiration dates of CA certificates.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of certificate validity period"
      ],
      "Impact": "An application using GnuTLS could incorrectly accept a certificate as valid even if the issuing CA certificate has already expired.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could present a certificate signed by an expired CA, potentially leading to a bypass of security checks.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to present a certificate signed by an expired CA to an application using the vulnerable GnuTLS library."
    }
