    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-8564",
      "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds memory write flaw exists in the `_gnutls_ecc_ansi_x963_export()` function within gnutls_ecc.c. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of proper size validation when converting elliptic curve parameters into ASCII format, leading to a heap buffer overflow when writing data to the `out` buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds memory write",
		"Insufficient input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious user can craft a specially crafted ECC certificate or certificate signing request (CSR). When processed by an application compiled against GnuTLS (e.g., certtool), this can cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Processing of a specially crafted ECC certificate or certificate signing request (CSR)."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious ECC certificate or CSR to an application using the vulnerable GnuTLS library.",
	  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the  _gnutls_ecc_ansi_x963_export() function where the size of bigint x (and bigint y) is estimated using the _gnutls_mpi_get_nbits() macro. If the resulting 'byte_size' variable is bigger than numlen, then the size calculation  size = out->size - (1 + (numlen - byte_size)) results in a negative value.  This leads to an out-of-bounds write when _gnutls_mpi_print() uses the negative size to store the big int value into out->data."
