  "response": {
    "CVE-2014-4072": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework hashes specially crafted requests and inserts that data into a hash table, causing a hash collision. When many of these collisions are chained together, the performance of the hash table is greatly degraded.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of specially crafted requests leading to hash collisions."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could send a small number of specially crafted requests to a .NET server, causing performance to degrade significantly enough to cause a denial of service condition.",
      "attack_vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted requests to an affected .NET-enabled website, service, or program that uses Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable .NET application."
