Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-4115:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a buffer under-allocation issue in the Windows FASTFAT driver when it executes a specific function while interacting with FAT32 disk partitions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  A buffer under-allocation vulnerability exists in the FASTFAT driver when handling FAT32 partitions. This means that memory is not allocated correctly, leading to a situation where an attacker could write data to protected areas of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- An attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability locally by inserting a specially crafted USB drive into the system.
- Physical access to the system is required for successful exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs physical access to the target system.
- The attacker must be able to insert a specially crafted USB drive containing malicious code.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.
- The fix involves changing how memory is allocated during the specific function call within the FASTFAT driver.
- No workarounds have been identified.
- Microsoft was not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild when the security bulletin was issued.
