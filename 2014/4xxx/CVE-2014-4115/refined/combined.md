## Vulnerability in FAT32 Disk Partition Driver Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2998579)

Published: October 14, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way the Windows FASTFAT system driver interacts with FAT32 disk partitions. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by changing how memory is allocated when a specific function is called. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the Affected Software table later in this bulletin.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the FASTFAT driver executes a function that results in a buffer under-allocation issue. This buffer under-allocation could result in an attacker being able to write data to parts of the operating system that are normally reserved.

**What is FASTFAT?**

The Microsoft Windows FASTFAT driver is used to manage FAT32 disk partitions.

**What is FAT32?**

File systems are used to manage how data is written and read from a disk. FAT32 is a file system type that is supported by Microsoft Windows.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An unauthenticated attacker could attack a system locally by inserting a specially crafted USB drive into the system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and servers are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The security update addresses the vulnerability by changing how memory is allocated when a specific function is called.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.
