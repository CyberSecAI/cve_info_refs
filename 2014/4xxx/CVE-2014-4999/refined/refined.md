Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `kajam` Ruby gem, specifically in the `mysql.rb` file. The gem uses backticks to execute shell commands (`mysqldump` and `mysql`) with database credentials directly embedded within the command string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Password Exposure in Process Table:** The MySQL username and password (`@username` and `@password`) are included in the command string passed to `mysqldump` and `mysql`, making them visible in the process table.
2.  **Potential Command Injection:** The code does not sanitize the `@username`, `@password`, and `@database` variables before using them in the shell commands. If these variables are influenced by user-supplied input, an attacker could potentially inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Credential Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially view the MySQL username and password by inspecting the process table. This would allow them to gain unauthorized access to the database.
2.  **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  If the variables are user-controlled, an attacker could inject arbitrary shell commands, leading to unauthorized access, data modification or deletion, or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Process Table Snooping:** An attacker with local access to the server where the Ruby gem is running can inspect the process table to view the exposed credentials.
*   **Command Injection:** An attacker who can influence the values of  `@username`, `@password`, or `@database` through user-supplied input can inject arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Process Table Snooping:** Requires local access to the server.
*   **Command Injection:** Requires the ability to influence the values of `@username`, `@password`, or `@database`. This could be through a vulnerable web application using the gem, or some other method of controlling these inputs.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory confirms the vulnerability is present in `kajam-1.0.3.rc2`.
* The vulnerability report suggests the gem is used in the context of a rails application, which might be a way to control the variables.
