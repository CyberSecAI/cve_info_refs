Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-4078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper comparison of incoming web requests against the "IP and domain restrictions" filtering list in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS). Specifically, when a wildcard domain restriction rule is configured, the filtering mechanism fails to correctly handle certain crafted domain names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The core weakness is a bypass of the intended "IP and domain restrictions" security feature in IIS.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability is caused due to incorrect validation of domain names against configured rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Clients from domains that are intended to be blocked or restricted can gain access to protected web resources.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack occurs over the network through HTTP requests to a vulnerable IIS server.
- **Crafted DNS:** The attacker needs to have control over their reverse DNS information, or be able to poison the authoritative DNS of the IIS server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target IIS server.
- **Reverse DNS Control (or DNS poisoning):** The attacker must have the ability to control their reverse DNS information, or be able to manipulate the DNS to provide a crafted domain name that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of target server config:** Some knowledge about the target IIS server and network topology is needed for successful exploitation.
- **Specific IIS configuration**: The vulnerability is only present in servers with "IP Address and Domain Restrictions" enabled and with "Enable domain name restrictions" enabled.
