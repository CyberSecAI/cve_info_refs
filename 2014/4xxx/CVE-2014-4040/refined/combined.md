# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Security Advisory: Low

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0384)

## Topic

Updated powerpc-utils packages that fix one security issue, several bugs,
and add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The powerpc-utils packages provide various utilities for the PowerPC platform.

A flaw was found in the way the snap utility of powerpc-utils generated an
archive containing a configuration snapshot of a service. A local attacker could
obtain sensitive information from the generated archive such as plain text
passwords. (CVE-2014-4040)

The powerpc-utils packages have been upgraded to the upstream version 1.2.24,
which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
(BZ#1088539, BZ#1167865, BZ#1161552)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, the lsdevinfo command did not correctly process the path to the

device, which made the path unreadable in the console output of lsdevinfo. With
this update, lsdevinfo has been updated and the path is now displayed correctly.
(BZ#1079246)

* Previously, after migrating several Linux partitions, Resource Monitoring and

Control (RMC) was inactive and Machine Type, Model, and Serial number (MTMS)
were set incorrectly, so the subsequent validation operation failed. This bug
has been fixed, and validation is now successful after migration and suspend.
(BZ#1083221)

* Previously, when the drmgr tool attempted to remove the last CPU from the

system, drmgr became unresponsive or terminated unexpectedly. This bug has been
fixed, and drmgr no longer hangs or crashes in the described case. (BZ#1152313)

* With this update, the drmgr utility has been fixed to correctly gather Logical

Memory Block (LMB) information while performing Mem Dynamic Logical Partitioning
(DLPAR) on little-endian varian of IBM Power Systems CPU architecture as
expected (BZ#1170856).

* Previously, the "ppc64\_cpu --threads-per-core" command returned incorrect data

with the --smt option enabled. This bug has been fixed and "ppc64\_cpu

* -threads-per-core" now reports correctly with enabled --smt. (BZ#1179263)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancements:

* This update adds support for the Red Hat Enterprise Linux for POWER, little

endian CPU architecture to the powerpc-utils package. (BZ#1124006)

* This update adds support for hot plugging of the qemu virtio device with the

drmgr command to the powerpc-utils package.(BZ#1083791)

* The deprecated snap tool has been removed from the powerpc-utils packages. Its

functionality has been integrated into the sosreport tool. (BZ#1172087)

* With this update, a dependency on the perl-Data-Dumper package required by the

rtas\_dump utility has been added to powerpc-utils packages. (BZ#1175812)

Users of powerpc-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Are you reporting this as a prrn_hotplug vulnerability? If it were a
vulnerability, it would have a separate CVE ID. We didn't test the
code, but it looks more like an opportunity for a non-security
enhancement or maybe a bug fix. Our guess is:

  1. If the return value is nonzero, stdout is an empty string.

  2. All of the ">> $TMPFILE" will fail, and won't write anything into
     any file.

  3. The outcome is that /var/log/prrn_log doesn't have log
     information about what happened. We don't know of any direct
     security implications.

  4. Possibly the code should check the return value and print
     something like "mktemp failed - maybe you're out of /tmp disk
     space?" but it might be better to let the rest of the script run
     anyway (i.e., not abort after that error condition).

At least for now, there is no CVE ID for prrn_hotplug.

> I don't know if the data in /tmp/diagSEsnap is sensitive or not

  mkdir "/tmp/diagSEsnap", 0775;
  $general_eed_file = "/tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz";
  system("/usr/sbin/snap -o $general_eed_file 2>/dev/null 1>&2");

This seems to be similar to the CVE-2014-3925 sosreport issue.
snapH.tar.gz apparently will include /etc/fstab and therefore might
include a password.
<http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-54819>
says "When you report a problem to IBM Technical Support, run the snap
utility and send the ... file to them." In addition, snapH.tar.gz
apparently will include /var/log/messages, which traditionally is not
supposed to be a world-readable file.

(snap and sosreport aren't derivatives of the same code.)

Also, the question of whether "/usr/sbin/snap -o $general_eed_file" is
exploitable may depend on the behavior of snap. Apparently, snap does
check whether the -o output file exists but doesn't avoid TOCTOU
problems. Arguably, snap isn't responsible for avoiding TOCTOU
problems because it's not inherently designed for use with untrusted
output filenames.

So, three CVEs seems to be the right number here.

The ppc64-diag unsafe uses of temporary directories in these three
scenarios:

  "> /tmp/get_dt_files" [ in rtas_errd/diag_support.c ]

  mkdir "/tmp/diagSEsnap", 0775;
  $general_eed_file = "/tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz";
  system("/usr/sbin/snap -o $general_eed_file 2>/dev/null 1>&2");
  [ in scripts/ppc64_diag_mkrsrc ]

  TMP_DIR="/var/tmp/ras"
  mkdir -p $TMP_DIR
  MESSAGE_FILE="$TMP_DIR/messages"
  [ in lpd/test/lpd_ela_test.sh - see Novell bug 882667 ]

are primarily of interest because of symlink following, and are all
assigned CVE-2014-4038.

A second CVE for the ppc64-diag product is for the choice of weak
directory/file permissions for the snapH.tar.gz archive including data
that is not locally world-readable (e.g., /var/log/messages). This is
CVE-2014-4039.

A third CVE, CVE-2014-4040, is assigned for snap itself. snap can be
found at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerpc-utils> (i.e., it's not
part of the ppc64-diag product). This CVE is the one analogous to
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3925> (i.e., it
includes the "cleartext passwords ... lacks a warning" rationale).

CVE-2014-4039 and CVE-2014-4040 are vulnerabilities in different
products and can be addressed independently. For example, snapH.tar.gz
could have restrictive local permissions and still be sent to a remote
destination without review. Alternatively, snapH.tar.gz could continue
to have weak local permissions but snap could require the user to
acknowledge a warning about off-site distribution of an fstab
password, etc.
