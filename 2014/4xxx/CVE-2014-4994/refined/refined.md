Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4994:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two main issues within the `gyazo-1.0.0` Ruby gem:

1.  **Command Injection:** The gem uses string interpolation to construct shell commands using user-provided input (`imagefile`) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject shell meta-characters and execute arbitrary commands.
2.  **Predictable File Names:** The gem generates temporary file names using the current time (`Time.now.to_i` and `Time.now.usec`). This makes the filenames predictable, enabling an attacker to potentially clobber files created by the gem's process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `imagefile` variable when constructing shell commands opens the door for command injection. Specifically, an attacker could inject shell meta characters (e.g. ;,  `) or escaped quotes (") to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Predictable Temporary Files:** The generation of predictable file names for temporary files, using current time, makes it possible for an attacker to overwrite existing files if the attacker is able to predict the filename created by the program.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:** Successful command injection could lead to arbitrary command execution on the server. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.
*   **File Clobbering:** By predicting and creating files with the same name as the temporary files created by the gem, an attacker could overwrite files owned by the running process's user. This could lead to data loss or a denial-of-service if the clobbered files are important to the operation of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Command Injection:** Attackers can exploit the command injection vulnerability by providing malicious input via the `imagefile` parameter, which is then used unsanitized in a call to the `system` command.
*   **File Clobbering:** An attacker can exploit the predictable filenames by creating files with the same name before the gem’s process does.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to provide input to the application that utilizes the vulnerable `gyazo` gem, specifically influence the `imagefile` parameter, or have local access to the file system to create files with predictable names before the gem’s process does.
* The attacker also needs to know when the application or process will run that uses the `gyazo` gem in order to time their attack.
