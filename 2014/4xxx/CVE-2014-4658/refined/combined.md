## 1.2.2 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- July 4, 2013

* Added a configuration file option [paramiko\_connection] record\_host\_keys which allows the code that paramiko uses
  to update known\_hosts to be disabled. This is done because paramiko can be very slow at doing this if you have a
  large number of hosts and some folks may not want this behavior. This can be toggled independently of host key checking
  and does not affect the ssh transport plugin. Use of the ssh transport plugin is preferred if you have ControlPersist
  capability, and Ansible by default in 1.2.1 and later will autodetect.

## 1.2.1 "Hear About It Later" -- July 4, 2013

* Connection default is now "smart", which discovers if the system openssh can support ControlPersist, and uses
  it if so, if not falls back to paramiko.
* Host key checking is on by default. Disable it if you like by adding host\_key\_checking=False in the [default]
  section of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/ansible.cfg or by exporting ANSIBLE\_HOST\_KEY\_CHECKING=False
* Paramiko now records host keys it was in contact with host key checking is on. It is somewhat sluggish when doing this,
  so switch to the 'ssh' transport if this concerns you.

## 1.2 "Right Now" -- June 10, 2013

Core Features:

* capability to set 'all\_errors\_fatal: True' in a playbook to force any error to stop execution versus
  a whole group or serial block needing to fail
  usable, without breaking the ability to override in ansible
* ability to use variables from {{ }} syntax in mainline playbooks, new 'when' conditional, as detailed
  in documentation. Can disable old style replacements in ansible.cfg if so desired, but are still active
  by default.
* can set ansible\_ssh\_private\_key\_file as an inventory variable (similar to ansible\_ssh\_host, etc)
* 'when' statement can be affixed to task includes to auto-affix the conditional to each task therein
* cosmetic: "\*\*\*\*\*" banners in ansible-playbook output are now constant width
* --limit can now be given a filename (--limit @filename) to constrain a run to a host list on disk
* failed playbook runs will create a retry file in /var/tmp/ansible usable with --limit
* roles allow easy arrangement of reusable tasks/handlers/files/templates
* pre\_tasks and post\_tasks allow for separating tasks into blocks where handlers will fire around them automatically
* "meta: flush\_handler" task capability added for when you really need to force handlers to run
* new --start-at-task option to ansible playbook allows starting at a specific task name in a long playbook
* added a log file for ansible/ansible-playbook, set 'log\_path' in the configuration file or ANSIBLE\_LOG\_PATH in environment
* debug mode always outputs debug in playbooks, without needing to specify -v
* external inventory script added for Spacewalk / Red Hat Satellite servers
* It is now possible to feed JSON structures to --extra-vars. Pass in a JSON dictionary/hash to feed in complex data.
* group\_vars/ and host\_vars/ directories can now be kept alongside the playbook as well as inventory (or both!)
* more filters: ability to say {{ foo|success }} and {{ foo|failed }} and when: foo|success and when: foo|failed
* more filters: {{ path|basename }} and {{ path|dirname }}
* lookup plugins now use the basedir of the file they have included from, avoiding needs of ../../../ in places and
  increasing the ease at which things can be reorganized.

  be required in rare cases.

Other playbook changes:

* to\_yaml and from\_yaml are available as Jinja2 filters
* $group and $group\_names are now accessible in with\_items
* where 'stdout' is provided a new 'stdout\_lines' variable (type == list) is now generated and usable with with\_items
* when local\_action is used the transport is automatically overridden to the local type
* output on failed playbook commands is now nicely split for stderr/stdout and syntax errors
* if local\_action is not used and delegate\_to was 127.0.0.1 or localhost, use local connection regardless

* don not pass "--" to sudo to work on older EL5
* make remote\_md5 internal function work with non-bash shells
* allow user to be passed in via --extra-vars (regression)
* add --limit option, which can be used to further confine the pattern given in ansible-playbooks

Playbooks:

* YAML syntax errors detected and show where the problem is
* if you ctrl+c a playbook it will not traceback (usually)
* vars\_prompt now has encryption options (see examples/playbooks/prompts.yml)
* allow variables in parameterized task include parameters (regression)
* add ability to store the result of any command in a register (see examples/playbooks/register\_logic.yml)
* --list-hosts to show what hosts are included in each play of a playbook
* fix a variable ordering issue that could affect vars\_files with selective file source lists
* adds 'delegate\_to' for a task, which can be used to signal outage windows and load balancers on behalf of hosts
* adds 'serial' to playbook, allowing you to specify how many hosts can be processing a playbook at one time (default 0=all)
* adds 'local\_action: ' as an alias to 'delegate\_to: 127.0.0.1'

playbooks:

* support to tag tasks and includes and use --tags in playbook CLI
* playbooks can now include other playbooks (example/playbooks/nested\_playbooks.yml)
* vars\_files now usable with with\_items, provided file paths don't contain host specific facts
* error reporting if with\_items value is unbound

* to catch typos, like 'var' for 'vars', playbooks and tasks now yell on invalid parameters
* automatically load (directory\_of\_inventory\_file)/group\_vars/groupname and /host\_vars/hostname in vars\_files
* playbook is now colorized, set ANSIBLE\_NOCOLOR=1 if you do not like this, does not colorize if not a TTY

* ignore\_errors: yes on a task can be used to allow a task to fail and not stop the play
* with\_items with the apt/yum module will install/remove/update everything in a single command

inventory:

* groups variable available as a hash to return the hosts in each group name
* in YAML inventory, hosts can list their groups in inverted order now also (see tests/yaml\_hosts)
* YAML inventory is deprecated and will be removed in 0.7

* setup module no longer needs to run twice per playbook
* apt module now passes DEBIAN\_FRONTEND=noninteractive

* MySQL and PostgreSQL modules for user and db management
* vars\_prompt now supports private password entry (see examples/playbooks/prompts.yml)

* paramiko is now only imported if needed when running from source checkout
* cowsay support on Ubuntu
* various ssh connection fixes for old Ubuntu clients
* ./hacking/test-module now supports options like ansible takes and has a debugger mode

## 0.4 "Unchained" ------- May 23, 2012

Internals/Core

* internal inventory API now more object oriented, parsers decoupled
* async handling improvements
* misc fixes for running ansible on OS X (overlord only)
* sudo improvements, now works much more smoothly
* sudo to a particular user with -U/--sudo-user, or using 'sudo\_user: foo' in a playbook

* ansible INI style format can do groups of groups [groupname:children] and group vars [groupname:vars]
* groups and users module takes an optional system=yes|no on creation (default no)

Playbooks

* variables can be replaced like ${foo.nested\_hash\_key.nested\_subkey[array\_index]}
