Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-4549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `3DCallBack.php`, `3DComplete.php`, and `3DRedirect.php` files of the WooCommerce SagePay Direct Payment Gateway plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to the use of unsanitized parameters in the aforementioned PHP files. Specifically, the `MD` and `PARes` parameters are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable pages via crafted URLs, which would then be executed in the browsers of users who access the URL, potentially leading to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing sensitive information (including cookies)
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code within the `MD` and `PARes` parameters.
*   An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking a specially crafted URL. This could be done via social engineering or another mechanism for distributing malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and get users to visit them (e.g., via phishing or other methods).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions 0.1.6.6 and likely earlier versions of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.1.6.7.
*   The plugin is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin repository as it has been closed.
