## Vulnerabilities in Kernel-Mode Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3000061)

Published: October 14, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The more severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open a specially crafted document or to visit an untrusted website that contains embedded TrueType fonts. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to perform these actions. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to do so, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory and the way it handles TrueType fonts. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the Affected Software table later in this bulletin.

For additional guidance, see the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** section in this bulletin.

## Win32k.sys Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2014-4113

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-4113](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4113).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handles objects in memory.

**What is the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)?**

Win32k.sys is a kernel-mode device driver and is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem. It contains the window manager, which controls window displays; manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices; and passes user messages to applications. It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which is a library of functions for graphics output devices. Finally, it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).

**What is NULL page mapping?**

The âNULL pageâ is the area of system memory that starts with address 0x00000000. The NULL page is not typically allocated or mapped, so if the kernel dereferences a NULL pointer the usual result is a blue-screen condition. However, a blue-screen condition can be avoided if the NULL page is mapped, and because the NULL page resides in the user-mode memory address space, the attacker can allocate memory to take control of execution flow on behalf of the current user. This attack vector is not viable when NULL page mapping is disabled, which is the default state in Windows 8 and newer operating systems.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application on an affected system. This could be achieved through obtaining valid logon credentials and logging on to the system or convincing a logged on, authenticated, user to execute an application on the attackerâs behalf.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this. Although all supported releases of Microsoft Windows are affected by this vulnerability, 32-bit and 64-bit editions of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 are less exposed to currently known exploits due to mitigations built into these operating systems.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

## TrueType Font Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2014-4148

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel-mode driver improperly handles TrueType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-4148](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4148).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted website containing a specially crafted TrueType font file, or open the file as an email attachment. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to perform these actions. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to do so, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Deny access to T2EMBED.DLL**

  **On Windows Server 2003:**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
        Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
        Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N
        Echo y| cacls "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N

    ```

  **On Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2:**

  + For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
        Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"
        Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /deny everyone:(F)

    ```
  + For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:

    ```
        Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when a Windows kernel-mode driver fails to properly handles TrueType fonts.

**What is the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)?**

Win32k.sys is a kernel-mode device driver and is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem. It contains the window manager, which controls window displays; manages screen output; collects input from the keyboard, mouse, and other devices; and passes user messages to applications. It also contains the Graphics Device Interface (GDI), which is a library of functions for graphics output devices. Finally, it serves as a wrapper for DirectX support that is implemented in another driver (dxgkrnl.sys).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

There are multiple means by which an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, including convincing a user to open a specially crafted document or to visit an untrusted webpage that contains embedded TrueType fonts. The specially crafted TrueType font could then exploit the vulnerability.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel-mode driver handles TrueType fonts.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For information about these and other tools that are available, see [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
