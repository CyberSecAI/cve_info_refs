Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-4991:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the way the `codders-dataset` Ruby gem handles database credentials when interacting with MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. Specifically, it uses string interpolation to insert the database username and password directly into shell commands executed via backticks (`). This is present in both `mysql.rb` and `postgresql.rb`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Exposure of Credentials in Process Table:** The database username and password are included as command-line arguments, which means they are visible in the process table. This allows any user with access to process listings to see these credentials.
2.  **Command Injection:** The username and password values are not sanitized before being inserted into the command strings. A malicious user could inject shell metacharacters into the username or password to execute arbitrary commands on the server when the backtick command executes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can easily obtain database credentials by examining the process table. This could enable the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the database and perform various malicious activities, including data manipulation or exfiltration.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting shell commands into the username or password fields, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the user running the Ruby application. This can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the server can view the process table and obtain the database credentials or execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Remote Exploitation (Indirect):** If the Ruby application processes user input and uses that input to set the database username or password (directly or indirectly), a remote user can exploit the command injection vulnerability by providing malicious input. This is especially concerning when used within the context of a rails application that allows for unsanitized input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For credential theft via process table access, the attacker needs access to the server's process listings.
*   For command injection, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate the username or password used by the vulnerable Ruby code. This could be through direct or indirect control of these values.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in both `mysql.rb` and `postgresql.rb` of the `codders-dataset` gem.
*   The vulnerability is present in lines 18 and 24 of both files.
*   The provided information is more detailed than the official CVE description, offering source code examples and attack scenarios.
