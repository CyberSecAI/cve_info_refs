Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in a flaw within the Linux kernel's `ptrace` system call, specifically on x86_64 processors. The kernel doesn't properly validate the saved RIP (instruction pointer) address when a system call returns to user space using the `sysret` instruction (a fast return path). This allows a traced process's instruction pointer to be set to a non-canonical memory address by the tracer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient validation:** The kernel fails to enforce a check on the RIP register before using it in the `sysret` instruction. This allows a non-canonical address to be used, leading to a fault.
*   **`sysret` behavior on Intel CPUs**: On Intel CPUs, the `sysret` instruction itself faults if the RIP address is non-canonical. This is problematic in the context of `ptrace` because when returning to user space the full CPU state is not restored, and the tracer can change arbitrary register values, and these changes are not always reflected when returning with sysret
*   **`ptrace` and `fork`:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `ptrace` system call, particularly when combined with the use of `fork` to create a process to be traced. In certain code paths `ptrace_event()` stops happen in arbitrary places in the kernel and don't force IRET path

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (System Crash):** Exploitation can lead to a system crash due to the double fault generated by the invalid RIP address.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** By carefully manipulating the saved RIP, stack pointer and other registers, an attacker can potentially gain control over the execution flow after returning to user space, which could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
*   **Data corruption**: When `sysret` is used in the exploit, the registers are not fully restored, and the tracer might have modified the register set with data not meant to be used with the `sysret` instruction.
*   **Information leak**: Information leakage can occur on architectures where padding is not implicitly added to certain data structures due to differences in ABI

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a local, unprivileged user with the ability to call `ptrace` and `fork` system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a local user on the target system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to use system calls like `ptrace` and `fork`.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects systems using Intel CPUs because of the way `sysret` is implemented on those processors. Systems using AMD CPUs are not vulnerable because, on AMD, the fault happens after the CPL change.
*   The exploit bypasses the hardening mechanisms introduced in response to CVE-2005-1764 and CVE-2006-0744.

**Affected Systems:**

* Linux kernels prior to version 3.15.4, especially on Intel x86_64 processors.
*   Ubuntu systems are affected (including various versions like Lucid, Precise, Saucy, Trusty, Utopic, Vivid, Wily, Xenial), as well as their LTS and derivatives, when using a vulnerable kernel.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 are also vulnerable, although the text provides additional details.
*   Oracle Linux, Arch Linux and Debian distributions are vulnerable as well.

**Mitigation:**
* Update the kernel to a patched version. Patches address the issue by ensuring the kernel always forces a return to user space through the `iret` instruction instead of `sysret` after a ptrace stop.
