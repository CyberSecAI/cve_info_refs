  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2014-4124": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper permission validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. These vulnerabilities by themselves do not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, these vulnerabilities could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attack: An attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. Compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could also be used."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would have to convince users to take action, such as clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site. The vulnerability would have to be used in conjunction with a remote code execution vulnerability to run arbitrary code."
