- **Root cause of vulnerability:** QuickType, the predictive typing feature, could learn users' credentials when switching between different input elements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** QuickType was not properly handling input fields where autocomplete is disabled, and also had issues when switching between DOM input elements in legacy WebKit. This could lead to the leakage of sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability could lead to QuickType learning users' credentials, potentially exposing sensitive information like passwords or usernames.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is within the application by exploiting the use of QuickType when switching between input elements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have the user interact with input fields in a specific way to trigger QuickType to learn and potentially expose credentials. This could involve switching between different input elements where autocomplete is disabled.
