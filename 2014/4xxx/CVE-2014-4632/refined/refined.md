- **Root cause of vulnerability**: VMware vSphere Data Protection (VDP) does not fully validate SSL certificates coming from vCenter Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A Man-in-the-Middle attack could be performed, enabling the attacker to carry out unauthorized backup and restore operations.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between VDP and vCenter Server.
