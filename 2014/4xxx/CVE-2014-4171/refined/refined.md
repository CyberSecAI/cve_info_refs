{
  "CVE-2014-4171": {
    "Root cause": "A race condition in the Linux kernel's shared memory subsystem (shmem.c) when handling mmap, madvise(2), and fallocate(2) system calls.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition between mmap access and hole punching via madvise(2) or fallocate(2) calls."
    ],
    "Impact": "Local users can cause a denial of service by triggering the race condition, leading to an i_mutex hold and preventing other operations from completing.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access. An attacker requires the ability to execute code on the target system to trigger the race condition using mmap, madvise, or fallocate system calls.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local user access with the ability to execute code."
  }
}
