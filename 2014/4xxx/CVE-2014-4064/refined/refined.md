Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Windows kernel manages memory allocation. Specifically, when a kernel pool allocation is made against the paged kernel pool, it is not properly initialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uninitialized Memory:** The core weakness is the allocation of paged kernel pool memory without proper initialization. This leaves the allocated memory with potentially sensitive data from previous use.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability is classified as an information disclosure issue, meaning it allows an attacker to potentially read contents of uninitialized memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of memory addresses or other sensitive information residing within the uninitialized kernel pool.
- **Further Exploitation:**  The leaked information can be used to bypass security mechanisms, such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or other kernel protections, which can be used in subsequent attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access Required:** An attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the vulnerable system.
- **Memory Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the memory being allocated to the kernel in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to log in to the system.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker requires the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Knowledge of Memory Allocation:** The attacker must be able to manipulate the kernel's memory allocation mechanisms to trigger the vulnerability.
