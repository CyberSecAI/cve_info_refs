{
  "CVE-2014-4205": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the Portal Framework component of Siebel UI Framework, specifically related to how it handles input.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of input data leading to potential manipulation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to manipulate the application’s behavior or potentially execute malicious scripts within a user’s session, leading to integrity issues, possibly resulting in a partial compromise of the user's session",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "HTTP requests to the vulnerable component",
        "Manipulated input sent via HTTP requests"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Siebel application, and needs to be in a network position to do so. A medium level of complexity is required for successful exploitation."
