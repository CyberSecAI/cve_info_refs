Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4498:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that Thunderbolt devices could modify the host firmware if connected during an EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface) update. Specifically, the system was loading option ROMs from connected Thunderbolt devices during the EFI update process, which allowed malicious devices to inject code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of proper checks during EFI updates:** The system did not validate the integrity or source of option ROMs loaded from Thunderbolt devices during the firmware update process.
*   **Trust of Thunderbolt Option ROMs:** The system implicitly trusted the option ROMs provided by Thunderbolt devices, allowing them to execute code during the critical firmware update phase.
*   **Circumvention of cryptographic signature checks:** A malicious Thunderbolt Option ROM could be used to bypass the cryptographic signature checks that are supposed to protect the EFI firmware update process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution at boot:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to write untrusted code to the SPI flash ROM on the motherboard. This code executes from the very first instruction during the boot process, giving the attacker complete control over the system.
*   **Persistence:** The malicious code is written directly to the boot ROM, making it persistent across operating system re-installations and hard drive replacements.
*   **Stealth:** The attacker can use SMM (System Management Mode), virtualization, and other techniques to hide from detection.
*   **Viral propagation:** The bootkit can replicate itself to other Thunderbolt devices. This allows the bootkit to spread across air-gapped security perimeters via shared Thunderbolt devices.
*   **Control of EFI update process:** The attacker can replace Apple's public RSA key in the ROM, preventing legitimate firmware updates that are not signed by the attacker's private key.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical access:** An attacker needs physical access to the target machine to connect a malicious Thunderbolt device.
*   **Thunderbolt port:** The externally accessible Thunderbolt ports are used to connect the malicious device.
*   **Option ROM:** A malicious Thunderbolt device with an option ROM containing the exploit code is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical access to the target system.**
*   **Ability to create or obtain a malicious Thunderbolt device with a custom option ROM.**
*   **Technical knowledge of EFI firmware and Thunderbolt option ROMs.**

**Additional Details (From trmm.net):**
* The vulnerability is based on a two-year-old Thunderbolt Option ROM vulnerability.
* The attack was demonstrated as a bootkit that can be installed by an "evil maid" via the Thunderbolt port.
* The attacker's code can survive OS reinstallation and hard drive replacements.
*  The only way to restore the stock firmware is by using a hardware in-system-programming device.
