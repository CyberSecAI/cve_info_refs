Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and output encoding of user-supplied input in the "wp-guestmap" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin's `guest-locator.php`, `online-tracker.php`, `stats-map.php`, and `weather-map.php` files are all susceptible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize parameters like `zl`, `mt`, `activate`, and `dc` allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to:
   - Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session.
   - Steal cookies, potentially gaining access to a user's account.
   - Redirect users to malicious websites.
   - Modify the content of the affected web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vectors are the vulnerable parameters in the `guest-locator.php`, `online-tracker.php`, `stats-map.php`, and `weather-map.php` files. Attackers can inject malicious scripts via URL parameters such as `zl`, `mt`, `activate` and `dc`. The provided proof of concept payloads are within URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker does not need any special access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. Any user (including unauthenticated users) can craft malicious URLs and trigger the XSS vulnerability by getting a victim to load these URLs in their browser.
