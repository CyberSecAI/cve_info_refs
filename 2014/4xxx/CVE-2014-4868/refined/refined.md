Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-4868:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command, specifically within the restricted management console of the Brocade Vyatta 5400 vRouter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):**  Authenticated users can inject arbitrary OS commands by using backtick (`) characters within certain commands, allowing them to break out of the restricted management shell and access the underlying Linux shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain access to the underlying Linux shell.
*   The attacker can run arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges of their account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the management console of the Brocade Vyatta 5400 vRouter.
*   An authenticated user needs to exploit specific commands by including backtick characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the Vyatta 5400 vRouter management console.
*   The attacker needs to be aware of the specific commands that are vulnerable to backtick injection.
