## Brocade Vyatta 5400 vRouter contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#111588

Original Release Date: 2014-10-03 | Last Revised: 2014-10-03

---

### Overview

Brocade Vyatta 5400 vRouter versions 6.4R(x), 6.6R(x), and 6.7R1 contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| Brocade Vyatta 5400 vRouter versions 6.4R(x), 6.6R(x), and 6.7R1 contain the following vulnerabilities:  [**CWE-78**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')** - CVE-2014-4868The Vyatta 5400 vRouter provides a restricted management console for authenticated users to administer the device. By issuing back tick (`) characters with certain commands, an authenticated user can break out of the management shell and gain access to the underlying Linux shell. The user can then run arbitrary operating system commands with the privileges afforded by their account.[**CWE-284**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)**: Improper Access Control** - CVE-2014-4869The default permissions granted to users in the "operator" group allow them to access files containing sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords.[**CWE-20**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)**: Improper Input Validation** - CVE-2014-4870The default configuration also allows non-root users to run scripts in the /opt/vyatta/bin/sudo-users/ directory with elevated (sudo) permissions. Certain input parameters to the /opt/vyatta/bin/sudo-users/vyatta-clear-dhcp-lease.pl script are not properly validated. A malicious unprivileged user can run the script with elevated permissions and leverage its improper input validation condition to spawn an attacker-controlled shell with root privileges.The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-4870. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An authenticated, unprivileged user may be able to run arbitrary operating system commands, access files containing sensitive information, and escalate privileges to those of a root user. |
