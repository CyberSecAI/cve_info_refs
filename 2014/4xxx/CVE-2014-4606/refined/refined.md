*   An attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL containing the injected JavaScript code within the `zs_sid` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
