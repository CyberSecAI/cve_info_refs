**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application does not properly mask password values within the HTML code of the database connection and email settings pages. Even though the application appears to mask these values, they are still accessible by inspecting the HTML source.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** Sensitive information, specifically database connection and email passwords, are exposed within the HTML source code. The application fails to properly protect these credentials, leading to potential unauthorized access.
- **Insufficient Input Masking:** The vulnerability stems from the inadequate masking of password values in the HTML, allowing them to be easily revealed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain sensitive passwords (database connection and email credentials) by simply viewing the HTML source of the affected pages.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to the database and email server.
- An attacker may gain control over database and/or email systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Client-Side Attack:** The attacker needs to access the webpage where the password fields are rendered.
- **HTML Inspection:** The attacker can access the passwords by inspecting the HTML source of the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Epicor Enterprise application to view the HTML source code.
- No special technical skills are needed beyond inspecting the source code.
