## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2014-4763](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4763)

IBM Content Navigator is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

ACCE is vulnerable since it uses the framework from the affected version of ICN.

**CVSS Base Score: 3.5**

**CVSS Temporal Score: See** [**https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94660**](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94660) **for the current score**

**CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined**

**CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)**

\*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score. Customers can evaluate the impact of this vulnerability in their environments by accessing the links in the Reference section of this Flash.
