### [just works: thanks!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/just-works-thanks/)

very easy to install and to use.
I needed to keep track of the users (name and emails) that download my files without putting too much burden. enforcing a full registration to WP was too heavy, this simple form to give an email is perfect.
Please consider adding options for customizing the text tags displayed in both registration form and download link after (just like you already do for link title and description), eg to accommodate for specific usage conditions or different languages.
Thanks again.

This works easier and requires way less than “Email Before Download”. It works exactly how it I expected and has all the things I require.
The design is a bit clunky but you can fix that with CSS.
