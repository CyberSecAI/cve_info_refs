Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4998:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `lean-ruport` Ruby gem, specifically in the `test/tc_database.rb` file. The gem executes a `mysqldump` command using backticks which allows for shell command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command injection:** The code constructs a `mysqldump` command string using string interpolation with user-provided `user` and `password` variables without sanitizing these inputs. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by providing malicious input through these variables.
- **Exposure of database credentials:** The `mysqldump` command, including the database password, is executed and visible in the process table, making it readable by other local users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server if they control the `user` and `password` parameters in the context of a rails application.
- **Data breach:** Sensitive information such as database credentials are exposed in the process table, allowing unauthorized access to databases.
- **Compromise of the server:** With the ability to run arbitrary commands, an attacker can take control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **User-supplied input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious shell commands via user-supplied data that is used to construct the database connection string. If the application allows users to influence the `user` and `password` parameters of the mysql connection, it is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the `user` and `password` variables that are used within the vulnerable `mysqldump` command. This likely requires being able to somehow influence parameters passed to a Rails application that uses the `lean-ruport` gem.
