How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# About the security content of iOS 8.1

This document describes the security content of iOS 8.1

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see [How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620).

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see [Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222).

## iOS 8.1

* **Bluetooth**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: A malicious Bluetooth input device may bypass pairing

  Description: Unencrypted connections were permitted from Human Interface Device-class Bluetooth Low Energy accessories. If an iOS device had paired with such an accessory, an attacker could spoof the legitimate accessory to establish a connection. The issue was addressed by denying unencrypted HID connections.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4428 : Mike Ryan of iSEC Partners

* **House Arrest**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Files transferred to the device may be written with insufficient cryptographic protection

  Description: Files could be transferred to an app's Documents directory and encrypted with a key protected only by the hardware UID. This issue was addressed by encrypting the transferred files with a key protected by the hardware UID and the user's passcode.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4448 : Jonathan Zdziarski and Kevin DeLong

* **iCloud Data Access**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position may force iCloud data access clients to leak sensitive information

  Description: A TLS certificate validation vulnerability existed in iCloud data access clients. This issue was addressed by improved certificate validation.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4449 : Carl Mehner of USAA

* **Keyboards**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: QuickType could learn users' credentials

  Description: QuickType could learn users' credentials when switching between elements. This issue was addressed by QuickType not learning from fields where autocomplete is disabled and reapplying the criteria when switching between DOM input elements in legacy WebKit.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4450

* **Secure Transport**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL

  Description: There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL 3.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. An attacker could force the use of SSL 3.0, even when the server would support a better TLS version, by blocking TLS 1.0 and higher connection attempts. This issue was addressed by disabling CBC cipher suites when TLS connection attempts fail.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-3566 : Bodo Moeller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof Kotowicz of Google Security Team
