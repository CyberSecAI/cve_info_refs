- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A deadlock occurs when a SIP transaction timeout causes a subscription to be terminated. The thread servicing SIP requests becomes deadlocked due to the action taken by Asterisk.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a deadlock condition triggered by specific events in SIP subscription handling.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, where the Asterisk server becomes unresponsive due to the deadlock of the thread servicing SIP requests.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and requires an attacker to establish an authenticated session and successfully subscribe to a resource on the Asterisk server. The deadlock is triggered after a SIP transaction timeout on an established subscription
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to bypass authentication and successfully subscribe to a real resource on the Asterisk server.
