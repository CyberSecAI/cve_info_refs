CVE-2014-4667
```

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer underflow in the `sctp_association_free` function within the Linux kernel's SCTP implementation. This function incorrectly manages a backlog value (`sk_ack_backlog`) for certain SCTP packets, leading to a wrap-around effect when the value is decremented below zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Integer Underflow:** The core weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking on the `sk_ack_backlog` value before decrementing. This allows a negative value to wrap around to a large positive value.
- **Incorrect Backlog Management:** The `sctp_association_free` function does not distinguish between temporary and real associations when decrementing `sk_ack_backlog`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by sending crafted SCTP packets.
- **Socket Outage:** Specifically, the crafted packets cause the `sk_ack_backlog` to wrap around leading to the SCTP accept queue to appear full, preventing new associations from being established on a server socket. This can effectively block connections to the SCTP server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted SCTP packets received over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote and need not be authenticated. They need to have the ability to send SCTP packets to a vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in the `net/sctp/associola.c` file within the Linux kernel.
- The issue is present in Linux kernel versions before 3.15.2.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Gopal Reddy Kodudula of Nokia Siemens Networks.
- The vulnerability is rated as having a moderate severity.

The provided information also includes details of fixes and affected products in various Linux distributions like SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu and Red Hat, but those are not included in the vulnerability breakdown.
