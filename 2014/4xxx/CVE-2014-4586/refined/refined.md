Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4586:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `wp-football` WordPress plugin. Specifically, multiple parameters within different PHP files of the plugin are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. User-supplied input in the query string parameters are not sanitized and are directly outputted in the HTML, allowing malicious JavaScript to be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
    *   Steal cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Modify the content of the affected pages.
    *   Perform other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript within vulnerable parameters of the plugin's PHP files. When a user visits these crafted URLs, the unsanitized JavaScript code gets executed in their browser.
*   The vulnerable parameters include: `league`, `id`, `f`, `group`,`action`, `paged`, `id_group`, `id_league`, and `id_phase`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and entice victims to click or visit these URLs. This could be achieved through social engineering, malicious links, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities on the website.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated or logged in to exploit this vulnerability, the `Minimum Level of Access Required` is `Unauthenticated`.

**Specific Vulnerable files and parameters:**

*   `football_classification.php`:  `league` and `group` parameters.
*   `football_criteria.php`: `league` parameter.
*   `football-functions.php`: `ajax`, `id_group`, `id_league`, `f` and `id_phase` parameters.
*   `football_groups_list.php`: `action`, `paged`, `id` and `byajax` parameters.
*   `football_matches_list.php`: `action`, `paged` and `id` parameters.
*   `football_matches_load.php`: `action`, `paged`, `id_group`, `id_league`, and `id_phase` parameters.
*   `football_matches_phase.php`: `action`, `paged`, `id` and `id_phase` parameters.
*   `football_phases_list.php`: `action`, `paged` and `id` parameters.
*  `template_default_preview.php`: `league` parameter.
*  `template_worldCup_preview.php`: `league` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was identified by Anantshri.
*   The plugin was reported as closed.
*   No fix is available for the vulnerability.
*   The provided exploit examples uses `alert(document.cookie)` as a payload to demonstrate the XSS, but any javascript payload could be used instead
