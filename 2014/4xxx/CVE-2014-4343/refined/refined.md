{
  "CVE-2014-4343": {
    "description": "A double-free flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO initiators. An attacker able to spoof packets to appear as though they are from an GSSAPI acceptor could use this flaw to crash a client application that uses MIT Kerberos.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a double-free condition that occurs in the `init_ctx_reselect` function of the SPNEGO initiator when it receives a response from a GSSAPI acceptor with a different underlying mechanism than was initially proposed by the initiator.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double Free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the client application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network traffic that appears to come from an intended acceptor, but specifies a security mechanism different from the one proposed by the initiator."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to spoof packets to appear as though they are from a GSSAPI acceptor.",
      "Ability to inject packets into a legitimate GSSAPI session"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in MIT krb5 versions 1.10.x through 1.12.x before 1.12.2. The vulnerability is triggered during the SPNEGO negotiation phase when the acceptor sends back a mechanism that differs from the one requested by the initiator."
