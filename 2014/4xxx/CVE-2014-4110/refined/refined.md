Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4110:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that Internet Explorer does not correctly manage memory access, which can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** This memory corruption can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute code on the victim's machine.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-in user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the system.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based attacks:** Attackers can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:**  Attackers can inject malicious code into legitimate websites.
*   **User-provided content:**  Websites that accept user-generated content could also be used to deliver the exploit.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious site, often through links in emails or instant messages or by enticing users to open malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.
*   **Ability to host a webpage or compromise a web server:** The attacker needs to control a web server to host the malicious content or compromise a legitimate website.
*   **Social engineering skills:** The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious website or opening a malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Windows clients and **Moderate** for Windows servers due to the potential for remote code execution.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in the MS14-052 security bulletin.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6 through 11).
*   This CVE is one of many memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed by the same security update.
