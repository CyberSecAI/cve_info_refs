- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `loadExtensionFactory` method of the `TSVisualization` ActiveX control, which fails to validate the size of the input buffer before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution under the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can trigger the vulnerability by making the victim visit a malicious page or open a malicious file that utilizes the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to host a malicious webpage or distribute a malicious file to lure a user to interact with it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
