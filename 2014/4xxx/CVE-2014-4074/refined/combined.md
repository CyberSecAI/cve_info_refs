## Task Scheduler Vulnerability - CVE-2014-4074

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in how Windows Task Scheduler improperly conducts integrity checks on tasks. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the local system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user right.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-4074](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4074).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Turn off the Task Scheduler service**

  **Note** Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then select the following registry key:
     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Schedule
  3. Double-click the **Start** key, change its value from **2** to **4**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

  **Impact of workaround.** The user will be unable to run scheduled tasks on the computer. Be advised that this could have an adverse impact on processes that rely on Task Scheduler.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  1. Click Start, click **Run**, type **Regedit** in the **Open** box, and then click **OK**.
  2. Locate and then select the following registry key:
     HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Schedule
  3. Double-click the **Start** key, change its value from **4** to **2**, and then click **OK**.
  4. Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Windows Task Scheduler improperly conducts integrity checks on tasks.

**What is Windows Task Scheduler?**

Task Scheduler is a Windows service that enables the automation of routine tasks on a chosen computer. Task Scheduler does this by monitoring the criteria the user has chosen for initiating tasks (referred to as triggers) and then executing the tasks when the criteria has been met. For more information, see the MSDN Library entry, [Task Scheduler](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa383614%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the local system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over an affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Task Scheduler conducts integrity checks on tasks.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.
