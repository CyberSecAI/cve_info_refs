{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When initializing an internal data structure on ARM platforms, Xen did not correctly initialize the memory containing the list of a domain's grant table pages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information leak due to uninitialized memory being returned via the GNTTABOP_setup_table subhypercall.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious guest administrator can obtain memory contents of other domains, potentially including hypervisor data or other guests' memory.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious guest calling the GNTTABOP_setup_table subhypercall.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a malicious guest administrator within the Xen environment."
