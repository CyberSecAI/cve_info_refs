Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4458:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the "About This Mac" feature in OS X Yosemite v10.10. When this feature made a request to Apple servers to determine the system model and provide appropriate help resources, it included unnecessary cookies in the request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The weakness was the inclusion of cookies in the network request made by the "About This Mac" feature. This is a privacy issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact was that unnecessary information (cookies) was being sent to Apple servers. This could potentially expose user data or system information. The official description does not say it allows for arbitrary code execution or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector was the "About This Mac" feature itself. The vulnerability was triggered when the system attempted to determine its model information from the Apple servers, thus making a network connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
No specific attacker position or capabilities are described. This is a passive exposure that did not require active exploitation by an attacker, it would expose data in the normal operation of the described function.

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-4458 is a privacy vulnerability within the System Profiler "About This Mac" feature in OS X Yosemite v10.10. It was caused by including unnecessary cookies in network requests to Apple servers. The impact was unnecessary information disclosure. The vulnerability was addressed by removing cookies from the connection.
