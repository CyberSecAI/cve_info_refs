- **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds read issue existed in the handling of an IOAcceleratorFamily function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Out-of-bounds read
- **Impact:** A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application on the target system.
