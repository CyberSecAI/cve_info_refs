# Security Bulletin: Unauthorized Access to user data vulnerability in DB2 during certain LOAD operations (CVE-2014-4805)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

During certain LOAD operations into Columnar Data Engine (CDE) tables, a temporary file containing user data may be created at the DB2 server. As the file only exists for the duration of the LOAD operation and is automatically removed on completion (both success and error), the vulnerability exists only temporarily.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2014-4805](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4805)

**DESCRIPTION:**

While running LOAD into CDE table, depending on the input source of the LOAD command (more details on this below), DB2 will create a temporary file containing the user data being loaded. The temporary file only exists for the duration of LOAD command, and is automatically removed on completion (both success and error). Thus, the vulnerability exists only temporarily.

DB2 LOAD operation creates a temporary file if the input source of LOAD command into CDE table is one of the following:

- PIPE

- remote fetch (LOAD from CURSOR from a remote database)

- sourceuserexit (LOAD option to start external program to generate and feed data to LOAD)

- LOAD CLIENT

The temporary file is not created for the following sources:

- file

- LOAD from CURSOR, where CURSOR definition does not include DATABASE clause (i.e. local database)

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 2.1

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95307> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

All fix pack levels for IBM DB2 V10.5 editions running on AIX and Linux are affected.

IBM® DB2® Enterprise Server Edition

IBM® DB2® Advanced Enterprise Server Edition

The vulnerability is not applicable to DB2 releases before V10.5.

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the appropriate fix for this vulnerability.

**FIX:**

The fix for DB2 and DB2 Connect release V10.5 is in V10.5 FP4, available for download from Fix Central.

Download the fix pack from the following:

## Workarounds and Mitigations

The recommended workaround is: do not use the above mentioned input sources (i.e. PIPE, remote fetch, sourceuserexit , LOAD Client) for LOAD command into CDE tables.

Alternatively, customers who are performing LOAD into CDE tables via the input sources mentioned above, ensure that no users share instance owner's group. That is, the instance owner group should contain only one user ID, the instance owner ID.
