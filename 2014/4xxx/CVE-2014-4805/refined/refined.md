Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the creation of temporary files containing user data during specific LOAD operations into Columnar Data Engine (CDE) tables in IBM DB2. These temporary files are created when the input source of the LOAD command is one of the following: PIPE, remote fetch (LOAD from CURSOR from a remote database), sourceuserexit, or LOAD CLIENT.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Temporary File Handling:**  DB2 creates temporary files that store user data during the LOAD operation. Although these files are automatically deleted after the LOAD operation completes (either successfully or with errors), they exist temporarily, creating a window of opportunity for unauthorized access.
- **Lack of access control on temporary files**: The vulnerability is exploitable if the temporary file is accessible to unauthorized users during its existence.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to User Data:** An attacker who can access the temporary file during its existence can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive user data being loaded into the database.
- **Data Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a breach of data confidentiality, as user data is exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The vulnerability is rated as having a local attack vector (AV:L). An attacker needs to have local access to the server where the temporary files are created.
- **Timing:** The vulnerability is only present while the LOAD command is executing, therefore a time-sensitive exploitation is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access to the DB2 server:** The attacker needs to be able to access the filesystem of the DB2 server.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to be able to access the temporary file while the LOAD command is executing with one of the vulnerable input sources.
- **Ability to read files**: The attacker needs to be able to read the temporary files.
- **Shared Group Membership:** If the user performing the LOAD command shares a group with other users (especially with the instance owner), these users will potentially have read access to the temporary file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is only present when loading data into CDE tables and only when using specific input sources (PIPE, remote fetch, sourceuserexit, or LOAD CLIENT).
- The vulnerability is not applicable to DB2 releases before V10.5.
- The vulnerability is considered to be a temporary risk because the file is removed when the LOAD command completes.
- The provided workaround is to avoid the vulnerable input sources or ensure the instance owner's group contains only the instance owner user ID.
