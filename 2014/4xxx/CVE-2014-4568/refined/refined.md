Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-4568:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `message` parameter in the `r_logout.php` file of the "Video Posts Webcam Recorder" WordPress plugin. The plugin directly echoes the value of the `message` GET parameter back to the user without any sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `message` parameter of the `r_logout.php` URL. Because the application reflects this unsanitized input in the HTML output, the injected JavaScript will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    - **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content or appearance of the website.
    - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to pages that download malware.
    - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with the injected JavaScript payload in the `message` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:**  The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the vulnerable plugin is installed and accessible.
- **Social Engineering (Likely):**  Since this is a reflected XSS, the attacker would likely need to trick the victim into clicking the malicious link. This is typically done via social engineering, such as sending a phishing email or posting the link on a forum.

**Additional Information:**
- **Vulnerable Version:** The vulnerability exists in versions of the "Video Posts Webcam Recorder" plugin prior to 1.55.5.
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.55.5 of the plugin.
- **Sanitization:** The fix implemented in the plugin included sanitizing the `message` parameter before echoing it back to the user as shown in the provided diff of r_logout.php. The fix introduces `incsan.php` and calls `sanV($message)` before echoing the message.
