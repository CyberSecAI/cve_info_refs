# Security Bulletin: Tivoli Storage Manager UNIX and Linux client encryption key password vulnerability (CVE-2014-4818)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A vulnerability in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) UNIX and Linux clients would allow a local user to obtain the encryption key password.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:**[*CVE-2014-4818*](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4818)

IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Unix and Linux clients contain a vulnerability that would allow a local user to obtain the encryption key password used for backups and restores.

CVSS Base Score: 2.10

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95451> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

UNIX and Linux clients in the following TSM versions and releases:

* TSM 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.1.x
* TSM 6.4.0.0 through 6.4.2.x
* TSM 6.3 all versions
* TSM 6.2 all versions
* TSM 6.1 all versions
* TSM 5.5 all versions
* TSM 5.4 all versions

| 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, 5.5, and 5.4 |  | AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Macintosh, Solaris |  | Upgrade to fixing release or apply the workaround. |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

**Step 1**

Create a user group (e.g., tsmusers) that includes all users that need to use the TSM UNIX or Linux client.

**Step 2**

Restrict access to the stored encryption key password by restricting access to the client Trusted Communications Agent (TCA) by using the user group created in Step 1.

1. Use chgrp to change the ownership of dsmtca to include the tsmusers group.

   chgrp tsmusers dsmtca
2. Use chmod to set the execute bit for the group so that anyone in the tsmusers group can run dsmtca.

   chmod 750 dsmtca
3. Use chmod to set the SUID bit for dsmtca so that users in the group can run it with elevated privileges.

   chmod u+s dsmtca
4. Verify that the group has the execute bit set for the dsmtca file using:

   type ls -l dsmtca

   The output from this command shows that the SUID bit (s) is set for dsmtca in the user field and that the execute bit (x) is set in the group field.

   -rwsr-x--- 1 root tsmusers 13327961 2011-05-19 08:34 dsmtca

# IT06016: A NON-ROOT USER ON A TSM CLIENT MACHINE CAN RETRIEVE THE STORED ENCRYPTION KEY PASSWORD.

## A fix is available

[IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Client 6.4.3 Downloads and READMEs](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/584145)

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

##

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  By default, any non-root user on the TSM client machine can
  retrieve the stored encryption key password used to encrypt the
  node's data during backup and archive.  If a user also has
  access to the TSM server storage media, they could view
  encrypted files backed up by the client.

  ```

## Local fix

* ```
  It is important to separate the duties between client users and
  server administrators in case of mutual distrust.  Server
  administrators should not have user level access to the client
  systems.

  Restrict access to the stored password by removing or
  restricting access to the client Trusted Communications Agent
  (TCA) as described in the Tivoli Storage Manager Client User
  Guide section "Restricting Tivoli Storage Manager access to a
  user group".  This method has the administrator change the
  permissions on the Trusted Communications Agent (TCA) to
  restrict its access to a user group.  The administrator would
  then set up a group with a list of users that are allowed to use
  TSM and restrict access to the TCA module using that gorup.
  NOTE: After performing this procedure, users who are not
  included in the user group cannot use the client to perform
  backup or achive operations.

  ```

## Problem summary

* ```
  ****************************************************************
  * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *
  * Tivoli Storage Manager backup-archive clients running on all *
  * Linux/Unix platforms and using client side encryption.  The  *
  * following client versions are affected:                      *
  * - 7.1 clients below 7.1.2                                    *
  * - 6.4 clients below 6.4.3                                    *
  * - all clients 6.3 and below                                  *

  * For additional details, refer to the security bulletin       *
  * published here:                                              *
  * http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21697022       *
  ****************************************************************
  * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
  * Apply fixing level when available. This problem is currently *
  * projected to be fixed in Tivoli Storage Manager Client       *
  * levels 6.4.3 and 7.1.2.  Note that this is subject to change *
  * at the discretion of IBM.                                    *
  ****************************************************************
  *

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  The new default behavior for all non-authorized users will be to
  block access to the stored encryption key password. The client
  administrator will have to perform steps to enable encryption
  for trusted users. These steps will be documented:
  - for 7.1.2, in the new section "Enabling encryption for trusted
  users" of the client user guide
  - for 6.4.3, in the following technote -
  <http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27035885>
