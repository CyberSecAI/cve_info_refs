Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption. This improper handling allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is a memory corruption issue due to incorrect handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can be exploited to achieve remote code execution, which means an attacker could run code on the victim's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **User Rights:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the system.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attacks:**
   - An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
   - Compromised websites or sites that accept user-generated content could be used to host malicious content.
- **Social Engineering:**
   - The attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message.
   - Alternatively, attackers could entice users to open malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage. This can be done directly or through compromised websites.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince users to visit the malicious site.
- **Target User Interaction:** Exploitation requires the user to interact with the attacker-controlled content (by clicking a link or opening an attachment).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as critical for client versions of Windows and moderate for server versions.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The document mentions that systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.
- Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows servers provides a mitigating factor.
- The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET), if configured to work with Internet Explorer, can help mitigate these vulnerabilities.
