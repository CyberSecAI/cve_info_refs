  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-4615",
    "description": "The notifier middleware in OpenStack Neutron, Ceilometer, and the pyCADF library was found to expose authentication tokens in the message queue. An attacker with read access to the message queue could intercept these tokens from REST requests that pass through the notifier middleware. This occurs when the middleware is configured after the auth_token middleware pipeline.",
    "affected_components": [
      "OpenStack Neutron",
      "OpenStack Ceilometer",
      "pyCADF library"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The notifier middleware captures all environment variables, including the HTTP_X_AUTH_TOKEN, and sends them to the message queue without filtering.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Exposure of sensitive information (authentication tokens)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with read access to the message queue can obtain authentication tokens and potentially gain elevated privileges by impersonating valid users.",
    "attack_vector": "Network access to the message queue. The vulnerability is triggered when the notifier middleware is configured after the auth_token middleware in the pipeline.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "Read access to the message queue.",
      "affected_versions": {
        "Neutron": [
          "2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1",
            "Icehouse",

          ]
      },
    "additional_notes": "The notifier middleware is not enabled by default in any service. The vulnerability occurs only if the notifier middleware is used after the auth_token middleware. The issue was present in the oslo-incubator, and copied to Neutron and Ceilometer. pyCADF adopted the notifier middleware."
