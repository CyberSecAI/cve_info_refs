I think this one will need an OSSA. I suspect that meter is traditionally read by people other than tenant admins ?

It seems that this was introduced in Icehouse, thus we are still missing those patches:

\* Ceilometer master and stable/icehouse

\* Neutron stable/icehouse

Gordon, could you please propose Ceilometer fixes as well ?

@Gordon, so I have a couple question for the impact description draft.

From the bug description, it appears that the leaked "request.HTTP\_X\_AUTH\_TOKEN: 4724" is not the same than the one provided in the curl command "-H 'X-Auth-Token: 258ab"

So is the leak the token of the user requesting the notifier, or is it the admin\_token defined in [filter:authtoken] configuration ?

The conditions for this leak to happen is when the notifier middleware is set after authtoken, which is not by default right ?

so the leaked HTTP\_X\_AUTH\_TOKEN value is the one in provided in curl command (i assume the description is using curl command and request object that aren't related)... it is not the admin\_token defined in [filter:authtoken] configuration

you are correct that the leak happens only if notifier middleware is used after auth\_token middleware (which it usually is)... by default the notifier middleware is not enabled in any service.

@Zhi Kun Liu, Havana is impacted as well ?

@All, While oslo-incubator is not supported, should we include it in this OSSA ? Is it realistic to use this middleware out of Oslo in another service or only Neutron and Ceilometer are actually impacted ?

In the meantime, here is the impact description draft #1:

Title: User token leak to message queue in the notifier middleware

Reporter: Zhi Kun Liu (IBM)

Products: Neutron, Ceilometer, Oslo

Versions: 2014.1.1

Description:

Zhi Kun Liu from IBM reported a vulnerability in the notifier middleware available in Neutron and Ceilometer or through the Oslo library. An attacker with read access to the message queue may obtain authentication tokens used in REST requests (X\_AUTH\_TOKEN) that goes through the notifier middleware. All services using the notifier middleware configured after the auth\_token middleware pipeline are impacted.

There are 2 copies of the notifier middleware in different places in Oslo.

The copy in the incubator is used by projects that have not yet updated to oslo.messaging, such as neutron.

There is also a copy in the PyCADF library, used by projects that have updated to oslo.messaging, such as ceilometer.

Based on the history here, it looks like both copies have been fixed, so I think changing the impact description to say "the PyCADF library" instead of "the Oslo Library" will make it clear which library needs to be updated.

There are 2 copies of the notifier middleware in different places in Oslo.

@Doug, Thanks for clarifying!

Though from <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security_supported_projects>, oslo-incubator, oslo.messaging and PyCADF are not security supported projects (at least not in OSSA territory).

However if the notifier middleware is known to be used in services other than Neutron and Ceilometer, I'm wondering how to cover that.

The incubator isn't on the OSSA list because the code in the incubator is copied into other projects that are on the list, and it's assumed that changes go into the incubator before being released into the project(s) using the modules.

oslo.messaging and PyCADF are new releases from the oslo program, and are being added to the list (probably during Juno, but that's not set for certain).

I'm not certain what uses the notifier middleware. Technically, it's middleware, so it don't have to be included in a project for a deployer to use it.

@Gordon, do you have any insight into other projects using the middleware?

the original blueprint for notifier middleware is: [https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/+spec/count-api-requests](https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ceilometer/%2Bspec/count-api-requests). i'm unaware of anyone using the notifier middleware on its alone. to my knowledge, the main consumer of notifier middlware is pyCADF (and its audit middlware).

regarding the audit middleware:

the audit middleware (from oslo-incubator) was synced into Neutron in icehouse as a side effect of another patch (so it may not even be used). the audit middleware was also synced into Ceilometer in havana i believe (to my knowledge it's not used either as pycadf is not a requirement in Ceilometer)

the audit middleware (from pycadf) was purposely set as a requirement in Nova in icehouse and is used (it is optionally enabled by deployer). this audit middleware (from pycadf) did not exist before icehouse.

i'm not aware of any other projects pulling in pyCADF (and it's audit middleware).

hope this brain dump helps :)

remove token from notifier middleware

notifier middleware is capturing token and sending it to MQ. this

@Tristan Cacqueray, I checked nova and neutorn codes in Havana, they don't have audit and notifier middleware. So this does not impact Havana. It's only an internal problem of us. Thanks for your reminding!

OK, this is confusing. Let me try to get an accurate picture of affected versions:

oslo-incubator contains affected code in master (patched), stable/icehouse (in review) and stable/havana

That code was copied in:

Neutron: Juno (patched), Icehouse

Ceilometer: Icehouse (in review), Havana

Then it was adopted in:

pyCADF all versions <= 0.5 (0.5.1 contains the fix)

My understanding is that oslo.messaging is not affected.

Adjusted tasks to match.

Here is how I would rewrite the advisory:

------

Title: User token leak to message queue in pyCADF notifier middleware

Reporter: Zhi Kun Liu (IBM)

Products: Neutron (2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1)

          Ceilometer (2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.3, 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1)

          pyCADF library (all versions up to 0.5.0)

Description:

Zhi Kun Liu from IBM reported a vulnerability in the notifier middleware available in the PyCADF library and formerly copied into Neutron and Ceilometer code. An attacker with read access to the message queue may obtain authentication tokens used in REST requests (X\_AUTH\_TOKEN) that goes through the notifier middleware. All services using the notifier middleware configured after the auth\_token middleware pipeline are impacted.

------

NB: that would mean from now on we support PyCADF, but I think now would be a good time to start.

why is the CVE for this still not public? It still just says it has been reserved... "This candidate has been reserved by an organization or individual that will use it when announcing a new security problem. When the candidate has been publicized, the details for this candidate will be provided."

I'm guessing this was just an oversight. Can someone fix it?

It takes months, sometimes years for MITRE to come back to a reserved CVE and fill the appropriate information on their website. In the mean time, the CVE number serves as a reference number for all the people that need to coordinate on an issue.

It was publicly assigned by MITRE in <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/24/6> and sometimes it takes their editorial board a while to compose and publish the official CVE description (can be on the order of several months).

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Neutron, Ceilometer and
 pyCADF library

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: User token leak to message queue in pyCADF notifier middleware
Reporter: Zhi Kun Liu (IBM)
Products: Neutron    (2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1)
          Ceilometer (2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.3,
                      2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1)
          pyCADF library (all versions up to 0.5.0)

Description:
Zhi Kun Liu from IBM reported a vulnerability in the notifier middleware
available in the PyCADF library and formerly copied into Neutron and
Ceilometer code. An attacker with read access to the message queue may
obtain authentication tokens used in REST requests (X_AUTH_TOKEN) that
goes through the notifier middleware. All services using the notifier
middleware configured after the auth_token middleware pipeline are impacted.

Subject: [OSSA 2014-021] User token leak to message queue in pyCADF notifier
 middleware (CVE-2014-4615)

OpenStack Security Advisory: 2014-021
CVE: CVE-2014-4615
Date: June 25, 2014
Title: User token leak to message queue in pyCADF notifier middleware
Reporter: Zhi Kun Liu (IBM)
Products: Neutron    (2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1)
          Ceilometer (2013.2 versions up to 2013.2.3,
                      2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.1)
          pyCADF library (all versions up to 0.5.0)

Description:
Zhi Kun Liu from IBM reported a vulnerability in the notifier middleware
available in the PyCADF library and formerly copied into Neutron and
Ceilometer code. An attacker with read access to the message queue may
obtain authentication tokens used in REST requests (X_AUTH_TOKEN) that
goes through the notifier middleware. All services using the notifier
middleware configured after the auth_token middleware pipeline are impacted.

pyCADF fix (included in 0.5.1 release):
<https://review.openstack.org/94878>      (pyCADF)

Juno (development branch) fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/94891>      (Neutron)

Icehouse fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/101097>     (Neutron)
<https://review.openstack.org/96944>      (Ceilometer)

Havana fix:
<https://review.openstack.org/101799>     (Ceilometer)

Notes:
Ceilometer Juno (master) branch is not affected.
Those fixes will be included in the Juno-2 development milestone and in
future 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.2 releases.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1050)

## Topic

Updated OpenStack Telemetry packages that fix one security issue and one
bug are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Telemetry (ceilometer) collects customer usage data for metering
purposes. Telemetry implements bus listener, push, and polling agents for
data collection; this data is stored in a database and presented via the
REST API. In addition, Telemetry's extensible design means it can be
optionally extended to gather customized data sets.

It was found that authentication tokens were not properly sanitized from
the message queue by the notifier middleware. An attacker with read access
to the message queue could possibly use this flaw to intercept an
authentication token and gain elevated privileges. Note that all services
using the notifier middleware configured after the auth\_token middleware
pipeline were affected. (CVE-2014-4615)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* An incompatibility issue was found with the recent update of the

python-qpid package. This caused several OpenStack services, including
OpenStack Telemetry, to malfunction. By updating the RPC code, this issue
is now resolved. (BZ#1116462)

All OpenStack Telemetry users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.
