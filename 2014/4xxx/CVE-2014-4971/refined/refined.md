{
  "CVE-2014-4971": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of the user-provided OutputBuffer address in the IRP handler routine of the MQAC and BthPan drivers.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Write-what-where condition due to missing validation of the output buffer address.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege escalation by overwriting HalDispatchTable+0x4, allowing arbitrary code execution in kernel mode.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local, through crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable drivers (MQAC.sys, BthPan.sys).",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to open a handle to the vulnerable device and send DeviceIoControlFile requests."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) service improperly handles objects in memory by inadvertently allowing overwrite.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Message Queuing service improperly handles objects in memory, inadvertently allowing overwrite via a crafted IOCTL request. This is a memory corruption issue leading to arbitrary write.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to take complete control of the affected system. They could then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local, by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request to the Message Queuing service.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally."
