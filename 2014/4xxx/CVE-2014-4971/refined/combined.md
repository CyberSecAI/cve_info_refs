Title: Microsoft XP SP3 MQAC.sys Arbitrary Write Privilege Escalation
Advisory ID: KL-001-2014-003
Publication Date: 2014.07.18
Publication URL: <https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2014-003.txt>

1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Microsoft
     Affected Product: MQ Access Control
     Affected Versions: 5.1.0.1110
     Platform: Microsoft Windows XP SP3
     CWE Classification: CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition
     Impact: Privilege Escalation
     Attack vector: IOCTL
     CVE ID: CVE-2014-4971

2. Vulnerability Description

     A vulnerability within the MQAC module allows an attacker to
     inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they
     define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently
     calling NtQueryIntervalProfile.

3. Technical Description

     A userland process can create a handle into the MQAC device and
     subsequently make DeviceIoControlFile() calls into that device.
     During the IRP handler routine for 0x1965020f the user provided
     OutputBuffer address is not validated. This allows an attacker
     to specify an arbitrary address and write (or overwrite) the
     memory residing at the specified address. This is classically
     known as a write-what-where vulnerability and has well known
     exploitation methods associated with it.

     A stack trace from our fuzzing can be seen below. In our
     fuzzing testcase, the specified OutputBuffer in the
     DeviceIoControlFile() call is 0xffff0000.

STACK_TEXT:
b1c4594c 8051cc7f 00000050 ffff0000 00000001 nt!KeBugCheckEx+0x1b
b1c459ac 805405d4 00000001 ffff0000 00000000 nt!MmAccessFault+0x8e7

b1c45b80 8056e57c 000006a4 00000000 00000000 nt!IopXxxControlFile+0x5e7
b1c45bb4 b1aea17e 000006a4 00000000 00000000 nt!NtDeviceIoControlFile+0x2a

     Reviewing the FOLLOWUP_IP value from the WinDBG '!analyze -v'
     command shows the fault originating in the mqac driver.

OLLOWUP_IP:
mqac!AC2QM+5d
b230af37 891e            mov     dword ptr [esi],ebx

     Reviewing the TRAP_FRAME at the time of crash we can see
     IopCompleteRequest() copying data from InputBuffer into the
     OutputBuffer. InputBuffer is another parameter provided to the
     DeviceIoControlFile() function and is therefore controllable by
     the attacker. The edi register contains the invalid address
     provided during the fuzz testcase.

TRAP_FRAME:  b1c459c4 -- (.trap 0xffffffffb1c459c4)
ErrCode = 00000002
eax=b1c45a58 ebx=00000000 ecx=ffff0000 edx=82377e48 esi=ffff0000 edi=00000000
eip=b230af37 esp=b1c45a38 ebp=b1c45a68 iopl=0         nv up ei pl zr na pe nc
cs=0008  ss=0010  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=0030  gs=0000             efl=00010246
mqac!AC2QM+0x5d:
b230af37 891e            mov     dword ptr [esi],ebx  ds:0023:ffff0000=????????

     A write-what-where vulnerability can be leveraged to obtain
     escalated privileges. To do so, an attacker will need to
     allocate memory in userland that is populated with shellcode
     designed to find the Token for PID 4 (System) and then overwrite
     the token for its own process. By leveraging the vulnerability
     in MQAC it is then possible to overwrite the pointer at
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 with a pointer to our shellcode. Calling
     NtQueryIntervalProfile() will subsequently call
     HalDispatchTable+0x4, execute our shellcode, and elevate the
     privilege of the exploit process.

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     None. A patch is not likely to be forthcoming from the vendor.

5. Credit

     This vulnerability was discovered by Matt Bergin of KoreLogic

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

KL-001-2014-003 : Microsoft XP SP3 MQAC.sys Arbitrary Write Privilege Escalation
Title: Microsoft XP SP3 MQAC.sys Arbitrary Write Privilege Escalation
Advisory ID: KL-001-2014-003
Publication Date: 2014.07.18
Publication URL: https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2014-003.txt
1. Vulnerability Details
Affected Vendor: Microsoft
Affected Product: MQ Access Control
Affected Versions: 5.1.0.1110
Platform: Microsoft Windows XP SP3
CWE Classification: CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition
Impact: Privilege Escalation
Attack vector: IOCTL
CVE ID: CVE-2014-4971
2. Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability within the MQAC module allows an attacker to
inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they
define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite
HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently
calling NtQueryIntervalProfile.
3. Technical Description
A userland process can create a handle into the MQAC device and
subsequently make DeviceIoControlFile() calls into that device.
During the IRP handler routine for 0x1965020f the user provided
OutputBuffer address is not validated. This allows an attacker
to specify an arbitrary address and write (or overwrite) the
memory residing at the specified address. This is classically
known as a write-what-where vulnerability and has well known
exploitation methods associated with it.
A stack trace from our fuzzing can be seen below. In our
fuzzing testcase, the specified OutputBuffer in the
DeviceIoControlFile() call is 0xffff0000.
STACK\_TEXT:

Reviewing the FOLLOWUP\_IP value from the WinDBG '!analyze -v'
command shows the fault originating in the mqac driver.
OLLOWUP\_IP:
mqac!AC2QM+5d
b230af37 891e mov dword ptr [esi],ebx
Reviewing the TRAP\_FRAME at the time of crash we can see
IopCompleteRequest() copying data from InputBuffer into the
OutputBuffer. InputBuffer is another parameter provided to the
DeviceIoControlFile() function and is therefore controllable by
the attacker. The edi register contains the invalid address
provided during the fuzz testcase.
TRAP\_FRAME: b1c459c4 -- (.trap 0xffffffffb1c459c4)
ErrCode = 00000002
eax=b1c45a58 ebx=00000000 ecx=ffff0000 edx=82377e48 esi=ffff0000 edi=00000000

mqac!AC2QM+0x5d:
b230af37 891e mov dword ptr [esi],ebx ds:0023:ffff0000=????????
A write-what-where vulnerability can be leveraged to obtain
escalated privileges. To do so, an attacker will need to
allocate memory in userland that is populated with shellcode
designed to find the Token for PID 4 (System) and then overwrite
the token for its own process. By leveraging the vulnerability
in MQAC it is then possible to overwrite the pointer at
HalDispatchTable+0x4 with a pointer to our shellcode. Calling
NtQueryIntervalProfile() will subsequently call
HalDispatchTable+0x4, execute our shellcode, and elevate the
privilege of the exploit process.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
None. A patch is not likely to be forthcoming from the vendor.
5. Credit
This vulnerability was discovered by Matt Bergin of KoreLogic
Security, Inc.

Affected Versions: 5.1.2600.5512
Platform: Microsoft Windows XP SP3
CWE Classification: CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition
Impact: Privilege Escalation
Attack vector: IOCTL
CVE ID: CVE-2014-4971
2. Vulnerability Description
A vulnerability within the BthPan module allows an attacker to
inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they
define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite
HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently
calling NtQueryIntervalProfile.
3. Technical Description
A userland process can create a handle into the BthPan device
and subsequently make DeviceIoControlFile() calls into that
device. During the IRP handler routine for 0x0012b814 the user
provided OutputBuffer address is not validated. This allows an
attacker to specify an arbitrary address and write
(or overwrite) the memory residing at the specified address.
This is classicaly known as a write-what-where vulnerability and
has well known exploitation methods associated with it.
A stack trace from our fuzzing can be seen below. In our fuzzing
testcase, the specified OutputBuffer in the DeviceIoControlFile()
call is 0xffff0000.

A write-what-where vulnerability can be leveraged to obtain
escalated privileges. To do so, an attacker will need to
allocate memory in userland that is populated with shellcode
designed to find the Token for PID 4 (System) and then overwrite
the token for its own process. By leveraging the vulnerability
in BthPan it is then possible to overwrite the pointer at
HalDispatchTable+0x4 with a pointer to our shellcode. Calling
NtQueryIntervalProfile() will subsequently call
HalDispatchTable+0x4, execute our shellcode, and elevate the
privilege of the exploit process.
4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation
None. A patch is not likely to be forthcoming from the vendor.

1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Microsoft
     Affected Product: Bluetooth Personal Area Networking
     Affected Versions: 5.1.2600.5512
     Platform: Microsoft Windows XP SP3
     CWE Classification: CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition
     Impact: Privilege Escalation
     Attack vector: IOCTL
     CVE ID: CVE-2014-4971

2. Vulnerability Description

     A vulnerability within the BthPan module allows an attacker to
     inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they
     define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently
     calling NtQueryIntervalProfile.

3. Technical Description

     A userland process can create a handle into the BthPan device
     and subsequently make DeviceIoControlFile() calls into that
     device. During the IRP handler routine for 0x0012b814 the user
     provided OutputBuffer address is not validated. This allows an
     attacker to specify an arbitrary address and write
     (or overwrite) the memory residing at the specified address.
     This is classicaly known as a write-what-where vulnerability and
     has well known exploitation methods associated with it.

     A write-what-where vulnerability can be leveraged to obtain
     escalated privileges. To do so, an attacker will need to
     allocate memory in userland that is populated with shellcode
     designed to find the Token for PID 4 (System) and then overwrite
     the token for its own process. By leveraging the vulnerability
     in BthPan it is then possible to overwrite the pointer at
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 with a pointer to our shellcode. Calling
     NtQueryIntervalProfile() will subsequently call
     HalDispatchTable+0x4, execute our shellcode, and elevate the
     privilege of the exploit process.

Title: Microsoft XP SP3 BthPan.sys Arbitrary Write Privilege Escalation
Advisory ID: KL-001-2014-002
Publication Date: 2014-07-18
Publication URL: https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2014-002.txt

1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Microsoft
     Affected Product: Bluetooth Personal Area Networking
     Affected Versions: 5.1.2600.5512
     Platform: Microsoft Windows XP SP3
     CWE Classification: CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition
     Impact: Privilege Escalation
     Attack vector: IOCTL
     CVE ID: CVE-2014-4971

2. Vulnerability Description

     A vulnerability within the BthPan module allows an attacker to
     inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they
     define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently
     calling NtQueryIntervalProfile.

3. Technical Description

     A userland process can create a handle into the BthPan device
     and subsequently make DeviceIoControlFile() calls into that
     device. During the IRP handler routine for 0x0012b814 the user
     provided OutputBuffer address is not validated. This allows an
     attacker to specify an arbitrary address and write
     (or overwrite) the memory residing at the specified address.
     This is classicaly known as a write-what-where vulnerability and
     has well known exploitation methods associated with it.

     A stack trace from our fuzzing can be seen below. In our fuzzing
     testcase, the specified OutputBuffer in the DeviceIoControlFile()
     call is 0xffff0000.

WARNING: Stack unwind information not available. Following frames may be wrong.

     Reviewing the FOLLOWUP_IP value from the WinDBG '!analyze -v'
     command shows the fault originating in the bthpan driver.

b272b5a1 ebc2            jmp     bthpan!BthpanReqAdd+0x12f (b272b565)

     Reviewing the TRAP_FRAME at the time of crash we can see
     IopCompleteRequest() copying data from InputBuffer into the
     OutputBuffer. InputBuffer is another parameter provided to the
     DeviceIoControlFile() function and is therefore controllable by
     the attacker. The edi register contains the invalid address
     provided during the fuzz testcase.

     A write-what-where vulnerability can be leveraged to obtain
     escalated privileges. To do so, an attacker will need to
     allocate memory in userland that is populated with shellcode
     designed to find the Token for PID 4 (System) and then overwrite
     the token for its own process. By leveraging the vulnerability
     in BthPan it is then possible to overwrite the pointer at
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 with a pointer to our shellcode. Calling
     NtQueryIntervalProfile() will subsequently call
     HalDispatchTable+0x4, execute our shellcode, and elevate the
     privilege of the exploit process.

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     None. A patch is not likely to be forthcoming from the vendor.

5. Credit

     This vulnerability was discovered by Matt Bergin of KoreLogic
     Security, Inc.

                the vulnerability affects other versions of Windows.
   2014.04.29 - KoreLogic asks Microsoft for clarification of their
                support policy for XP.
   2014.04.29 - Microsoft says XP-only vulnerabilities will not be
                addressed with patches.
   2014.04.29 - KoreLogic asks if Microsoft intends to address the
                vulnerability report.
   2014.04.29 - Microsoft opens case to investigate the impact of the
                vulnerability on non-XP systems.
   2014.05.06 - Microsoft asks again if this vulnerability affects
                non-XP systems.
   2014.05.14 - KoreLogic informs Microsoft that the vulnerability
                report is for XP and other Windows versions have not
                been examined.
   2014.06.11 - KoreLogic informs Microsoft that 30 business days have
                passed since vendor acknowledgement of the initial
                report.  KoreLogic requests CVE number for the
                vulnerability, if there is one. KoreLogic also
                requests vendor's public identifier for the
                vulnerability along with the expected disclosure date.
   2014.06.11 - Microsoft informs KoreLogic that the vulnerability
                does not impact any "up-platform" products. Says they
                are investigating embedded platforms. Does not provide
                CVE number.
   2014.06.24 - Microsoft contacts KoreLogic to say that they confused
                the report of this vulnerability with another and that
                they cannot reproduce the described behavior.
                Microsoft asks for an updated Proof-of-Concept, crash
                dumps or any further analysis of the vulnerability
                that KoreLogic can provide.
   2014.06.25 - KoreLogic provides Microsoft with an updated
                Proof-of-Concept which demonstrates using the
                vulnerability to spawn a system shell.
   2014.06.30 - KoreLogic asks Microsoft for confirmation of their
                receipt of the updated PoC. Also requests that a CVE
                ID be issued for this vulnerability.
   2014.07.02 - 45 business days have elapsed since Microsoft
                acknowledged receipt of the vulnerability report and
                PoC.

the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## In this article

## Vulnerability in Message Queuing Service Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2993254)

Published: October 14, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker sends a specially crafted input/output control (IOCTL) request to the Message Queuing service. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to full access to the affected system. By default, the Message Queuing component is not installed on any affected operating system edition and can only be enabled by a user with administrative privileges. Only customers who manually enable the Message Queuing component are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the Message Queuing service validates input data before passing the data to the allocated buffer. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating),\*\*\*\*Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the Affected Software table later in this bulletin.

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, the Message Queuing component is not installed on any affected operating system edition and can only be enabled by a user with administrative privileges. Only customers who manually enable the Message Queuing component are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability could not be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Disable the Message Queuing Service:**

* Interactively

  Disabling the Message Queuing service will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Message Queuing service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Control Panel**. Alternatively, point to **Settings**, and then click **Control Panel**.
  2. Double-click **Administrative Tools**. Alternatively, click **Switch to Classic View** and then double-click **Administrative Tools**.
  3. Double-click **Services**.
  4. Double-click **Message Queuing**.
  5. In the **Startup type** list, click **Disabled**.
  6. Click **Stop**, and then click **OK**.
* By Group Policy:

  Disable the Message Queuing service by using the Group Policy settings. You can disable the startup of this service at either the local, site, domain, or organizational-unit level by using Group Policy object functionality in Microsoft Windows 2000 domain environments or in Windows Server 2003 domain environments.

  **Note** You may also review the Windows Server 2003 Security Guide. This guide includes information about how to disable services.
  For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft websites:

  + [Step-by-Step Guide to Understanding the Group Policy Feature Set](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb742376.aspx)
  + [Windows 2000 Group Policy](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/bb742376.aspx)
  + [Group Policy in Windows Server 2003](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/management/grouppolicy/default.mspx)
* You can also stop and disable the MSMQ service by using the following command at the command prompt (available in Windows XP and in the Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit):

  ```
  Sc stop MSMQ & sc config MSMQ start= disabled

  ```

**How to undo the workaround:** Use the steps above to set the Startup Type to Automatic and start the service.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the Message Queuing service improperly handles objects in memory by inadvertently allowing overwrite.

**What is Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ)?**

Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) technology enables applications that are running at different times to communicate across heterogeneous networks and across systems that may be temporarily offline. Applications send messages to queues and read messages from queues. Message Queuing provides guaranteed message delivery, efficient routing, security, and priority-based messaging. It can be used to implement solutions for both asynchronous and synchronous messaging scenarios. For more information, see the Microsoft Message Queuing product documentation.

**What is an input/output control (IOCTL)?**

Windows provides the ability for applications to directly request services of device drivers. The interface through which this is done is called an input/output control, or IOCTL.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted IOCTL request to the Message Queuing service. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to full access to the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and servers running the Message Queuing service are primarily at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the MSMQ service validates input data before passing the data to the allocated buffer.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2014-4971](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4971).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

Title: Microsoft XP SP3 MQAC.sys Arbitrary Write Privilege Escalation
Advisory ID: KL-001-2014-003
Publication Date: 2014.07.18
Publication URL: https://www.korelogic.com/Resources/Advisories/KL-001-2014-003.txt

1. Vulnerability Details

     Affected Vendor: Microsoft
     Affected Product: MQ Access Control
     Affected Versions: 5.1.0.1110
     Platform: Microsoft Windows XP SP3
     CWE Classification: CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition
     Impact: Privilege Escalation
     Attack vector: IOCTL
     CVE ID: CVE-2014-4971

2. Vulnerability Description

     A vulnerability within the MQAC module allows an attacker to
     inject memory they control into an arbitrary location they
     define. This can be used by an attacker to overwrite
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 and execute arbitrary code by subsequently
     calling NtQueryIntervalProfile.

3. Technical Description

     A userland process can create a handle into the MQAC device and
     subsequently make DeviceIoControlFile() calls into that device.
     During the IRP handler routine for 0x1965020f the user provided
     OutputBuffer address is not validated. This allows an attacker
     to specify an arbitrary address and write (or overwrite) the
     memory residing at the specified address. This is classically
     known as a write-what-where vulnerability and has well known
     exploitation methods associated with it.

     A stack trace from our fuzzing can be seen below. In our
     fuzzing testcase, the specified OutputBuffer in the
     DeviceIoControlFile() call is 0xffff0000.

STACK_TEXT:
b1c4594c 8051cc7f 00000050 ffff0000 00000001 nt!KeBugCheckEx+0x1b
b1c459ac 805405d4 00000001 ffff0000 00000000 nt!MmAccessFault+0x8e7

b1c45ad8 80575d11 81ebb558 82377e48 82240510 nt!IopSynchronousServiceTail+0x70
b1c45b80 8056e57c 000006a4 00000000 00000000 nt!IopXxxControlFile+0x5e7
b1c45bb4 b1aea17e 000006a4 00000000 00000000 nt!NtDeviceIoControlFile+0x2a

     Reviewing the FOLLOWUP_IP value from the WinDBG '!analyze -v'
     command shows the fault originating in the mqac driver.

OLLOWUP_IP:
mqac!AC2QM+5d
b230af37 891e            mov     dword ptr [esi],ebx

     Reviewing the TRAP_FRAME at the time of crash we can see
     IopCompleteRequest() copying data from InputBuffer into the
     OutputBuffer. InputBuffer is another parameter provided to the
     DeviceIoControlFile() function and is therefore controllable by
     the attacker. The edi register contains the invalid address
     provided during the fuzz testcase.

TRAP_FRAME:  b1c459c4 -- (.trap 0xffffffffb1c459c4)
ErrCode = 00000002
eax=b1c45a58 ebx=00000000 ecx=ffff0000 edx=82377e48 esi=ffff0000 edi=00000000
eip=b230af37 esp=b1c45a38 ebp=b1c45a68 iopl=0         nv up ei pl zr na pe nc
cs=0008  ss=0010  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=0030  gs=0000             efl=00010246
mqac!AC2QM+0x5d:
b230af37 891e            mov     dword ptr [esi],ebx  ds:0023:ffff0000=????????

     A write-what-where vulnerability can be leveraged to obtain
     escalated privileges. To do so, an attacker will need to
     allocate memory in userland that is populated with shellcode
     designed to find the Token for PID 4 (System) and then overwrite
     the token for its own process. By leveraging the vulnerability
     in MQAC it is then possible to overwrite the pointer at
     HalDispatchTable+0x4 with a pointer to our shellcode. Calling
     NtQueryIntervalProfile() will subsequently call
     HalDispatchTable+0x4, execute our shellcode, and elevate the
     privilege of the exploit process.

4. Mitigation and Remediation Recommendation

     None. A patch is not likely to be forthcoming from the vendor.

5. Credit

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
