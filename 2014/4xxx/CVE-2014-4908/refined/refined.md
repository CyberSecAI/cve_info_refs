Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4908:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']` variable within the `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` tag in the `template.php` file. This variable is directly incorporated into the URL, without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. By manipulating the `REQUEST_URI`, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the meta refresh tag. This code is then executed when the page loads or refreshes, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful attack would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `REQUEST_URI`. This can be manipulated by directly crafting a URL containing the malicious JavaScript code. For example,  `GET pnp/$item?996fb"><script>alert(1)</script><"951e1=1` as shown in the commit message for `e4a19768a5c5e5b1276caf3dd5bb721a540ec014`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable PNP4Nagios instance. No special user privileges are needed.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability in the `REQUEST_URI` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability was addressed in commit `cb925073edeeb97eb4ce61a86cdafccc9b87f9bb` where the vulnerable `url=<?php echo $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ?>` part of the meta refresh tag was removed.
- The vulnerability is present in `share/pnp/application/views/template.php`.
- The fix for the similar vulnerability in `kohana_error_page.php` was assigned CVE-2014-4907.
- The commit message for the fix states that "Since we want to refresh to the same page there is no need to set the URI".
- The vulnerability was addressed by removing the potentially malicious URI from the meta refresh tag rather than sanitizing it.
