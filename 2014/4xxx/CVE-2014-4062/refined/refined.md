- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because Microsoft .NET Framework does not properly implement the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature. Specifically, it does not ensure that affected versions properly implement ASLR.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A security feature bypass vulnerability is present due to the improper implementation of ASLR.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the ASLR security feature. This bypass does not directly allow arbitrary code execution. However, it can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (e.g., remote code execution) to run arbitrary code by making it easier to predict memory locations.

- **Attack vectors**:  The primary attack vector is a web-browsing scenario where a user visits a specially crafted website containing malicious content that exploits the vulnerability. This content can be hosted on compromised or user-content accepting websites. The attacker would have to convince the user to visit the malicious site, e.g. by tricking them into clicking a link. The affected .NET Framework component is loaded when a user visits a malicious webpage using a web browser capable of instantiating COM components (e.g., Internet Explorer)

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to host a malicious website or embed malicious content into a website visited by the target.
    - The attacker needs to convince a user with an affected version of the .NET Framework to visit the malicious website.
    - The attacker may need to chain this vulnerability with another, like a remote code execution vulnerability, to achieve arbitrary code execution.
