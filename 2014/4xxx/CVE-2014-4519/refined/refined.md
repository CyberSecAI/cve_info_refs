*   **URL parameter injection:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the `page` parameter of the `printAdminUsersList_Footer.tpl.php` file.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The injected JavaScript code is reflected back to the user in the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users, making it easily exploitable.
*   **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific URL containing the malicious script.
