  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw was discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS library.",
    "weaknesses": "The vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to mount a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.",
    "impact": "Denial of service against PolarSSL servers that offer GCM ciphersuites. Potentially clients are affected too if a malicious server decides to execute the denial of service attack against its clients.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with a PolarSSL server offering GCM ciphersuites. Potentially a malicious server can exploit the vulnerability against clients."
