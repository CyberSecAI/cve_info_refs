Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-4727:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the DHCP hostname field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The web server is vulnerable to a DoS attack due to its inability to handle excessively long HTTP header values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The web interface of the TP-LINK router doesn't properly sanitize the DHCP hostname field. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is then stored and executed when an administrator views the DHCP client page.
*   **DoS:** The web server doesn't handle overly long HTTP header values and becomes unresponsive when such values are sent within a GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stored XSS:** When exploited, an attacker could potentially hijack administrator sessions, steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the administrator's browser. This could lead to further compromise of the router or the network it manages.
*   **DoS:** Exploitation of the DoS vulnerability can render the router's web interface inaccessible, disrupting management and potentially the device's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code by setting a DHCP hostname that is then stored by the router. When the administrator views the DHCP client page, the script is executed within their browser, compromising the administrator's session.
*   **DoS:**  An attacker can send a GET request containing an extra header with an extremely long value. This could be done remotely or locally, overloading the webserver on the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:**  An attacker needs to be able to influence the DHCP hostname set on the network. This could be through control of a DHCP client, or possibly by influencing the DHCP server's settings. This would most likely happen on the local network.
*   **DoS:** An attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests to the device, which could be from the local network, or from the outside if the web interface is accessible through the WAN connection.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability affects the TP-LINK N750 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router (TL-WDR4300) and potentially other devices.
*   The affected firmware versions include at least version 130617, and possibly earlier ones.
*   The vendor released a fix in firmware version 140916.
*   Proof-of-concept links are provided, showing the ability to trigger the vulnerabilities.
