{
  "CVE-2014-4140": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not properly implement the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature.",
    "Weaknesses": "Improper implementation of ASLR",
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to bypass the ASLR security feature. The bypass could then be used in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could tie this ASLR bypass vulnerability to another vulnerability, usually a remote code execution vulnerability. The additional vulnerability would take advantage of the ASLR bypass for exploitation. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to exploit an additional vulnerability along with the ASLR bypass. The user must be using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer."
