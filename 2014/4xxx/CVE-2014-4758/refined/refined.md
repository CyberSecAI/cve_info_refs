Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-4758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access restrictions on service types when invoking a service using the `callService` URL. This means that services intended for internal use could be accessed by authenticated users without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper access control based on the service type. This allows unauthorized access to internal services.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Internal services, not meant to be exposed to general authenticated users, could potentially reveal sensitive information or functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Authenticated users could gain access to services that were intended for internal use only.
*   **Potential Information Exposure:** Accessing internal services could lead to the exposure of sensitive data or internal functionality.
*   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Depending on the nature of the exposed services, attackers might be able to further compromise the system or its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through the network via the `callService` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the affected application. No special privileges are mentioned to be required, beyond having a valid user account.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   IBM Business Process Manager Standard V7.5.x, 8.0.x 8.5.x
*   IBM Business Process Manager Express V7.5.x, 8.0.x 8.5.x
*   IBM Business Process Manager Advanced V7.5.x, 8.0.x 8.5.x
*   IBM WebSphere Lombardi Edition V7.2.x

**Mitigation:**

*   Apply the interim fix for APAR JR50215 for the respective product and version.
*   A new configuration option is available to enable other service types for backwards compatibility.
