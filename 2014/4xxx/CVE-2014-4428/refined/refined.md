The issue was addressed by denying unencrypted HID connections.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that unencrypted connections were permitted from Human Interface Device-class Bluetooth Low Energy accessories.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Bluetooth Pairing: The system allowed unencrypted connections for Bluetooth HID devices."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious Bluetooth input device may bypass pairing and establish a connection, potentially allowing the attacker to control the device or eavesdrop on user input.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Bluetooth spoofing: An attacker could impersonate a legitimate Bluetooth accessory."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device and capable of spoofing a Bluetooth HID device."
