The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller and Citrix NetScaler Gateway, including CVE-2014-4347.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in various parameters of the Citrix NetScaler web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** Multiple parameters across different pages of the web interface are vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Cookie Disclosure:**  The Apache g_soap module's error handler inadvertently includes the HTTP Cookie header in its error messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **XSS:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts to:
    * Steal user information (including session cookies).
    * Impersonate users.
    * Perform administrative actions on the appliance.
*   **Cookie Disclosure:** In conjunction with XSS, allows attackers to steal the HttpOnly SESSID cookie of administrators, granting them full access to the NetScaler appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **XSS:**  Manipulating URL parameters by injecting JavaScript code which will then be reflected back and executed in the user's browser.
*   **Cookie Disclosure:** Triggering an error in the g_soap module, which will output the cookie in the response, this combined with XSS can steal the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **XSS:**  Requires the attacker to trick a user into visiting a crafted URL containing the malicious script.
*   **Cookie Disclosure:** Requires the ability to send a GET request to the /soap endpoint and to inject javascript into a user's browser via XSS to steal the cookie.
* The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the NetScaler appliance and have a way to entice the user into following a malicious link.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory notes that the vulnerabilities were verified to exist in Citrix NetScaler VPX 10.0, which was the most recent version at the time of discovery. Versions before 10.1-126.12 and 9.3-62.4 were also confirmed vulnerable according to the vendor.
*   The advisory provides specific proof-of-concept examples for both cookie disclosure and reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
*   The document includes a timeline of vendor communication, highlighting the delay in releasing a fix.
