Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2014-4244 is an insufficient implementation of RSA "blinding" within the OpenJDK Security component. RSA blinding is a technique used to protect against timing attacks by randomizing the input to the RSA private key operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Blinding:** The RSA implementation did not adequately randomize the input during private key operations. This weakness allowed timing variations to become noticeable to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker capable of measuring the timing differences of RSA private key operations could potentially leak information about the keys used.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Timing Analysis:** The attack vector involves analyzing the time it takes to perform cryptographic operations. By observing subtle differences in processing time, an attacker can gain insight into the underlying cryptographic processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Timing Measurement:** The attacker must be able to accurately measure the timing of RSA private key operations. This might require the attacker to be on the same machine, network or be able to make network requests and measure the time they take to be fulfilled.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Components:** The vulnerability specifically affects the RSA algorithm within the OpenJDK Security component. This vulnerability impacted multiple versions of OpenJDK and JRockit, as well as various IBM Java SDKs.
*   **Patching:** Updates for various Java implementations were released to fix this issue, these included OpenJDK, Oracle Java SE, and IBM Java SDK. The patches improve the blinding of RSA operations to prevent timing attacks.
*   **Mitigation**:  No workarounds are mentioned in the documents, only fixes/patches are provided.
*   **Specific Affected Products (from various sources):**
    *   OpenJDK
    *   Oracle Java SE (5u71, 6.0u81, 7.0u65, 8.0u11)
    *   IBM Java SDK
    *   IBM WebSphere Application Server
    *   IBM Multi-Enterprise Integration Gateway
    *   IBM Rational Service Tester
    *   IBM Rational Performance Tester
    *   HP-UX running Java 7
    *   HP-UX running Java 6
    *   Red Hat Satellite
    *   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server

This vulnerability is not a code execution flaw or does not allow for direct modification of data or system settings. It is a side-channel attack, thus, it might require a sophisticated attacker with the means to measure the execution time of specific instructions.
