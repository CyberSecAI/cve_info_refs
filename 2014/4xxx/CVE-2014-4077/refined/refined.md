Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Input Method Editor (IME) for Japanese loads dictionary files within sandboxed applications. Specifically, a flaw exists in how the IME component handles dictionary files, potentially leading to a sandbox escape.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sandbox Escape:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to escape the sandbox of a vulnerable application due to improper loading of dictionary files by the Japanese IME.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of input/data when loading dictionary files, leading to the escape.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to that of the logged-on user.
- **Full System Compromise (Potentially):** If the logged-on user has administrative rights, an attacker could install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights. This means the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system.
- **Compromise of Sandboxed Application:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to break out of a sandboxed environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** An attacker would need to convince a user to open a specially crafted file that triggers the vulnerable sandboxed application which leverages the vulnerable IME component.
- **Exploitation through Sandboxed Application:** The attack is not directly on the operating system, but through a sandboxed application that improperly uses the vulnerable Microsoft IME for Japanese component.
- **Requires User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the user has to open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Write Access:** The attacker needs authenticated write access to the system, to place the crafted file.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the technical skill to craft the malicious file or content that can trigger the vulnerability within the sandboxed application.
- **User Deception:** The attacker must persuade or trick the user into opening the malicious file, as there is no way for the attacker to force the action.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable IME Component:** The attacker must target systems with the vulnerable version of the Microsoft IME for Japanese installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity.
- Microsoft was aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability when the security bulletin was released.
- The provided document suggests using EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) as a mitigation method until the patch is applied.
- The patch addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Microsoft IME (Japanese) component loads dictionary files.
