How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

<video id=’video\_tag’ width=’560’height=’400′ controls autoplay>
<source src=’http://boliviaonline.flashmediacast.com:2232/live/livestream/playlist.m3u8′ type=’video/mp4′>
Your browser does not support the video tag. This text will be replaced. Streaming solutions by Primcast – Shoutcast hosting, Flash Streaming

### [Sticking with JW5. Version 6 a big disappointment.](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sticking-with-jw5-version-6-a-big-disappointment/)

[Pádraig Ó Beirn](https://profiles.wordpress.org/padraigbeirne/ "Posts by Pádraig Ó Beirn")

Bought JW Player 6 and after extensive testing haven’t used it. It is much more difficult to customise skins for playlists and has less player setting options.
While JW6 Premium gives the ability to remove the logo they’ve introduced a JW player text link if you right-click on any video. To remove it you have to manually add some tags to each of your WordPress shortcodes. Upgrading from version 5 means going back on all previous videos for the past couple of years and adding these tags if you want to remove the JW link.
There is an obvious move away from users who simple want a robust video player. It’s fine to move towards analytics, encoding and hosting if you don’t leave behind your one-website non-commercial user. Jeroen from longtailvideo states in another post that “basic video playback of an MP4 will become straightforward as HTML5 gains full adoption”. That may be true but I, for one, was a loyal user of JW and wouldn’t have even considered looking for an alternative until JW6.
The pricing structure is another big change and disappointment. The May survey of customers on pricing was totally slanted towards an SaaS hosting content model with pricing based on a set number of site and monthly plays. This is another reason why I will be keeping abreast of other players for when it’s eventually time to move on from JW5.
Some features which were “deprecated” in JW5 are being re-introduced such as horizontal volume sliders and <enclosure> but all-in-all it’s a huge disappointment and a step backward for me.
