The provided content is related to CVE-2014-4100.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. This could lead to complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights. An attacker could then install programs, view/modify/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince a user to visit the malicious website.
- Compromised websites: Attackers could also inject the malicious code into compromised websites, including those that accept user-provided content.
- Phishing: Attackers can use social engineering tactics like email or instant messaging with links or attachments that lead to the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or control access to malicious web content (or inject it into legitimate sites) and entice a user to access that content via Internet Explorer.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the user's system before exploitation, since the vulnerability executes with the user's rights.
