The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities related to hard-coded usernames in various SAP components, not a single CVE. It lists multiple advisories from Onapsis Research Labs (ONAPSIS-2014-011 to ONAPSIS-2014-019). Therefore, this content is **UNRELATED** to a single CVE. It's a summary of multiple vulnerabilities.

However, if analyzing the content for general vulnerability information related to hardcoded credentials, here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Hard-coded usernames and credentials within various SAP components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- Potential for unauthorized access due to these credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Depending on the specific component, the impact can include:
  - Confidentiality compromise (C:P)
  - Data Integrity issues (I:P)
  - Availability issues (A:P)
  - Some vulnerabilities have only Confidentiality impact (C:P), with no impact on Integrity or Availability (I:N/A:N)

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks (AV:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker typically needs some level of privileged access to the SAP system (AU:S) to exploit these vulnerabilities. The attack complexity varies, with some being Medium (AC:M) and others being Low (AC:L) or High (AC:H) depending on the component.
