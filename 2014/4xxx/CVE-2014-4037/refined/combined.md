Welcome to the past! ð»
Unfortunately, FCKeditor is no longer maintained. RIP â¤ï¸

Instead, you can check our new and powerful [rich text editor](https://ckeditor.com/) framework, **CKEditor 5**. It has a modular architecture, integrations with popular JavaScript frameworks and features like [real-time collaborative editing](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/capabilities/collaboration-features/).

Or, you can discover **CKEditor 4**, which is an enterprise-grade WYSIWYG editor with countless features and wide browser compatibility including the legacy ones.

[Take me to the future â¨](https://ckeditor.com)

We’d like to inform all FCKeditor users that we have just released FCKeditor 2.6.11. CKEditor’s granddaddy occasionally comes out of retirement for important security fixes, and in this case **version** **2.6.11** fixes a vulnerability reported by Robin Bailey ([Dionach](http://www.dionach.com/)). We strongly urge anyone still using FCKeditor to please upgrade, preferably to the latest[CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/download/)!

Besides the obvious security improvements, **CKEditor 4.4.1** includes a variety of new features not available in FCKeditor:

* [Totally redesigned code](https://github.com/ckeditor)
* [Inline Editing](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/demo/)
* [Widgets](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_widgets.html)
* [Advanced Content Filter](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_advanced_content_filter.html)
* [Online Builder](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/builder)
* [Improved look](https://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-4-Skin-Contest-Winner/)
* [Better browser compatibility](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_browsers.html)
