If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain full control over the system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince a user to view the website.\n*   Attackers could also leverage compromised websites, user-provided content, or malicious advertisements to host the exploit.\n*   Social engineering is required to convince users to visit the malicious website, for example, by getting them to click a link in an email or instant message, or open a malicious attachment.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   The attacker needs the ability to host a website or inject content into a webpage.\n*   The attacker must convince a user to visit the malicious website with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer."
