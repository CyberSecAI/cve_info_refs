## Vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Foundation Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (3000431)

Published: November 11, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary script in the context of the user on the current SharePoint site. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SharePoint Server sanitizes modified lists within the SharePoint mobile browser view. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3000431](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3000431).

## SharePoint Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability - CVE-2014-4116

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize page content in SharePoint lists. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SharePoint Server sanitizes modified lists within SharePoint mobile browser view.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could execute arbitrary script in the security context of the logged-on user. The script could then, for example, take actions on the affected SharePoint site on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the logged-on user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could modify certain lists within SharePoint to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince users to browse to the modified list.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems running an affected version of SharePoint Server that also support the mobile browser view are primarily at risk.
