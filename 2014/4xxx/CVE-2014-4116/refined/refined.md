- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize page content in SharePoint lists when viewed in the mobile browser view.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper sanitization of modified lists within SharePoint's mobile browser view allows for the injection of arbitrary script.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability could execute arbitrary script in the security context of the logged-on user. This allows the attacker to perform actions on the affected SharePoint site with the same permissions as the logged-on user.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by modifying certain lists within SharePoint and then convincing a user to browse to the modified list. This can be done by:
    - Hosting a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convincing the user to view it.
    - Utilizing compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content.
    - Tricking the user into clicking a malicious link in an email or instant messenger message.
    - Tricking the user into opening a malicious attachment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify lists within SharePoint.
    - The attacker needs to convince a user to interact with the malicious content they have created. This requires social engineering techniques.
