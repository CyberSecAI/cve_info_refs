- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A race condition in LoginWindow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The race condition could sometimes prevent the screen from locking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The screen might not lock, potentially exposing the user's session.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition within the LoginWindow process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to exploit the timing of events within the LoginWindow process. This likely does not require a remote attacker but might require some local access to the machine or the user taking certain actions that would trigger this race.
