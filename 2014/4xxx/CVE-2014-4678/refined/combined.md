| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1828684#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2020-04-28 07:01:24 UTC  ``` The safe_eval function in Ansible before 1.6.4 does not properly restrict the code subset, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted instructions. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for [CVE-2014-4657](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4657).  Reference: <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/5429b85b9f6c2e640074176f36ff05fd5e4d1916> <https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=ansible-announce/ieV1vZvcTXU/5Q93ThkY9rIJ> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/26/30> <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/07/02/2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1828684#c1)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-28 10:31:52 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2014-4678>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1828684#c2)  Yadnyawalk Tale    2020-05-22 16:08:27 UTC  ``` I think resolution is quite clear here, in any case, Red Hat CloudForms 5.10 (4.7) and 5.11 (5.0) do not ship `ansible` package, it is provided by the official Ansible repository.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1828684#c3)  Hardik Vyas    2020-05-26 05:15:24 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Ceph Storage and Red Hat Gluster Storage shipped ansible versions 2.4.1 and 2.3.2 respectively, which are not affected by this vulnerability.   ``` |  |

Use CVE-2014-4678 for the
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/5429b85b9f6c2e640074176f36ff05fd5e4d1916>
fix that was announced in the 2014-06-25 ansible-announce "Ansible
1.6.4 update - security release" message at
<https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=ansible-announce/ieV1vZvcTXU/5Q93ThkY9rIJ>

(CVE-2014-4678 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4657.)

Additional CVE IDs (at least two) will be assigned for:

A. The 2014-06-25 ansible-announce "Ansible 1.6.5 - updated security
fix" message at
<https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=ansible-announce/A1px5egCnGQ/jH6f5HM7kpkJ>

B. The 2014-07-01 ansible-announce "Ansible 1.6.6 - refinements to
previous security fixes" message at
<https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=ansible-announce/WKL7BY3qddo/JkJiNrZzy3AJ>

(At least for item B, there may have been distinct problems reported
by distinct discoverers, and per-discoverer CVE assignments may be
best if that information is available. It seems likely that that
information won't be available at the time when the CVEs are needed --
and probably individual independent researchers won't be publishing
separate advisories about subsets of the safe_eval problem -- so one
CVE ID for A and one CVE ID for B is a realistic outcome.)

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

The safe\_eval function in Ansible before 1.6.4 does not properly restrict
the code subset, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via crafted instructions. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an
incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4657.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

It was discovered that Ansible mishandled certain input. A remote attacker
could use this to execute arbitrary code.

# CVE-2014-4678

| **Name** | CVE-2014-4678 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | The safe\_eval function in Ansible before 1.6.4 does not properly restrict the code subset, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted instructions. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4657. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4678) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-4678); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2014-4678), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2014-4678), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2014-4678), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2014-4678), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-4678), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4678), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-4678), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-4678)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4678/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2014-4678)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2014-4678%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2014-4678%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2014-4678%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

It turns out that the fix was incomplete:

<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/5429b85b9f6c2e640074176f36ff0>

Upstream announcement:

<https://groups.google.com/forum/?_escaped_fragment_=msg/ansible-announce/ieV1vZvcTXU/5Q93ThkY9rIJ>

I think this warrants a separate CVE ID.  There is some debate whether
this actually crosses a security boundary, but upstream thinks it does,
after some consideration.

Note that the subsequent commit looks extremely suspicious as far as the
sandboxing is concerned:

<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/35368e531b36c800ff6e61fc79fcd9>

I'll try to figure out what's going on.
