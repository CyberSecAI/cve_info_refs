{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Unsafe parsing of action arguments in Ansible, allowing an attacker to inject their own options to an action by controlling variable data. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization when templating module arguments. This allows variables containing strings like 'src=', 'temp=' or 'validate=' to inject new parameters into the module's arguments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
       "Argument Injection",
      "Insufficient validation of templated input"
     ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the managed host. By injecting malicious parameters into actions like 'copy' or 'template', an attacker can exploit the 'validate' option to execute arbitrary shell code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
       "Network",
       "Control of Ansible playbook variables"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control Ansible playbook variables, which may include fact data, with\_fileglob data, or other sources. This can be achieved by compromising an Ansible managed host or by manipulating the inventory or other data sources used by Ansible."
