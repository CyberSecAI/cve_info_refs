Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-4418:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root cause:** A validation issue existed in the handling of certain metadata fields of `IODataQueue` objects within the IOKit framework.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient validation of metadata within `IODataQueue` objects.
*   **Impact:** A malicious application may be able to execute arbitrary code with system privileges. This means an attacker could gain full control over the affected system.
*   **Attack vector:** A malicious application running on the targeted device.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application on the targeted device to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Affected products:** iOS (iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch 5th generation and later, iPad 2 and later) and Apple TV (3rd generation and later)

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in how IOKit handles metadata within `IODataQueue` objects. Improper validation allows a malicious application to potentially inject code that would then execute with system-level privileges. This allows the attacker to completely compromise the device.
