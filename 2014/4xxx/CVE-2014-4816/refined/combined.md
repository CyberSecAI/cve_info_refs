## IBM WebSphere Application Server contains multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#573356

Original Release Date: 2014-10-08 | Last Revised: 2014-10-16

---

### Overview

IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the Hypervisor Edition, contains cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities.

### Description

| [**CWE-79**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')** - CVE-2014-4770  IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the Hypervisor Edition, contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Administrative Console.[**CWE-352**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** - CVE-2014-4816IBM WebSphere Application Server, including the Hypervisor Edition, contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Administrative Console. The application also provides a URL that allows authenticated users to directly create and modify their session variables ("Session Injection"), including CSRF tokens.IBM reports that the following versions are affected:     + Version 8.5 + Version 8 + Version 7 + Version 6.1 + Version 6.0.2  The CVSS score reflects CVE-2014-4770. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session. Additionally, a remote unauthenticated attacker may be able to trick an authenticated user into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request and may result in information leakage or modification. |
| --- |

### Solution

| IBM provides the following remediation guidance in their [security bulletin](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21682767):*The recommended solution is to apply the Interim Fix, Fix Pack or PTF for each named product as soon as practical.* ***Fix:*** *Apply an Interim Fix, Fix Pack or PTF containing APAR PI23055, as noted below:****For affected IBM WebSphere Application Server:******For V8.5.0.0 through 8.5.5.3:***     + *Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.0 or later* + *Then apply Interim Fix* [*PI23055*](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038403)  *--OR--*    + *Apply Fix Pack 8.5.5.4 or later (targeted to be available 8 December 2014).*  ***For V8.0.0.0 through 8.0.0.9:***    + *Apply Fix Pack 8.0.0.6 or later* + *Then apply interim Fix* [*PI23055*](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038402)  *--OR--*    + *Apply Fix Pack 8.0.0.10 or later (targeted to be available 16 February 2015).*  ***For V7.0.0.0 through 7.0.0.31:***    + *Apply Fix Pack 7.0.0.27 or later* + *Then apply Interim Fix* [*PI23055*](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038407)  *--OR--*    + *Apply Fix Pack 7.0.0.35 or later (targeted to be available 13 October 2014).*  ***For V6.1.0.0 through 6.1.0.47:***    + *Apply Fix Pack 6.1.0.47 and then apply Interim Fix* [*PI23055*](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24038404) |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
