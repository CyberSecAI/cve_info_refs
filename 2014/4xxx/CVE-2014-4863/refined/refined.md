Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-4863:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Arris Touchstone DG950A cable modem exposes sensitive information via the SNMP public community string by default.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The device leaks sensitive information through SNMP.
- **Default Configuration:** SNMP access is enabled by default with a public community string, making it accessible to anyone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can retrieve sensitive information, including:
  - WiFi passwords
  - SSIDs
  - WPA PSK keys
  - WEP keys

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network access via SNMP.
- Exploitation through SNMP queries using the public community string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SNMP queries to the vulnerable device.
- No authentication is required, as the public community string is used.
- The attacker needs to know the OIDs of the information they want to retrieve.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects ARRIS DOCSIS 3.0 / Touchstone Wideband Gateway devices, specifically identified with "HW_REV: 3; VENDOR: Arris Interactive, L.L.C.; BOOTR: 2.3.1; SW_REV: 7.10.131; MODEL: DG950A".
- Over 50,000 of these devices were found to be exposing SNMP to the internet, according to Shodan.
- The issue was discovered by Rapid7's Deral "Percent_X" Heiland and independent researcher Matthew Kienow.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using common SNMP query tools.
- Metasploit modules for this vulnerability were planned to be released later.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- Base Score: 5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)
- Temporal Score: 4.5 (E:F/RL:U/RC:UR)
- Environmental Score: 3.4 (CDP:ND/TD:M/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND)
