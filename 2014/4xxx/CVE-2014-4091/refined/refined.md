  "cve": "CVE-2014-4091",
  "source_0": {
    "summary": "This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and thirty-six privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user.",
    "vulnerability": "Multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.",
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.",
    "capabilities": "The attacker would need to host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate website to host the malicious code. The attacker would also need to convince a user to visit the website using Internet Explorer.",
    "affected_software": [
      "Internet Explorer 10",
      "Internet Explorer 11"
    ],
	"patch": "The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory."
