Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- Exploitation via compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content/ads.
- Social Engineering: Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious website by clicking on links in emails, instant messages, or opening malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one.
- They need to trick the user into visiting that site using social engineering.
- No special position is required, just ability to serve a malicious webpage to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is one of many addressed by security update MS14-012.
- The vulnerability is listed as affecting Internet Explorer versions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
- While many memory corruption vulnerabilities are listed in the advisory, CVE-2014-4112 is specifically mentioned as a vulnerability addressed by the update, but it was *not* listed as being exploited at the time of bulletin publication.
- Mitigations include running Internet Explorer in Enhanced Security Configuration mode on servers and using EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit).
- Workarounds involve disabling ActiveX controls and Active Scripting or setting security zones to "High."
- The update patches the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
