The provided document contains information about security updates for OS X Mavericks v10.9.5 and Security Update 2014-004. It includes details about multiple vulnerabilities that were addressed in this update, including CVE-2014-4403.

Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-4403:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The CPU Global Descriptor Table was allocated at a predictable address.
**Weakness:** Predictable memory allocation of the Global Descriptor Table.
**Impact of exploitation:** A local user can infer kernel addresses and bypass kernel address space layout randomization (KASLR). This weakens the system's security by making it easier for attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities.
**Attack vectors:** Local access is required. An attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs local user access.

The document states that this issue was addressed by allocating the Global Descriptor Table at random addresses.
