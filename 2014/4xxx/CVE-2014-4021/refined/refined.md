  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Memory pages used by the hypervisor that are eligible to be allocated to guests were not being properly cleaned before allocation. This could result in the exposure of sensitive data previously used by the hypervisor.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper data sanitization",
      "Information Leak"
     ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest could read data relating to other guests or the hypervisor, potentially including passwords, cryptographic keys, guest CPU register state and hypercall arguments. The leaked data is mostly administrative information.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious guest can read hypervisor memory through newly allocated or reused memory pages.",
    "required_capabilities": "A malicious guest needs to be able to trigger memory allocation by the hypervisor.  Initiating domain management operations and lifecycle events for the victim guest can increase the likelihood of leaking sensitive data."
