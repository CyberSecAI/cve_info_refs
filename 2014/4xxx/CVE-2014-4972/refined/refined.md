- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Gravity Upload Ajax 1.1 plugin does not filter file types prior to accepting an upload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote, unauthenticated attackers can upload arbitrary files, including PHP shells, leading to potential full compromise of the affected WordPress installation.
- **Attack vectors**: By submitting a crafted form, an attacker can upload any file to the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication and can be remote. The attacker needs to be able to submit HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
