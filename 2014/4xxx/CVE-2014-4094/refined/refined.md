Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4094:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs due to improper access of objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Memory Corruption: The core issue is that Internet Explorer does not properly handle objects in memory, leading to memory corruption. This can allow an attacker to overwrite portions of memory, potentially leading to malicious code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Email Attachments: An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by convincing users to open specially crafted attachments sent through email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host malicious content or send malicious attachments.
*   The attacker must convince a user to interact with the malicious content, such as clicking a link or opening an attachment.
*   No special privileges are needed, as the exploit runs with the same privileges as the user.
