**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the way Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, enabling them to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability when a user views it using Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or ads, which can then exploit the vulnerability when users visit these sites.
- **Phishing:** Attackers can trick users into clicking a malicious link via email or instant messaging, which then takes them to the attacker's website or opens a malicious attachment designed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to convince users to interact with the malicious content.
- They could do this by tricking users into clicking a malicious link or visiting a compromised site.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer.
- The provided Microsoft bulletin (MS14-052) addresses this vulnerability along with other vulnerabilities.
- The bulletin states that the vulnerability was privately reported
- The advisory also mentions that while server versions of IE are also affected, they are rated as Moderate risk due to Enhanced Security Configuration, which mitigates the risk.
