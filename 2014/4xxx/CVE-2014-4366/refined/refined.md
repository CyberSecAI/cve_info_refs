The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2014-4366.

**CVE-2014-4366**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mail application was sending the LOGIN command to IMAP servers even if they had advertised the LOGINDISABLED capability.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is related to a failure to respect the LOGINDISABLED IMAP capability. This allowed the mail app to attempt login even when the server indicated that login should be disabled.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Login credentials could be sent in plaintext, potentially exposing them to interception, particularly when connecting to servers that are configured to accept non-encrypted connections.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves an attacker intercepting network traffic between the Mail app and a vulnerable IMAP server. This is especially concerning with servers accepting non-encrypted connections.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the iOS device and the mail server. This could be achieved by being on the same network as the device or by compromising network infrastructure.
