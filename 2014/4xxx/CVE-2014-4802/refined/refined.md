Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4802:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Saved Search Admin functionality in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) does not use the current user's context when running saved searches. This results in the system returning results that the user is not authorized to see.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inadequate Authorization Checks:** The system fails to properly enforce access control restrictions when executing saved searches. It lacks proper context management, thus failing to filter results based on the current userâ€™s permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can potentially view sensitive information regarding tasks and instances within the system that they should not have access to. This includes tasks or instances that the user is not authorized to see based on their role and permissions, leading to a breach of confidentiality and data exposure.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is accessible through the "Saved Search Admin" tab in the Process Admin Console of the IBM BPM application. An attacker can exploit this by creating and running a saved search and thereby obtaining unauthorized access to tasks or instances.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the IBM BPM Process Admin Console.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create and run saved searches in the Process Admin Console.

**Affected products and versions:**
- IBM Business Process Manager Standard V8.0, 8.0.1, 8.5, and 8.5.5
- IBM Business Process Manager Express V8.0, 8.0.1, 8.5, and 8.5.5
