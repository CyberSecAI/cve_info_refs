      "content": "The provided document from Microsoft details multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, including CVE-2014-4083. The document states:\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n*   The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n*   Memory corruption vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.\n*   These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n*   An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user.\n*   If the current user has administrative rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n*   An attacker could host a specially crafted website to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer.\n*   Compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements could contain malicious content.\n*   The attacker would have to convince users to visit the malicious site, typically by clicking a link in an email or IM, or opening a malicious attachment.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n*   An attacker needs to host a malicious website or compromise a legitimate website.\n*   The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website via a social engineering technique.\n",
