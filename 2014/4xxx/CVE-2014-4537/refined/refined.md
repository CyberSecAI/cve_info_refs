Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `inpage.tpl.php` file of the "Keyword Strategy Internal Links" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `sort`, `search`, and `dir` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This means that malicious scripts injected through the vulnerable parameters are executed in the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** This can lead to session hijacking by stealing cookies.
*   **Website Defacement:** It may allow attackers to deface the website by injecting malicious content.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can use the XSS to redirect users to malicious sites, distribute malware or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through manipulating the URL parameters `sort`, `search`, and `dir` of the `inpage.tpl.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have any specific privileges or login to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Induce User to Click:** The attacker needs to induce a user (typically an administrator) to click the malicious crafted link. This can be done via phishing, or by posting the link on a forum or website where the victim may click it.

**Technical Details**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) URL demonstrates the vulnerability:

`http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/keywordâstrategyâinternalâlinks/inpage.tpl.php?sort=sort%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&search=search%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&dir=dir%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E`

This URL injects the JavaScript `alert(document.cookie)` into the `sort`, `search`, and `dir` parameters. When accessed, the JavaScript code will execute within the user's browser, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability and ability to read cookies.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable plugin is identified as "Keyword Strategy Internal Links" version 2 and potentially lower versions.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 28, 2014, after the vendor was contacted on January 21, 2014.
*   The plugin has no known fix.
