The provided content relates to CVE-2014-4993.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `Kernel#%x` (backticks) in `lib/backup/cli/utility.rb` to execute shell commands. The password, provided via the `password_file` option, is embedded directly into the command string without sanitization. This leads to two issues:

1.  **Password Exposure:** The password is exposed to the process table as an argument to the `openssl` command.
2.  **Remote Command Injection:** If the gem is used in a Rails application, unsanitized user input provided via `options[:password_file]` could lead to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Password Exposure:** Passwords are passed as command-line arguments, which are visible in the process table.
-   **Command Injection:** User-controlled input is directly embedded into shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can view the password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to encrypted backup data.
-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running the application if the gem is used within a Rails application context and the password file path is controllable by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
-   **Local Process Inspection:**  A local attacker with access to the process table can read the password by inspecting command-line arguments.
-   **Remote Command Injection:** A remote attacker can inject malicious shell commands by manipulating the `password_file` parameter when the gem is used within a vulnerable web application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Local Process Inspection:** Access to the process table on the system where the backup process is running.
-   **Remote Command Injection:**  Ability to control the input to the application, specifically the `password_file` parameter. This would likely require the gem being used in a web application context, and the password file path being supplied by user input.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The vulnerability exists in both `backup_checksum-3.0.23` and `backup-agoddard-3.0.28` due to code duplication.
-   The use of backticks/`%x[]` for executing external commands with unsanitized input is the core issue.
