| **CVE Name** | CVE-2014-4045 |

| **Description** | A remotely exploitable crash vulnerability exists in the PJSIP channel driver's pub/sub framework. If an attempt is made to unsubscribe when not currently subscribed and the endpoint's âsub\_min\_expiryâ is set to zero, Asterisk tries to create an expiration timer with zero seconds, which is not allowed, so an assertion raised. |

| **Resolution** | Upgrade to a version with the patch integrated, apply the patch, or make sure the âsub\_min\_expiryâ endpoint configuration option is greater than zero. |
