Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-4496:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `mach_port_kobject` kernel interface was leaking kernel addresses and heap permutation values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Information disclosure vulnerability due to the leak of kernel addresses and heap permutation values. This could aid in bypassing Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Maliciously crafted or compromised applications could determine addresses in the kernel, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
A local attacker using a malicious application can exploit the `mach_port_kobject` kernel interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to execute code on the target system. This could be achieved by running a malicious application.

**Affected Systems:**
The vulnerability affects:
*   iOS 8.1.3 on iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later
*   Apple TV 7.0.3 on Apple TV 3rd generation and later
*   OS X Yosemite v10.10.2
