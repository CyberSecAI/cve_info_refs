Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The filemanager plugin in Frog CMS 0.9.5 does not properly verify the extensions of uploaded files.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  Arbitrary File Upload. The lack of proper file extension validation allows users to upload files with extensions that can be executed by the web server (e.g., PHP).
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a complete compromise of the web application and the underlying server.
* **Attack Vectors:** An attacker, after authenticating to the Frog CMS, can upload a malicious file through the file manager plugin.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Frog CMS.
    * The attacker needs to access to the file manager plugin.
    * The attacker needs to be able to upload files.
    * The attacker can execute the uploaded files without authentication.
