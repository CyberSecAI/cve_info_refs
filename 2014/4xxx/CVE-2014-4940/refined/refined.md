Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-4940

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a Local File Inclusion (LFI) flaw within the Tera Charts WordPress plugin. The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `fn` parameter passed via HTTP GET requests. This allows an attacker to manipulate the filename and include arbitrary files from the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include local files by manipulating the `fn` parameter in the `treemap.php` and `zoomabletreemap.php` files.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the `fn` parameter, allowing path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../`) to be used to access files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, password files, or other arbitrary files that the web server process has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to vulnerable PHP files (`treemap.php`, `zoomabletreemap.php`) within the plugin, including path traversal sequences within the `fn` parameter.
    *   Example Attack URLs:
        *   `http://anant/wordpress_vuln_check/wp-content/plugins/tera-charts/charts/treemap.php?fn=../../../../../etc/passwd`
        *  `http://anant/wp_test/wp-content/plugins/tera-charts/charts/zoomabletreemap.php?fn=../../../../../etc/passwd`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, meaning no user login or prior access to the WordPress site is required.
*   **Basic HTTP Request Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP GET requests and manipulate URL parameters.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided trac changeset information shows that the vulnerability was addressed in version 1.0 of the plugin.
*   The fix involved sanitizing the filename by extracting the filename and extension, and then explicitly reconstructing the filename if the extension was xlsx or xls. This limits the attacker's ability to use path traversal.
*   The changelog in the readme.txt specifically mentions "Major security vulnerability fixed" in version 1.0.
