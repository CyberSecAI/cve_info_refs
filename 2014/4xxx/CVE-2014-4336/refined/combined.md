This issue was reported as fixed in 1.0.51:
<http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7188>

but it was found that the fix was incomplete with the full fix in 1.0.53:
<http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7194>

Should this get a second CVE or should we continue to use CVE-2014-2707?

Furthermore, another security issue was also fixed in 1.0.53:
<http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7195>

"
- cups-browsed: SECURITY FIX: Fix on usage of the
  "BrowseAllow" directive in cups-browsed.conf. Before, if the
  argument of a "BrowseAllow" directive is not understood it
  is treated as the directive not having been there, allowing
  any host if this was the only "BrowseAllow" directive. Now
  we treat this as a directive which no host can fulfill, not
  allowing any host if it was the only one. No "BrowseAllow"
  directive means access for all, as before (Bug #1204).
"

I believe this should receive a CVE.

Thanks

Subject: Re: cups-browsed remote exploit

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

The vulnerability that remains in cups-filters 1.0.51 (in the
generate_local_queue function, the input sanitization also needs to be
used for the host variable, but wasn't used for that) is assigned
CVE-2014-4336. This is fixed in cups-filters 1.0.53. This is the
vulnerability that exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2014-2707.

The second vulnerability addressed in cups-filters 1.0.53 (OOB
accesses in the process_browse_data function when reading the packet
variable, leading to a crash after a remote attack) is assigned
CVE-2014-4337.

For the third vulnerability addressed in cups-filters 1.0.53:

> - cups-browsed: SECURITY FIX: Fix on usage of the
>   "BrowseAllow" directive in cups-browsed.conf. Before, if the
>   argument of a "BrowseAllow" directive is not understood it
>   is treated as the directive not having been there, allowing

the vendor is announcing it as a security fix, so it is assigned
CVE-2014-4338. It also seems likely that the previous behavior was
actually an implementation error. (Apparently, this only allows
attacks against systems for which the administrator created a
malformed configuration file. A vendor could instead choose to have an
explicit security policy that the product's behavior is undefined in
the case of a malformed configuration file.)

Two additional notes:

> This issue was reported as fixed in 1.0.51:
> <http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7188>

The code fix itself seems to be

  <http://bzr.linuxfoundation.org/loggerhead/openprinting/cups-filters/revision/7189>

instead. Also, <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=871327>
mentions CVE-2014-2707, but the attachment in 871327 is apparently
only the CVE-2014-4336 and CVE-2014-4337 patch, not the CVE-2014-2707
patch. However, 871327 isn't directly trying to define what
CVE-2014-2707 means, so this can be considered a minor anomaly.
