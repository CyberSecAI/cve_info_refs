*   Specifically mentioned categories of attacks are:
    *   CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
    *   XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
    *   Local file inclusion
    *   Clickjacking

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The document mentions that the danger level is "not too high" because a valid ntopng user and password were required to exploit these vulnerabilities. However, it is still recommended to upgrade.
*   Exploitation of CSRF, XSS, or local file inclusion can potentially lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious behavior within the ntopng application.
*   Clickjacking can trick users into unknowingly performing actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

    *   CSRF: Exploiting the trust that a website has in a user's browser to send malicious requests to the web application.
    *   XSS: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *  Local File Inclusion: Exploiting vulnerabilities to include local files on the server.
    *  Clickjacking: Trick users into clicking on something different from what the user perceives.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The document explicitly mentions that attackers needed a valid ntopng user and password to exploit these vulnerabilities, suggesting that the vulnerabilities could only be exploited by authenticated users and that the attacker would require valid user credentials
*   The attacker needs to be able to send manipulated web requests or inject code, which means the attacker needs network access to the ntopng instance and a valid user credential.
