# [R6] Nessus Web UI /server/properties token Parameter Remote Information Disclosure

Info

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus was found to be vulnerable to a parameter tampering issue that could result in a limited information disclosure. The issue is due to the web server's /server/properties resource including information meant for authenticated users. This resource is designed to provide limited information about the scanner for API requests. However, manipulation of the 'token' parameter would result in it returning additional information about the scanner, primarily the version of the Plugin feed and a few other minor details. Of the list of items disclosed, most of it is intended to be disclosed and poses no risk to the system and does not cross privilege boundaries. The few items disclosed that may constitute a disclosure include the Plugin set (the version of the plugins installed), Notifications (basically indicates if Nessus 5.0 or 5.2), Scanner Boot Time (could be useful in timing attacks against other parts of system), and Status (if the scanner is currently processing plugins).

\* Please note that according to the [CVSSv2 guidelines](https://first.org/cvss/cvss-guide.html), a partial confidentiality disclosure consists of "*considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. An example is a vulnerability that divulges only certain tables in a database*". By this definition, Tenable does not agree that this issue warrants a 'partial confidentiality' rating. As such, we are rating this as 'none' which puts the CVSSv2 score at 0.0. Unfortunately, this is a limitation of CVSS in scoring as there is no way to abstract between a very minor information disclosure (e.g. server banner, path disclosure) versus something more serious. We recognize that this issue may pose a small risk in some environments. Finally, as always, Tenable recommends that Nessus web server interfaces not be exposed to external networks unless absolutely required.

### Solution

Tenable has released Web UI 2.3.5, available for Nessus 5.x that addresses this issue. Customers do not need to do anything special to receive this update, as it was distributed as part of the plugin feed around June 26.

# CVE-2014-4980 Parameter Tampering in Nessus Web UI – Remote Information Disclosure

**Title:** CVE-2014-4980 Parameter Tampering in Nessus Web UI – Remote Information Disclosure

**Product:** Nessus

**Vendor:** Tenable Network Security

**Version:** Nessus 5.2.3-5.2.7 – Web UI 2.3.4 (potentially lower)

**Vendor Notified Date:** June 24, 2014

**Vendor Resolved Date:** June 25, 2014

**Release Date:** July 18, 2014

**Risk:** Medium

**Authentication:** Not Required

**Remote:** Yes

**Description:**

A parameter tampering vulnerability exists in Nessus 5.2.7 and potentially below that allows remote attackers to retrieve potentially sensitive information from the server via the Nessus Web UI. By not checking each parameter, an attacker can retrieve information meant for authenticated users.

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability resulted in retrieving the following data without authentication, which can assist an attacker to launching further attacks:
 Plugin Set, Server uuid, Web Server Version, Nessus UI Version, Nessus Type, Notifications, MSP, Capabilities, Multi Scanner, Multi User, Tags, Reset Password, Report Diff, Report Email Config, Report Email, PCI Upload, Plugin Rules, Plugin Set, Idle Timeout, Scanner Boot time, Server Version, Feed, and Status.

**Exploit steps for proof-of-concept:**

1. Navigate to http://vulnerablehost.com/server/properties?token= and observe the returned content.
2. Navigate to http://vulnerablehost.com/server/properties?token=1 and observe the newly returned content meant for authenticated sessions.

**Vendor Response:**

Fix was added to Web UI 2.3.5 on June 25, 2014.
