Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation in the Administrative Console of IBM WebSphere Application Server, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious script into the web page served to a user of the Administrative Console.
*   The attacker's script executes within the context of the victim's browser session.
*   This can lead to various consequences such as:
    *   Stealing session cookies, which allows the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A remote attacker injects malicious scripts through the vulnerable administrative console.
*   The victim must visit a page with the attacker-injected malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious script into a vulnerable part of the WebSphere Administrative Console.
*   No authentication is required to inject the malicious script.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim into accessing the compromised page.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM WebSphere Application Server including Hypervisor Edition (6.0.2, 6.1, 7, 8, 8.5).
*   IBM has provided patches to fix the vulnerability, recommending the application of Interim Fixes or Fix Packs containing APAR PI23055.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Łukasz Płonka.
*   This vulnerability is associated with another vulnerability (CVE-2014-4816), which is a CSRF vulnerability in the same application.
