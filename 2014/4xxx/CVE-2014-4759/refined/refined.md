Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a default Enterprise Content Management (ECM) search service within IBM Business Process Manager (BPM). This service, part of the Content Management toolkit, was designed to allow users to search for document attachments. However, the service accepted any document query as input without proper sanitization. This flaw allowed users to craft queries that could return all documents, including their properties, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability lies in the ECM search service's failure to sanitize user-provided input queries. The service accepted and processed user-defined `select` and `from` clauses, allowing users to request information that they should not have access to.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerable service allowed authenticated users to potentially retrieve document properties that could contain sensitive information by crafting specific queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Information:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to document properties which could contain sensitive information. This could lead to a breach of confidentiality and potential misuse of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via the IBM BPM application using the Document List coach control's Ajax service.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the BPM application to invoke the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM Business Process Manager application.
- The attacker needs to be familiar with crafting document queries for the ECM search service.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Advanced, Standard, and Express editions, specifically when the IBM BPM document store feature is configured (which is the default configuration).
- A fix was released (JR50871) that updates the service to ignore user-provided `select` and `from` clauses. This limits returned document properties to a pre-defined set and prevents disclosure of user-defined properties.
- The issue was discovered on 2014-07-25 and fixed on 2014-08-29.
