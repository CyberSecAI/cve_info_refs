The provided content discusses a vulnerability in the Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer (LZO) and LZ4 compression algorithms.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the handling of Literal Runs within the decompression algorithm. Specifically, the size parameter 't' is incremented by 255 for each null byte (0x00) in a Literal Run. This can cause 't' to become a very large value.
- The code checks for buffer overflows using `(t + 15)` before passing t to the HAVE_IP and HAVE_OP macros, which check for input buffer and output buffer size respectively. When 't' is large enough, `t + 15` overflows, becoming a small value that passes the check, while t is actually a very large value, which will cause a buffer overflow when reading the input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow leading to buffer overflows. Specifically an integer overflow in the calculation of the size of the literal run leading to an out of bound write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) by writing to an invalid memory page.
- Adjacent Object Over-Write (OOW) leading to memory corruption.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible on certain architectures and platforms (especially in Libav and FFmpeg), but not universally.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted compressed data containing a large sequence of null bytes within a Literal Run to trigger an integer overflow, causing out of bounds writes during decompression.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to supply a specially crafted compressed data stream to the vulnerable LZO/LZ4 decompression routine.
- Understanding of specific implementation of LZO/LZ4 being used, to craft the specific payload.
- In the case of RCE the attacker needs to craft an input that writes to a useful place in memory and with useful values.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in multiple implementations due to code reuse (digital DNA), including Oberhumer LZO, Linux kernel LZO, Libav LZO, FFmpeg LZO, Linux kernel LZ4, and the core LZ4 implementation.
- The integer overflow is subtle and can remain undetected in highly optimized algorithms, even after decades of use.
- The attack may not be practical for 64-bit architectures because of the massive amount of input needed to trigger the overflow, unless the 64 bit value is truncated to 32 bits.
- FFmpeg and Libav-based projects are considered practically vulnerable to RCE due to the way they use LZO/LZ4.
- The size of the compressed data that is passed to the decompress routine is a factor in the exploitability of this vulnerability. For example if the implementation limits the buffer size passed to the decompressor the vulnerability may not be directly exploitable.
