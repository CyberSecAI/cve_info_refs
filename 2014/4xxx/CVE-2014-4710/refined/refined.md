```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not validate input to the "Full Name", "Email Address", "Password", or "Confirm Password" fields.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user input.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which will be executed when any logged-in user views the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or further attacks against the users of the application.
- Attack vectors: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the "Full Name", "Email Address", "Password", or "Confirm Password" fields via the "Create Account" page.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to access the "Create Account" page, which is typically available to the public.
