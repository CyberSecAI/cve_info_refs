Vulnerability ID: VU#301788 Vulnerability #1

Vulnerability Name: Toshiba Checkout Environment for Consumer-Service – CHEC
contains hardcoded DB2 password

Overview

Toshiba Global Commerce Solutions’ self checkout application CHEC contains a
file on the Client (Lane) systems that can be de-compiled to obtain a DB2
password for the CHEC’s Back Office System Server (BOSS).

Description

Toshiba Global Commerce Solution’s self checkout application CHEC contains a
file on the Client (Lane) systems that can be de-compiled to obtain a DB2
password for the CHEC’s Back Office System Server (BOSS).  The jar file has
hard-coded values that can be obtained and then used in conjunction with the
logic in the jar file to decrypt the userid and password for the DB2 database
on the BOSS.

Impact

An attacker could use the DB2 password to corrupt the database on the BOSS and
prevent the Lanes from functioning properly.  No sensitive data can be
accessed.

Solution

The previously-mentioned jar file is not actually used by the Lane and has been
removed in later releases of the Lane software.  Install the latest version of
the Lane Application to delete the relevant file.
