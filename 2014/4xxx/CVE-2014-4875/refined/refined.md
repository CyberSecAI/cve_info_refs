- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the presence of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the `CreateBossCredentials.jar` file of Toshiba CHEC software. This key is used to decrypt the `bossinfo.pro` file, which contains sensitive information, including the BOSS database credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key, which is a well-known security flaw (CWE-321). This allows an attacker with access to the vulnerable files to potentially compromise the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt the contents of the `bossinfo.pro` file, which includes the credentials for the BOSS database. With these credentials, an attacker could potentially corrupt the database, prevent lanes from functioning correctly. It should be noted that the vendor states "No sensitive data can be accessed."
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves gaining access to the `CreateBossCredentials.jar` file and the `bossinfo.pro` file, likely through remote access or local file system access if the attacker has already compromised the client/lane system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to access the client (lane) system, specifically the `CreateBossCredentials.jar` file and the `bossinfo.pro` file. They must also have the technical knowledge to decompile the jar file, obtain the hard-coded key and utilize it to decrypt the password.
