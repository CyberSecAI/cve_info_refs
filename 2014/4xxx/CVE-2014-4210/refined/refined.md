   - **Attack Vector:** Requires tricking a user into interacting with a malicious link or web page while they are logged into vCenter.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious link or web page that can be accessed by a logged-in vCenter user.

**2. CVE-2014-8371 (Certificate Validation Issue in vCenter Server):**
   - **Root Cause:** vCenter Server does not properly validate the certificate presented when connecting to a CIM server on an ESXi host.
   - **Weakness:** Inadequate certificate validation during the establishment of a connection.
   - **Impact:** A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack against the CIM service can be performed.
   - **Attack Vector:** MITM attack where the attacker intercepts and alters communication between vCenter Server and a CIM server.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between vCenter and the CIM server and must be able to intercept and modify network traffic.
