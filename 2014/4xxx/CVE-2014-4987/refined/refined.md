Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing validation for accessing the User groups feature in phpMyAdmin. This lack of validation allows an unprivileged, logged-in user to view the MySQL user list and manipulate the tabs displayed in phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper access control checks when accessing the User groups feature. This allows unauthorized users to access sensitive information and modify interface settings.
- **Information Disclosure:** Unprivileged users can view the list of MySQL users, which should be restricted to superusers only.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users can gain access to a list of all MySQL users, which is potentially sensitive data.
- **Interface Manipulation:** Users can modify the tabs displayed in phpMyAdmin for themselves, which may lead to confusion or other issues

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of phpMyAdmin
- **User Groups Feature:** The specific feature affected is the user groups functionality within phpMyAdmin

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Logged-in User:** The attacker must be a logged-in user of phpMyAdmin. They do not need to have administrative or superuser privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Configuration Storage Enabled:** The user groups feature must be configured for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
