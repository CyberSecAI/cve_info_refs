{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of length fields within malformed packets. When these packets are processed, the devices copy excessive data into the heap memory, leading to overwriting of other critical data and subsequent unexpected system restarts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap overflow vulnerabilities exist due to missing checks on the length fields of specially crafted packets.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities results in a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The devices will repeatedly restart if an attacker sends malformed packets continuously.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is remote. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted malformed packets remotely to the affected devices.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the target devices. No authentication is mentioned to be needed. "
