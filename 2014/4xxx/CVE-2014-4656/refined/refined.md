Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4656:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The content directly mentions "CVE-2014-4656" in multiple sources (Red Hat Bugzilla, Ubuntu security notice, and SUSE CVE pages). All these sources explicitly link the vulnerability to an integer overflow in the Linux kernel's ALSA control implementation. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**

   - The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) control implementation within the Linux kernel.
   - The overflow occurs in two areas:
      -  `id->index` during the creation of new ALSA controls (in `snd_ctl_add` function)
      - `numid` in `snd_ctl_remove_numid_conflict` function

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
    - **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow due to lack of proper bounds checking in the ALSA control code, specifically when allocating unique control IDs and their indices. This allows the `id->index`, `numid` and `kctl->count` variables to reach beyond their maximum values which causes a wrap-around.
    - The code did not check if the allocated numid would wrap around the maximum possible value for unsigned integers. If it does, `kctl->id.numid + kctl->count` would be smaller than `kctl->id.numid`, which is an assumption that is used in ALSA control code.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user could trigger the overflow, causing a system crash, an unkillable mount process or a denial of service. This could result from the kernel memory corruption due to the integer overflow.
   - **Memory Corruption:**  The integer overflow can cause memory corruption as invalid or out-of-bound values are being used, potentially leading to a system crash.
   - **Information Disclosure:** Memory disclosure could occur if the overflow leads to out-of-bounds memory access. This is possible in the user control put/get and tlv handlers.
   - Control becomes inaccessible, or unremovable.
   - Can bypass `user_ctl_count` limit, resulting in arbitrary controls being created, even if the limit is reached.

**5. Attack Vectors**
    - **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is through local access to `/dev/snd/controlCX` devices.
    - **Privileged User:** Exploitation requires a local privileged user or an application able to call the vulnerable ALSA ioctl calls.
    - **Specifically Crafted Input:**  Attackers must send specially crafted `SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE` ioctl calls to add/remove ALSA controls repeatedly, causing the `numid` or `index` variables to overflow.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
    - The attacker needs to have local access to the target system.
    - The attacker must have the ability to make ioctl calls to the ALSA control interface (i.e. they need to have access to `/dev/snd/controlCX` devices).
    - The attacker needs to be privileged, or have access to a program or application that runs with privileges, to create/remove ALSA controls.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions prior to 3.15.2
*   Patches were implemented in the Linux kernel to add checks and prevent the integer overflow.
*  The fix in the `snd_ctl_remove_numid_conflict` function introduces a check for the allocated `numid`. It prevents `numid` from wrapping around the maximum possible integer value. If it does, then the `numid` is reset to zero.
*   The fix in the `snd_ctl_add` function introduces a check to prevent allocation if the control's index range would cause a wrap around.
*   SUSE mentions that this bug class will no longer be fixed in all Linux kernels. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.
