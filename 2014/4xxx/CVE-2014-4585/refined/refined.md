Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of the `ajax_url` parameter in the `index.php` file of the WP Facethumb WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin directly outputs the unsanitized `ajax_url` parameter value into the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing cookies (allowing session hijacking).
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Potentially gaining control of the victim's account.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes the JavaScript payload within the `ajax_url` parameter.
*   The victim then has to visit this malicious URL for the attack to be executed. This could be achieved through:
    *   Social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing emails).
    *   Posting the malicious URL on forums or other platforms.
    *   By embedding the crafted URL into another website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated (unauthenticated access is sufficient).
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a URL that includes the malicious payload to exploit the reflected XSS. The attacker only needs the knowledge of the vulnerable parameter name to exploit.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the `index.php` file.
*   The provided exploit URL is: `http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/wp-facethumb/index.php?ajax_url=ajax_url'>alert(document.cookie)&`.
*   The `wpscan.com` content references the CVE and provides the plugin details and a link to an associated vulnerability.
