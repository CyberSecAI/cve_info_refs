Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from memory corruption issues within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it arises when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to a state where an attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is the improper handling of memory objects by Internet Explorer. This allows for memory corruption, which can then be exploited to gain control of the system.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  The vulnerability allows for remote code execution, meaning an attacker can execute code on a victim's machine remotely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
*   **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control over the system. This would include the ability to install programs, view, modify, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the same user rights as the user currently logged in. If the user has elevated privileges, the attacker inherits those privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** An attacker can host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker would then need to convince a user to visit the site.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised legitimate websites or websites that host user-generated content, thereby exploiting visitors.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can use social engineering tactics to trick users into clicking malicious links in emails or instant messages, or to open malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Web Content:** The attacker needs a platform to host a website containing the exploit.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince users to interact with the malicious content or website.
*   **No direct access:** The attacker does not need local access to the victim machine, as the attack can be carried out remotely.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for Internet Explorer on Windows clients and **Moderate** for Internet Explorer on Windows servers.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*   Multiple other memory corruption vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer are addressed in the same security bulletin (MS14-052), indicating a broader issue with memory management in the software.
*   The advisory mentions that Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers provides some mitigation.
*   The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can also help mitigate attacks.
