  "CVE-2014-4655": {
    "related": true,
    "text": "The second issue is that on one hand when a control is replaced the\nuser_ctl_count limit is not checked and on the other hand the\nuser_ctl_count is increased (even though the number of user controls\ndoes not change). This allows userspace, once the user_ctl_count limit\nas been reached, to repeatedly replace a control until user_ctl_count\noverflows.\n\n(aka \"SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE also gets the user_ctl_count\nhandling wrong\" ... \"first affected release predates the git history\")\nUse CVE-2014-4655.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `snd_ctl_elem_add` function in the ALSA control implementation does not properly maintain the `user_ctl_count` value when replacing user controls using the `SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE` ioctl. Specifically, when a control is replaced, the `user_ctl_count` is increased, even though the total number of user controls does not change. Additionally, there's no check to ensure the `user_ctl_count` limit isn't reached during replacement.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
        "Limit Bypass"
      ],
      "impact": "A local user can repeatedly replace a control until `user_ctl_count` overflows, which allows bypassing the user control limit, potentially leading to a denial-of-service by creating a large number of user controls.",
      "attack_vectors": "A local user with access to `/dev/snd/controlCX` can trigger this vulnerability by repeatedly calling the `SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE` ioctl.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local user access to the `/dev/snd/controlCX` device and the ability to make ioctl calls."
