{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Memory corruption"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability can gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially leading to complete system control if the user has administrative privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer. They could also leverage compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content. The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website (e.g. via a link in an email or instant message).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website and convince a user to visit that site with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer."
