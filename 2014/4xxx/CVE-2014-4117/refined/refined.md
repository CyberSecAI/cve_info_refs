Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4117:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Word improperly handles objects in memory when parsing specifically crafted Office files. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects during file parsing.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain full control of the affected system. This includes the ability to:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with limited privileges are less impacted, but still vulnerable to an attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Word file as an attachment and convince the user to open it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker can host a malicious website with a specially crafted file. They would then need to trick the user into visiting the site and opening the file. Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content can also be used to host the malicious file.
- **Microsoft Outlook:** Although Outlook is not directly vulnerable, it can be used as an attack vector if Word is the selected email reader. The attacker would send a crafted email that opens in Word.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Word file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious file, whether it is received via email or downloaded from a website. No user interaction is needed besides opening the file itself.
- The attacker needs no prior authentication or special privileges to perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" by Microsoft.
- The vulnerability was not publicly known when the security bulletin was released.
- There were no reports of the vulnerability being actively exploited when the security bulletin was released.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Microsoft Office, including Word 2007, Word 2010, Office for Mac 2011, Office Compatibility Pack, Word Automation Services, and Office Web Apps Server 2010.
- Microsoft recommends users install the security updates as soon as possible to prevent exploitation.
- Workarounds include not opening files from untrusted sources, or unexpected files from trusted sources.
- The vulnerability cannot be automatically exploited via email; user action is required to open the malicious file.
