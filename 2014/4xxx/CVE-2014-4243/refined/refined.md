It mentions CVE-2014-4243 in the context of MySQL, stating that the update fixes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2014-4243. The advisory notes that none of the MySQL vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable without authentication and states that this specific issue is related to ENFED. The risk matrix provides additional information:\n\n*   **CVE-2014-4243:**\n    *   **Component:** MySQL Server\n    *   **Protocol:** MySQL Protocol\n    *   **Sub-component:** ENFED\n    *  **Remote Exploit without Auth?:** No\n   *   **CVSS Base Score:** 2.8\n    *  **Access Vector:** Network\n    *   **Access Complexity:** Medium\n    *   **Authentication:** Multiple\n    *   **Confidentiality Impact:** None\n    *   **Integrity Impact:** None\n    *   **Availability Impact:** Partial+\n\nThis suggests that the vulnerability requires a network connection, is of medium complexity, multiple authentication is needed, has no confidentiality or integrity impact but does have a potential for partial impact on availability."
