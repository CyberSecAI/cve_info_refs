Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-4555

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `font-form.php` file within the Style It WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `mode` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `mode` parameter of the `font-form.php` file. This code is then executed by the victim's browser when the page loads, as the injected code is directly reflected back in the response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session when they visit the vulnerable page. This enables a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   **Credential Theft:**  Capturing user login credentials.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or serving malware.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Altering the appearance or content of the website.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `font-form.php` file with a crafted `mode` parameter containing the malicious script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges. They simply need to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into accessing it.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click on the malicious URL. This could be facilitated through social engineering, spam emails or other means to get the victim to visit the crafted link.

**Additional Notes:**
* The plugin is no longer available on the WordPress plugin repository
* The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 25, 2014 after the plugin was closed.
* There is no known fix for this vulnerability.
* The provided examples demonstrate how an attacker could inject javascript using the mode parameter.
