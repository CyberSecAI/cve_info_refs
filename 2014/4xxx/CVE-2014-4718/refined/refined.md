Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-4718:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Lunar CMS application lacks proper input validation and sanitization for user-supplied data, and it does not perform validity checks on HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The application allows certain actions to be performed via HTTP requests without validating the origin of the requests.
*  **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Input provided through the 'subject' and 'email' POST parameters of the 'Contact Form' module is not sanitized before being displayed back to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability to perform actions with the privileges of a logged-in user. This includes the ability to create new administrative users.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and script code into the user's browser session, leading to actions such as session hijacking (cookie theft) by executing JavaScript within the context of the vulnerable site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:**
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious web page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable Lunar CMS application.
    *   A logged-in user visits the attacker's malicious web page.
    *   The malicious form is automatically submitted in the background, triggering actions in the Lunar CMS application with the user's credentials and privileges.
*   **XSS:**
    *   An attacker crafts malicious input containing HTML and JavaScript.
    *   This input is submitted through the contact form.
    *   When the application displays the contact form information, the injected HTML and JavaScript is executed in the user's browser, allowing for malicious actions such as cookie theft.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:**
    *   Attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page.
    *   The victim must be a logged-in user of the vulnerable Lunar CMS.
    *   The victim must be tricked into visiting the malicious web page.
*   **XSS:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted input to the contact form.
    *   The victim needs to view the contact form where the malicious input is displayed.
