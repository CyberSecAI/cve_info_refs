Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-4165:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization/filtering in the `title` parameter within the ntop web interface when handling links to the `rrdPlugin`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML code. This injected code can be executed in the context of the user's browser session when they access the affected ntop web interface.
-  This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Phishing attacks
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other client-side attacks
  
**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `title` parameter of the link to `plugins/rrdPlugin`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs that include the XSS payload in the `title` parameter.
- The attacker needs to entice users of the ntop web interface to visit the malicious link (e.g. through phishing, social engineering, or by injecting the link into a vulnerable site the user visits).
