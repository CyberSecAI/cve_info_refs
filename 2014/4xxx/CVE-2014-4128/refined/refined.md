      "details": "The provided content from Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-056 directly addresses CVE-2014-4128.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory.\n\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer.\n\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution in the context of the current user. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially taking complete control of an affected system if the user has administrative rights. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n- **Attack vectors**: The primary attack vector is through a web-based scenario. An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker would then need to convince a user to visit the malicious site. This could be achieved through various means such as a link in an email or instant message, or by exploiting compromised websites and those that host user-provided content.\n\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious code into a compromised website, and must be able to convince users to visit the website using an affected version of Internet Explorer. The attacker does not need to be on the same network but needs to trick the user into visiting the attacker-controlled content.",
