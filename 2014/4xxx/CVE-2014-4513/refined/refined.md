Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4513:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `offline.php` file of the Activehelper Livehelp WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `MESSAGE`, `EMAIL`, and `NAME` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting. This means that user-provided input is directly included in the output without any form of sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
  - Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser visiting a page containing the vulnerable content. This could lead to:
    - Stealing of session cookies
    - Redirection of users to malicious sites
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Other malicious actions depending on the attacker's intentions

**Attack vectors:**
  - The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload in vulnerable parameters (`MESSAGE`, `EMAIL`, `NAME`). The attacker would then need to get a victim to click on the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with malicious payloads.
   - The attacker has to be able to deliver the malicious URL to the victim and convince them to click on it.
   - No authentication is required for this vulnerability, which means an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this.
   - The vulnerable script `offline.php` needs to be accessible via HTTP request, which is the default case for WordPress plugins.

**Additional details:**

-   The vulnerable parameters are `MESSAGE`, `EMAIL`, and `NAME`.
-   The provided proof-of-concept URL demonstrates how an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these parameters using the following structure `http://127.0.0.1/wp-content/plugins/activehelper-livehelp/server/offline.php?MESSAGE=MESSAGE%22%3E%3C/textarea%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&DOMAINID=DOMAINID&COMPLETE=COMPLETE&TITLE=TITLE&URL=URL&COMPANY=COMPANY&SERVER=SERVER&PHONE=PHONE&SECURITY=SECURITY&BCC=BCC&EMAIL=EMAIL%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&NAME=NAME%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&`
- The vulnerability is present in Activehelper Livehelp plugin versions 3.1.0 and possibly earlier versions.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.1.5
