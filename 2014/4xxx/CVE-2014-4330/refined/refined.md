{
  "CVE-2014-4330": {
    "Description": "The Dumper method in Data::Dumper before 2.154, as used in Perl 5.20.1 and earlier, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and crash) via an Array-Reference with many nested Array-References, which triggers a large number of recursive calls to the DD_dump function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the `Dumper` method in the `Data::Dumper` module not limiting recursion depth when processing nested array references.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The weakness is an uncontrolled recursion, leading to a stack overflow.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service due to stack exhaustion, causing the Perl interpreter to crash. In some contexts and architectures, there might be a possibility of code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through supplying a specially crafted data structure with deeply nested array references to the `Dumper` method.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `Dumper` method. This could be a context-dependent attacker if the code uses `Data::Dumper` to serialize data from untrusted sources."
