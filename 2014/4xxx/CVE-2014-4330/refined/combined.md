## Updated perl packages fix CVE-2014-4330

Publication date: 09 Oct 2014

Modification date: 09 Oct 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-4330](CVE-2014-4330.html)

## Description

```
Updated perl package fixes security vulnerability:

The Dumper method in Data::Dumper before 2.154, as used in Perl 5.20.1 and
earlier, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
(stack consumption and crash) via an Array-Reference with many nested
Array-References, which triggers a large number of recursive calls to the
DD_dump function (CVE-2014-4330).

Also, the Text::Wrap version provided in perl contains a bug that can lead
to a code path that shouldn't be hit. This can lead to crashes in other
software, such as Bugzilla.

The Text::Wrap module bundled with Perl has been patched and the
Data::Dumper module bundled with Perl has been updated to fix these issues.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-2916-1: Perl vulnerabilities

2 March 2016

Several security issues were fixed in Perl.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) - Practical Extraction and Report Language

## Details

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular expressions

with an invalid backreference. An attacker could use this issue to cause

Perl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-7422](/security/CVE-2013-7422))

Markus Vervier discovered that Perl incorrectly handled nesting in the

Data::Dumper module. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to

consume memory and crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-4330](/security/CVE-2014-4330))

Stephane Chazelas discovered that Perl incorrectly handled duplicate

environment variables. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass

the taint protection mechanism. ([CVE-2016-2381](/security/CVE-2016-2381))

## Go, Perl, scalability & database consulting... and more

Develooper LLC is a small (tiny even!) consulting shop. We do work
for both big and small, but we enjoy working with smaller companies
(or independent divisions of bigger ones). Some [services](/services/) we offer.

### Development and infrastructure areas of expertise

High traffic dynamic web sites and services, how to make the gears turn smoothly.

We can do or help with the "core architecture" planning, the implementation,
a combination or even the cleanup after someone else has been through.

Some projects are just a day or two of brainstorming and drawing on
a whiteboard, some a few weeks of development and some span years of
ongoing development and maintenance.

### Availability

Virtually all our "free" time goes to the NTP Pool and other existing
projects, so we're not in a position to take on new unrelated projects
at this time.
Consulting availability is strictly on a cool stuff, first-served
basis! :-) Our project schedule is ever busy and revolving, so we
might not have time on your schedule. Get in touch and we'll help
you in one way or another.

### Rate card

Expensive, but so worth it!

## Contact

[Best by email](/contact/)

## Assorted projects

* [GeoDNS](https://geo.bitnames.com/) DNS server
* The [NTP Pool](https://www.ntppool.org/) project,
  helping servers and gadgets everywhere keep track of time.
* [perl.org](http://www.perl.org/) [infrastructure](http://noc.perl.org/) and [CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/)

## Historical projects

* [stripe.js](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js) - Stripe (many years ago) took over my javascript wrapper for the stripe API.
* [qpsmtpd](http://smtpd.develooper.com/) - "the mod\_perl of SMTP" (developed by others for the last ~15 years!)

# LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH - LSE-2014-06-10 - Perl CORE - Deep Recursion Stack Overflow

=== LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH - Security Advisory LSE-2014-06-10 ===

Perl CORE - Deep Recursion Stack Overflow
-----------------------------------------

Affected Versions
=================
Perl v5.20.1 and below

Issue Overview
==============
Vulnerability Type: Stack Overflow
Technical Risk: high
Likelihood of Exploitation: low
Vendor: Perl
Vendor URL: <http://www.perl.org>
Credits: LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH employee Markus Vervier
Advisory URL: <https://www.lsexperts.de/advisories/lse-2014-06-10.txt>
Advisory Status: Public
CVE-Number: CVE-2014-4330
CVE URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4330>

Impact
======
When the runtime stack grows over its maximal size, a guard page on most modern
operating systems is hit causing the Perl interpreter to crash.
Depending on context code execution on some architectures might be possible
if certain conditions are met.

Issue Description
=================
During internal development a stack overflow was discovered when serializing
data via the Data::Dumper extension which is part of Perl-Core.
By using the "Dumper" method on a large Array-Reference which recursively
contains other Array-References, it is possible to cause many recursive
calls to the DD_dump native function and ultimately exhaust all available stack
memory.

Temporary Workaround and Fix
============================
Applications written in Perl should ensure that a sanity check on data
serialized by Data::Dumper is performed.

According to the vendor a patch is available and coordinated with downstream
vendors.

Proof of Concept
================
$ cat min.pl
use strict;
use Data::Dumper;

my $dumpme = [];
for (my $i = 0; $i < $ARGV[0]; $i++) {
        $dumpme = [$dumpme, "AAAAAAAA"];
}
print Dumper($dumpme);

It was confirmed that the overflow can be triggered via the XML::Parser
extension when parsing and dumping specially crafted XML-Documents.

## fix for CVE-2014-4330 present in blead

[Thread Next](/group/perl.perl5.porters/2014/09/msg220129.html)
From: **Ricardo Signes**

Date: September 18, 2014 13:25

Subject: fix for CVE-2014-4330 present in blead

Message ID: [20140918132525.GA8867@cancer.codesimply.com](/group/perl.perl5.porters/;msgid=20140918132525.GA8867%40cancer.codesimply.com)

```

I have just pushed up 19be3be6, which addresses CVE-2014-4330.

CVE-2014-4330 reports a stack exhaustion bug in Data::Dumper, when it attempts
to recurse without limit.  The bug was reported by LSE Leading Security Experts
GmbH employee Markus Vervier.  The fix was written by Tony Cook.  By default,
Data::Dumper will now limit recursion to 1000 levels, but this can be
configured by $Maxrecurse.

This patch has been pre-seeded to downstream vendors, who will apply it as they
see fit.  Expect a new release of Data::Dumper soon.

I believe the risk of any exploit arising from this bug to be quite low.

But this version of Text::Wrap is bogus. If you execute this command from the shell:  perl -MText::Wrap -wE 'say wrap("", "", "<http://193.35.206.163/issues/clients/index.php?issue=6239&order=issue_id&sort=desc>")'  you get the error "This shouldn't happen at /usr/lib/perl5/5.18.1/Text/Wrap.pm line 84."  This is a known bug in Text::Wrap 2012.0818 which has been fixed in Text::Wrap 2013.0426, see <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=79766>.  The fix is trivial, see the attachment. This is the fix which has been applied upstream.

=== LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH - Security Advisory LSE-2014-06-10 ===

Perl CORE - Deep Recursion Stack Overflow
-----------------------------------------

Affected Versions
=================
Perl v5.20.1 and below

Issue Overview
==============
Vulnerability Type: Stack Overflow
Technical Risk: high
Likelihood of Exploitation: low
Vendor: Perl
Vendor URL: <http://www.perl.org>
Credits: LSE Leading Security Experts GmbH employee Markus Vervier
Advisory URL: <https://www.lsexperts.de/advisories/lse-2014-06-10.txt>
Advisory Status: Public
CVE-Number: CVE-2014-4330
CVE URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4330>

Impact
======
When the runtime stack grows over its maximal size, a guard page on most modern
operating systems is hit causing the Perl interpreter to crash.
Depending on context code execution on some architectures might be possible
if certain conditions are met.

Issue Description
=================
During internal development a stack overflow was discovered when serializing
data via the Data::Dumper extension which is part of Perl-Core.
By using the "Dumper" method on a large Array-Reference which recursively
contains other Array-References, it is possible to cause many recursive
calls to the DD_dump native function and ultimately exhaust all available stack
memory.

Temporary Workaround and Fix
============================
Applications written in Perl should ensure that a sanity check on data
serialized by Data::Dumper is performed.

According to the vendor a patch is available and coordinated with downstream
vendors.

Proof of Concept
================
$ cat min.pl
use strict;
use Data::Dumper;

my $dumpme = [];
for (my $i = 0; $i < $ARGV[0]; $i++) {
        $dumpme = [$dumpme, "AAAAAAAA"];
}
print Dumper($dumpme);

## Binary packages built by this source

[libcgi-fast-perl](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libcgi-fast-perl):
CGI::Fast Perl module

CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm. It is

 specialized to work well with the Open Market FastCGI standard, which

 greatly speeds up CGI scripts by turning them into persistently running

 server processes. Scripts that perform time-consuming initialization

 processes, such as loading large modules or opening persistent database

 connections, will see large performance improvements.

[libperl-dev](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libperl-dev):
Perl library: development files

Files for developing applications which embed a Perl interpreter.

[libperl5.14](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/libperl5.14):
shared Perl library

This package is required by programs which embed a Perl interpreter to

 ensure that the correct version of `perl-base' is installed. It

 additionally contains the shared Perl library on architectures where the

 perl binary is linked to libperl.a (currently only i386, for performance

 reasons). In other cases the actual library is in the `perl-base' package.

[perl](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl):
Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language

An interpreted scripting language, known among some as "Unix's Swiss

 Army Chainsaw".

 .

 Perl is optimised for scanning arbitrary text files and system

 administration. It has built-in extended regular expression matching

 and replacement, a data-flow mechanism to improve security with

 setuid scripts and is extensible via modules that can interface to C

 libraries.

[perl-base](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-base):
minimal Perl system

Perl is a scripting language used in many system scripts and utilities.

 .

 This package provides a Perl interpreter and the small subset of the

 standard run-time library required to perform basic tasks. For a full

 Perl installation, install "perl" (and its dependencies, "perl-modules"

 and "perl-doc").

[perl-debug](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-debug):
debug-enabled Perl interpreter

debugperl provides a debug-enabled version of Perl which can produce

 extensive information about the interpreter as it compiles and executes

 a program (see the -D switch in perlrun(1)).

 .

 Note that this package is primarily of use in debugging \*Perl\* rather

 than perl programs, which may be traced/debugged using the standard

 perl binary using the -d switch (see perldebug(1)).

[perl-doc](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-doc):
Perl documentation

Perl manual pages, POD documentation and the `perldoc' program. If you are

 writing Perl programs, you almost certainly need this.

[perl-modules](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/perl-modules):
Core Perl modules

Architecture independent Perl modules. These modules are part of Perl and

 required if the `perl' package is installed.

 .

 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be

 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.

 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they

 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
