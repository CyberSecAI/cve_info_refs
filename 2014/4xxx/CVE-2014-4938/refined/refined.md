Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-4938

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `id` parameter within the `wp-admin/admin.php?page=wrp-add-new` page of the "Wp Rss Poster" plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The vulnerability arises because the plugin directly uses the client input `$_GET['id']` in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could potentially allow them to:
    - Access sensitive information stored in the database (user credentials, posts, etc.).
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain full control of the WordPress site by creating an admin user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL:
  `http://[target]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wrp-add-new&id=[malicious SQL payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has access to the vulnerable page.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the targeted WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable plugin is "Wp Rss Poster" version 1.0.0 (and potentially earlier versions).
- The vulnerability is present in the `wp-admin/admin.php` file, on the `wrp-add-new` page.
- The `id` parameter is the specific point of injection.
- The provided example of exploitation uses `union select` for demonstration.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 28, 2014.
- There is no known fix according to the wpscan source.
