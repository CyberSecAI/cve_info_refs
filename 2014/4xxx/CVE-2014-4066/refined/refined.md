Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4066:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it arises from the browser improperly accessing objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption: The core issue is that Internet Explorer's memory management allows for corruption of memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- Improper handling of objects in memory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means the attacker gains the same privileges as the user running the browser.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a malicious website containing specially crafted content designed to trigger the memory corruption vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- Compromised websites: Attackers could inject malicious content into legitimate websites, including those that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, to exploit the vulnerability.
- Phishing and social engineering: An attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website, typically by getting them to click on a link in an email or instant message, or by tricking them into opening a malicious attachment.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host malicious content on a website or inject it into a trusted one.
- Ability to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage using social engineering.
- No special privileges on the user's system are required prior to exploitation.
