Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4559:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `test-plugin.php` file of the Swipehq Payment Gateway WP e-Commerce WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize the `api_key`, `payment_page_url`, `merchant_id`, `api_url`, and `currency` parameters passed via a GET request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin directly outputs the unsanitized values of the parameters into the HTML output of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameters.
*   This can lead to various malicious actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Phishing attacks by displaying fake login forms or popups
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL. An attacker needs to send a malicious URL containing the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on a malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in version 3.1.0 and likely earlier versions of the plugin.
*   The plugin has been closed.
*   The CVSS score is 6.1 (Medium)

**Technical details:**

The provided example demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability:
`http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/swipehqâpaymentâgatewayâwpâeâcommerce/test-plugin.php?api_key=api_key%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&payment_page_url=payment_page_url%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&merchant_id=merchant_id%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&api_url=api_url%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&currency=currency%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&`

This URL injects a javascript alert into the page via the api_key, payment_page_url, merchant_id, api_url, and currency parameters
