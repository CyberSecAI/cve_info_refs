Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-4584

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `editFacility.php` file of the `wp-easybooking` WordPress plugin. The plugin fails to sanitize the `fID` parameter passed via the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `fID` parameter of the URL, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing cookies to impersonate a user.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker injects malicious code directly into the `fID` URL parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker may use social engineering tactics such as phishing to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** No prior login or user role is required. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who can craft a malicious URL.
- **Ability to generate or manipulate URLs:** The attacker must be able to construct a URL containing the malicious script and induce a victim to visit it.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable URL is `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/wpâeasybooking/admin/editFacility.php?fID=fID%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&`. This payload injects a script that displays the user's cookies, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable plugin is `wp-easybooking` version 1.0.3 and likely earlier versions.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 25, 2014.
- The plugin has been closed and no fix is available.
