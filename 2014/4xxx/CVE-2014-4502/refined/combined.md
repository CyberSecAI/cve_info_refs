## Description

[![@veox](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3036030?v=4&size=48)](/veox)[veox](https://github.com/veox)opened [on Jun 12, 2014](https://github.com/sgminer-dev/sgminer/issues/258#issue-35587528)

Reported by Mick Ayzenberg of DejaVu Security.

> When retesting against the current master branch of sgminer I discovered another vulnerability.
>
> Setting n2size to a value greater than 8 causes the memcpy in gen\_stratum\_work to copy data from the stack beyond that allocated for nonce2le (sgminer.c:5988). In my test environment I observed that setting n2size to a large value such as 65000 causes a segfault. This occurs because the memcpy hits non-readable memory above the stack and the application crashes.
>
> My recommendation is to set the acceptable bounds of n2size to greater than 0 and less than 9 when it is set (util.c:2407). I do not imagine this will cause any issues with pool compatibility since this limit is already enforced later in the code when sending accepted shares (sgminer.c:5534).

The file and line number references are from git master.

I tend to disagree here, since allowing large extranonces is useful for stratum proxies running huge farms, and for the future, to allow fast miners.

It has to be limited to prevent segfaults, but not to 8 bytes.

# CVE-2014-4502 : Invalid Handling of Length Parameter in Stratum mining.notify Message Leads to Heap Overflow

*From*: Mick Ayzenberg <mick () dejavusecurity com>

Vulnerability title: Invalid Handling of Length Parameter in Stratum
mining.notify Message Leads to Heap Overflow
CVE: CVE-2014-4502
Affected version: SGMiner before 4.2.2, CGMiner before 4.3.5, BFGMiner
before 4.1.0
Reported by: Mick Ayzenberg of Deja vu Security

Details:

A pool responds to a "mining.subscribe" Stratum request with a list of
parameters the application will use when mining.  Two of these
parameters are "Extranonce1", a hex-encoded string, and
"Extranonce2_size", the length of a nonce the miner can increment.

A malicious pool or an attacker who is in middle of a valid Stratum
connection can respond to a "mining.subscribe" request from a client
with arbitrary Extranonce1 and Extranonce2_size parameters.

An attacker can then send a valid "mining.notify" request to initiate
mining. The "mining.notify" message specifies parameters "coinb1" and
"coinb2", hex encoded strings of arbitrary length.

Cgminer, Sgminer, and Bfgminer will use the values provided to
calculate memory requirements for a valid block and copy parameters
into this allocated space.  By setting the value of "Extranonc2_size"
to be negative or large, an attacker can force the "parse_notify"
function to allocate less memory than expected and overwrite memory in
the heap.
