Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4992:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `cap-strap` Ruby gem not properly sanitizing user-supplied input for the `user` and `password` variables when creating a new user. This leads to two main issues:

1.  **Command Injection:** The unsanitized input is directly used in a system command constructed to create a user with `useradd`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system by manipulating the `user` and `password` inputs.
2.  **Password Exposure:** The password is exposed in the process table listing because it is used in a `perl` command to generate a password hash on the fly. Additionally, the password hash is not properly salted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The gem doesn't sanitize user input before using it in system commands.
*   **Command Injection:** User-controlled input can be used to inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Password Exposure:** The password is exposed in the process table, making it visible to other users on the system.
*   **Insecure Password Hashing:** The password hash uses the same hardcoded salt "sa" every time making it vulnerable to rainbow table attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary system commands, potentially gaining full control of the system.
*   **Credential Exposure:** The exposed password could be used to compromise other services if the user reuses passwords.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through user-supplied input to the `user` and `password` parameters of the `create_user` method.
*   If the `cap-strap` gem is used within a Rails application that accepts user input, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious values through the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the vulnerable `create_user` function. This is possible if the gem is used within an application that allows user input to create users.
*   The attacker would need to be able to execute commands, possibly through a web interface.
*   The attacker could potentially be a local user.
