Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4591:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `picasa_upload.php` file of the "WP Picasa Image" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `post_id` parameter is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS because it directly uses the `post_id` parameter in the page response without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter (`post_id`). This code will then be executed in the victim's browser when the crafted URL is accessed.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can potentially steal cookies, including session cookies, through JavaScript execution. This can lead to session hijacking and impersonation of the victim.
- **Phishing:** The injected JavaScript could redirect the user to a malicious website that harvests credentials, causing them to become victims of phishing attacks.
- **Malware Distribution:** The injected JavaScript can be used to download and execute malware on a victim's machine.
- **Defacement:** The injected JavaScript could alter the visual appearance of the vulnerable webpage.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the payload in the `post_id` parameter and trick a user into clicking it. This can be achieved through social engineering.
- **Other means:** An attacker could also potentially exploit this vulnerability in other ways depending on the context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Ability to craft malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the `post_id` parameter and be able to get a victim to visit the URL.
