Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4406:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability existed in Xcode Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. This occurs when a web application improperly handles user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit a malicious website. This can potentially allow an attacker to:
*   Steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
*   Deface the website.
*   Redirect users to malicious websites.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a maliciously crafted website. An attacker would create a website with the malicious JavaScript and then lure a victim into visiting that website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious website and convince a user to visit it. No special position in relation to the server or specific privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by improving the encoding of HTML output, which prevents the execution of injected scripts by treating them as plain text.
*   The fix is included in OS X Server v3.2.1 and v4.0.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by David Hoyt of Hoyt LLC.
