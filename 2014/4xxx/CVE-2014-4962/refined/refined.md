The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Shopizer webshop, but **does not contain specific information about CVE-2014-4962**.

The advisory details the following vulnerabilities:

1.  **Remote Command Execution:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Vulnerable Apache Struts versions (2.2.1.1 and 2.1.6) are used, which are susceptible to OGNL injection.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unpatched Struts version allows for OGNL expression evaluation through user-supplied parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary Java code execution on the server, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted HTTP requests with malicious OGNL expressions in parameters like `productId` and `search`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
2.  **Manipulation of Product Prices:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation when calculating total costs, allowing for negative quantities.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper server-side validation for product quantities.
    *   **Impact:**  Attackers can purchase products at significantly reduced prices by using negative quantities, particularly damaging for shops selling digital products.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `productQuantity` parameter in AJAX DWR requests or through a crafted request to `addToCart` when a "standalone shopping cart" is used.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to intercept and modify web requests
3.  **Manipulation of Customer Data / Mass Assignment:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application improperly allows modification of customer data through the `customerId` parameter during user registration or address change. It allows the modification of other user accounts through the `customer.customerPassword` parameter.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper access controls and parameter validation.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover through password changes or overwriting user data, including sensitive information.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Including the `customerId` and `customer.customerPassword` parameters in HTTP requests to `/shop/profile/register.action` and `/shop/profile/changeAddress.action` or by modifying the customer details page in the admin interface.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send HTTP requests.
4.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of CSRF protection in critical administrative actions.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Missing anti-CSRF tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can manipulate product prices, customer data, and even overwrite customer passwords by tricking logged-in administrators to perform malicious actions via crafted requests.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Tricking a logged-in admin into visiting a webpage that triggers a CSRF request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to trick a user (e.g. an admin) to click a malicious link while logged in
5.  **Missing Anti Brute Force Protection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of protection against brute-force login attempts.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Absence of login attempt throttling and weak password policy enforcement.
    *   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to password guessing attacks
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Repeated login attempts with different credentials
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send login requests repeatedly.
6.  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper input sanitization in the administration interface.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious JavaScript execution in the context of the administrator's browser, potentially leading to account compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript in parameters like `customername` and `productname`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft URLs with javascript.

The advisory notes that version 2 of the software was released, but that it was not tested by SEC Consult. Workarounds include updating the Apache Struts library, disallowing negative product quantities and identifying customers by session rather than customer ID.
