Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-4133:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption vulnerability due to incorrect memory access within Internet Explorer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Web-based attacks:  An attacker could host a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability.
    *   Compromised websites: Attackers could inject malicious content into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content or advertisements.
    *   Social Engineering: Attackers would need to convince users to visit the malicious website through phishing emails, instant messages, or by enticing them to open attachments.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website.
    *   The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website while using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Affected Software:**

*   Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 on Windows clients and servers are affected. Specifically:
    *   Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2
    *   Windows Vista Service Pack 2
    *   Windows Server 2008 Service Pack 2
    *   Windows 7 Service Pack 1
    *   Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1
*  It is noted that the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.

**Mitigation:**

*   Enhanced Security Configuration in Internet Explorer on Windows servers reduces the likelihood of exploitation from untrusted sites.
*   Using EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can help mitigate attacks.
*   Configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones can help as a workaround.
*   Setting Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones can act as a workaround.

**Other Information:**

*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was issued.
*   There were no reports of this vulnerability being actively exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS14-056) that details a cumulative security update for Internet Explorer. It addresses 14 privately reported vulnerabilities, with the most severe being remote code execution.
*   The update modifies how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory and adds permission validations.
*   The bulletin also includes information on other vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-4123, CVE-2014-4124, CVE-2014-4140, etc.) that are not related to CVE-2014-4133, and details mitigation and workarounds.

This information is consistent with a typical memory corruption vulnerability that allows for remote code execution when a user visits a specially crafted webpage.
