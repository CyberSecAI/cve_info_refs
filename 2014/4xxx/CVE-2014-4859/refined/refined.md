The provided content is related to CVE-2014-4859.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow during the parsing of a capsule image in the UEFI boot process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to an integer overflow that causes a buffer to be allocated with an unexpectedly small size. This can be triggered during the Drive Execution Environment (DXE) phase of the UEFI boot process.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can write attacker-controlled data past the bounds of the undersized buffer leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of system firmware. This could allow for persistent firmware-level rootkits, bypassing of Secure Boot, or a denial-of-service of the platform.

**Attack vectors:** Local, authenticated access is required. The attack occurs during the DXE phase of the UEFI boot process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local authenticated attacker with driver-level access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
