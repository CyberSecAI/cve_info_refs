- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null dereference existed in the handling of ASN.1 data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Processing of maliciously crafted ASN.1 data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply specially crafted ASN.1 data to the vulnerable component.
