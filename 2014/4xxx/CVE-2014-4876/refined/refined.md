- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending a specific string to TCP port 54138 triggers the system to return environment variables and other information. This behavior is intentional for support purposes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Exposure (CWE-200). The system discloses potentially sensitive information to unauthenticated clients.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can obtain system environment variables, directory listings, and enhanced mode log files.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a special string to TCP port 54138.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable system. They do not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
