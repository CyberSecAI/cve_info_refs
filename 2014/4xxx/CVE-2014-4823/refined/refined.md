Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4823:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a command injection flaw and a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile and IBM Security Access Manager for Web.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands that the server will then execute.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This enables an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Command Injection:** A successful command injection can lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code, modify data, or cause denial of service.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting:** A successful XSS attack can allow an attacker to steal sensitive information, such as cookies, hijack user sessions, deface websites, or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vectors are not detailed in this document but would involve injecting malicious code via input fields, parameters, or other means that the application does not properly sanitize.
*   The command injection vulnerability would involve exploiting how the application interacts with the operating system shell.
* The XSS vulnerability would exploit how the application handles user-supplied data in the context of generating web pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input to the vulnerable applications. This could potentially occur from a remote location.
*   For XSS, the attacker might need to convince a user to visit a malicious URL or interact with injected content.
*  For Command injection, the attacker would need to be able to trigger a code execution flow where user-supplied data is used unsafely by the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Security Access Manager for Mobile and Web.
*   IBM has released patches to fix the vulnerability.
*   The IBM bulletin mentions two vulnerabilities: CVE-2014-4823 and CVE-2014-6079, but the content focuses on the vulnerabilities relating to CVE-2014-4823.

This analysis provides more specific details than the placeholder CVE description, clarifying the nature of the vulnerability, affected products, and potential impacts.
