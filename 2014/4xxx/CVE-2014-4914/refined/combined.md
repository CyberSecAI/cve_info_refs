How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# ZF2014-04: Potential SQL injection in the ORDER implementation of Zend\_Db\_Select

The implementation of the `ORDER BY` SQL statement in `Zend_Db_Select` of Zend
Framework 1 contains a potential SQL injection when the query string passed
contains parentheses.

For instance, the following code is affected by this issue:

```
$db     = Zend_Db::factory( /* options here */ );
$select = $db->select()
    ->from(array('p' => 'products'))
    ->order('MD5(1); drop table products');
echo $select;

```

This code produce the string:

```
SELECT "p".* FROM "products" AS "p" ORDER BY MD5(1);drop table products ASC

```

instead of the correct one:

```
SELECT "p".* FROM "products" AS "p" ORDER BY "MD5(1);drop table products" ASC

```

The SQL injection occurs because we create a new `Zend_Db_Expr()` object, in
presence of parentheses, passing directly the value without any filter on the
string.

## Action Taken

We fixed the issue in the `Zend_Db_Select::order()` function using a more
granular regular expression to match only SQL functions in an `ORDER BY`
statement, such as `ORDER BY ABS("zfproducts"."product_id")`.

The new regular expression is `'/^[\w]*\(.*\)$/'` instead of the previous
`'/\(.*\)/'`. This change fixes the issue, filtering the input using quotes for
the previous attack.

The previous SQL example with the fix is rendered in the correct way:

```
SELECT "p".* FROM "products" AS "p" ORDER BY "MD5(1);drop table products" ASC

```

**The patch is available starting in Zend Framework 1.12.7.**

## Other Information

This SQL injection attack does not affect Zend Framework 2 versions because the
implementation of `Zend\Db\Sql\Select::order()` does not manage parenthetical
expressions.

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and
working with us to help protect its users:

* Cassiano Dal Pizzol, who discovered the original issue;
* Lars Kneschke, who analyzed and reported the issue;
* Enrico Zimuel, who provided the patch.

## JPCERT/CC Addendum

This JVN publication was delayed to 2015/12/11 after the developer fix was developed. From the fiscal year 2011, JPCERT/CC is using a new vendor coordination procedure. This new procedure came from the recommendation of the fiscal year 2010 "Study Group on Information System Vulnerability Handling" aimed at more timely JVN publications.

Debian Bug     : 743175 754201

in the version initially shipped with Jessie.

CVE-2014-2681

    Entity injection attacks in some functions. This fix extends the
    incomplete one from CVE-2012-5657.

CVE-2014-2682

    Lukas Reschke reported a failure to consider that the
    libxml_disable_entity_loader setting is shared among threads in the
    PHP-FPM case. This fix extends the incomplete one from
    CVE-2012-5657.

CVE-2014-2683

    Lukas Reschke reported a lack of protection against XML Entity
    Expansion attacks in some functions. This fix extends the incomplete
    one from CVE-2012-6532.

CVE-2014-2684

    Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov from the Ruhr-University
    Bochum reported an error in the consumer's verify method that lead
    to acceptance of wrongly sourced tokens.

CVE-2014-2685

    Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov from the Ruhr-University
    Bochum reported a specification violation in which signing of a
    single parameter is incorrectly considered sufficient.

CVE-2014-4914

    Cassiano Dal Pizzol discovered that the implementation of the ORDER
    BY SQL statement in Zend_Db_Select contains a potential SQL
    injection when the query string passed contains parentheses.

CVE-2014-8088

    Yury Dyachenko at Positive Research Center identified potential XML
    eXternal Entity injection vectors due to insecure usage of PHP's DOM
    extension.

CVE-2014-8089

    Jonas SandstrÃ¶m discovered an SQL injection vector when manually
    quoting value for sqlsrv extension, using null byte.

CVE-2015-3154

    Filippo Tessarotto and Maks3w reported potential CRLF injection
    attacks in mail and HTTP headers.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.11.13-1.1+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.9+dfsg-2+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
in version 1.12.12+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.12+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.
