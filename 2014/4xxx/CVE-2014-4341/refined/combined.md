## Description

```
MIT Kerberos 5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a buffer
over-read or NULL pointer dereference, by injecting invalid tokens into a
GSSAPI application session (CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342).

MIT Kerberos 5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a
double-free flaw or NULL pointer dereference, while processing invalid
SPNEGO tokens (CVE-2014-4343, CVE-2014-4344).

In MIT Kerberos 5, when kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDC
database, an authenticated remote attacker can cause it to perform an
out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow) (CVE-2014-4345).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-07-04 01:54:50 UTC  ``` Flaws were found in the way MIT Kerberos handled RFC 1964 tokens. A man-in-the-middle attacker able to inject packets into an application's GSS-API session could use this flaw to crash the application.  References:  <http://diswww.mit.edu:8008/menelaus.mit.edu/cvs-krb5/28388> <https://github.com/krb5/krb5/commit/fb99962cbd063ac04c9a9d2cc7c75eab73f3533d>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-07-04 01:57:00 UTC  ```  Created krb5 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1116181](show_bug.cgi?id=1116181 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-4342 CVE-2014-4341 krb5: denial of service flaws when handling RFC 1964 tokens [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-07-17 08:28:32 UTC  ``` There are two distinct flaws in krb5:  CVE-2014-4341: Affects all shipped versions of krb5 package. CVE-2014-4342: Affects only krb5-1.7 and later.  Hence it makes more sense to split this bug into two parts.  We will use this flaw for [CVE-2014-4341](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4341).  In MIT krb5, an unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when attempting to read beyond the end of a buffer.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-07-17 08:36:07 UTC  ``` [CVE-2014-4342](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4342) is now filed as [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1120581](show_bug.cgi?id=1120581 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-4342 krb5: denial of service flaws when handling RFC 1964 tokens")   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c8)  Siddharth Sharma    2014-07-17 09:40:28 UTC  ```  A remote unauthenticated attacker is able to send a specially crafted packet to crash a Kerberos server. The kg_unseal_v1 and kg_unseal_v1_iov functions in GSSAPI are reachable externally and do not handle issues like checking for header length less than 22 bytes, shorter ciphertext than the confounder and declared padding length longer than the plaintext.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c9)  Siddharth Sharma    2014-07-17 10:20:48 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c11)  Fedora Update System    2014-08-07 15:27:04 UTC  ``` krb5-1.11.3-24.fc19 has been pushed to the Fedora 19 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c12)  Fedora Update System    2014-08-07 15:32:43 UTC  ``` krb5-1.11.5-10.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1116180#c13)  Martin Prpič    2014-09-09 09:47:21 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos handled certain requests.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109919#c0)  Nalin Dahyabhai    2014-06-16 15:45:28 UTC  ``` Description of problem: We'd like for Kerberos clients to be able to access KDCs and password changing services over https proxies, via the [MS-KKDCP] support that's planned for krb5 1.13.  If we don't end up jumping to that in the next update, we're going to want to backport it.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): krb5-1.11.3-49.el7  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Stand up a Windows Server with the KDC Proxy Service running, or a web server with python kdcproxy. 2. Configure /etc/krb5.conf with 'kdc' and 'kpasswd_server' entries only in the form of https URLs and with the server's CA as a trusted anchor, either in the default locations or via explicit configuration. 3. Attempt each of 'kinit' (AS request), 'kvno' (TGS request), and 'kpasswd' (kpasswd request).  Actual results: Each fails because the library doesn't know how to even parse HTTPS URLs, much less use them.  Expected results: Each should succeed.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1109919#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-03-05 10:00:56 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Handle invalid RFC 1964 tokens [[CVE-2014-4341](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qq5g-rggx-4f8p "CVE-2014-4341")...]

```
Detect the following cases which would otherwise cause invalid memory
accesses and/or integer underflow:

* An RFC 1964 token being processed by an RFC 4121-only context
  [[CVE-2014-4342](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-734c-f6jq-56f9 "CVE-2014-4342")]

* A header with fewer than 22 bytes after the token ID or an
  incomplete checksum [[CVE-2014-4341](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qq5g-rggx-4f8p "CVE-2014-4341") [CVE-2014-4342](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-734c-f6jq-56f9 "CVE-2014-4342")]

* A ciphertext shorter than the confounder [[CVE-2014-4341](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qq5g-rggx-4f8p "CVE-2014-4341")]

* A declared padding length longer than the plaintext [[CVE-2014-4341](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qq5g-rggx-4f8p "CVE-2014-4341")]

If we detect a bad pad byte, continue on to compute the checksum to
avoid creating a padding oracle, but treat the checksum as invalid
even if it compares equal.

[CVE-2014-4341](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qq5g-rggx-4f8p "CVE-2014-4341"):

In MIT krb5, an unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to
inject packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application
session can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references
when attempting to read beyond the end of a buffer.

    CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C

[CVE-2014-4342](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-734c-f6jq-56f9 "CVE-2014-4342"):

In MIT krb5 releases krb5-1.7 and later, an unauthenticated remote
attacker with the ability to inject packets into a legitimately
established GSSAPI application session can cause a program crash due
to invalid memory references when reading beyond the end of a buffer
or by causing a null pointer dereference.

    CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C

## Topic

Updated krb5 packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and add
various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the CVE
links in the References section.

Kerberos is a networked authentication system which allows clients and servers
to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third party, the
Kerberos KDC.

## Description

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO acceptor
for continuation tokens. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw
to crash a GSSAPI-enabled server application. (CVE-2014-4344)

A buffer overflow was found in the KADM5 administration server (kadmind) when it
was used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database. A remote, authenticated
attacker could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the system
running kadmind. (CVE-2014-4345)

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos libgssapi\_krb5
library processed valid context deletion tokens. An attacker able to make an
application using the GSS-API library (libgssapi) call the
gss\_process\_context\_token() function could use this flaw to crash that
application. (CVE-2014-5352)

If kadmind were used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database, a remote,
authenticated attacker with the permissions to set the password policy could
crash kadmind by attempting to use a named ticket policy object as a password
policy for a principal. (CVE-2014-5353)

A double-free flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos handled invalid External
Data Representation (XDR) data. An authenticated user could use this flaw to
crash the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind), or other applications
using Kerberos libraries, using specially crafted XDR packets. (CVE-2014-9421)

It was found that the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind) incorrectly
accepted certain authentication requests for two-component server principal
names. A remote attacker able to acquire a key with a particularly named
principal (such as "kad/x") could use this flaw to impersonate any user to
kadmind, and perform administrative actions as that user. (CVE-2014-9422)

An information disclosure flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos RPCSEC\_GSS
implementation (libgssrpc) handled certain requests. An attacker could send a
specially crafted request to an application using libgssrpc to disclose a
limited portion of uninitialized memory used by that application.
(CVE-2014-9423)

Two buffer over-read flaws were found in the way MIT Kerberos handled certain
requests. A remote, unauthenticated attacker able to inject packets into a
client or server application's GSSAPI session could use either of these flaws to
crash the application. (CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342)

A double-free flaw was found in the MIT Kerberos SPNEGO initiators. An attacker
able to spoof packets to appear as though they are from an GSSAPI acceptor could
use this flaw to crash a client application that uses MIT Kerberos.
(CVE-2014-4343)

Red Hat would like to thank the MIT Kerberos project for reporting the
CVE-2014-5352, CVE-2014-9421, CVE-2014-9422, and CVE-2014-9423 issues. MIT
Kerberos project acknowledges Nico Williams for helping with the analysis of
CVE-2014-5352.

The krb5 packages have been upgraded to upstream version 1.12, which provides a
number of bug fixes and enhancements, including:

* Added plug-in interfaces for principal-to-username mapping and verifying

authorization to user accounts.

* When communicating with a KDC over a connected TCP or HTTPS socket, the client

gives the KDC more time to reply before it transmits the request to another
server. (BZ#1049709, BZ#1127995)

This update also fixes multiple bugs, for example:

* The Kerberos client library did not recognize certain exit statuses that the

resolver libraries could return when looking up the addresses of servers
configured in the /etc/krb5.conf file or locating Kerberos servers using DNS
service location. The library could treat non-fatal return codes as fatal
errors. Now, the library interprets the specific return codes correctly.
(BZ#1084068, BZ#1109102)

In addition, this update adds various enhancements. Among others:

* Added support for contacting KDCs and kpasswd servers through HTTPS proxies

implementing the Kerberos KDC Proxy (KKDCP) protocol. (BZ#1109919)

## Solution

All krb5 users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
these issues and add these enhancements.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata relevant
to your system have been applied.

Debian Bug     : 753624 753625 755520 755521 757416

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2014-4341

    An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject
    packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session
    can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when
    attempting to read beyond the end of a buffer.

CVE-2014-4342

    An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject
    packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session
    can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when
    reading beyond the end of a buffer or by causing a null pointer
    dereference.

CVE-2014-4343

    An unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to spoof packets
    appearing to be from a GSSAPI acceptor can cause a double-free
    condition in GSSAPI initiators (clients) which are using the SPNEGO
    mechanism, by returning a different underlying mechanism than was
    proposed by the initiator. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw
    to cause an application crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2014-4344

    An unauthenticated or partially authenticated remote attacker can
    cause a NULL dereference and application crash during a SPNEGO
    negotiation by sending an empty token as the second or later context
    token from initiator to acceptor.

CVE-2014-4345

    When kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDC database, an
    authenticated remote attacker can cause it to perform an
    out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow).

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-7.

We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
