Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-4345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `kadmind` daemon of MIT Kerberos 5 when configured with an LDAP backend for the KDC database. This overflow is triggered by an off-by-one error during the copying of key information to a new database entry when using the `-keepold` option with the `cpw` (change password) command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** An off-by-one error in the code handling key information during a `cpw -keepold` operation leads to data being written past the boundaries of an allocated buffer.
*   **Improper bounds checking**: The code does not correctly calculate and check the boundaries of the array when storing multiple keys of the same kvno, resulting in the out of bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote, authenticated attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable `kadmind` service due to the buffer overflow.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The buffer overflow could also lead to a segmentation fault or application crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability over the network.
*   **Authenticated:** The attacker must have valid Kerberos credentials and be authenticated to the `kadmind` service.
*   **Specific Configuration:** The `kadmind` service must be configured to use an LDAP backend for the KDC database, which is a non-default configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs valid credentials to access `kadmind` service.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable `kadmind` service.
*   **Specific `kadmind` Configuration:** The attacker requires the target system to have `kadmind` configured to use LDAP as the KDC database backend.
*   **Knowledge of `cpw -keepold` behavior:** To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must use the `cpw -keepold` command, repeatedly.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is not related to the Kerberos protocol itself but to the implementation in the `kadmind` service.
*   The issue was fixed in MIT Kerberos 5 versions 1.12.2 and 1.11.6 and later versions.
*   The bug can lead to an out-of-bounds write in the `ldap_principal2.c` file within the `krb5_encode_krbsecretkey` function.
*   Red Hat has classified this vulnerability as having a Moderate security impact, while GitHub classified it as High.
*   Some vendors addressed this issue by backporting the fix to their versions of Kerberos.
*  The vulnerability can be exploited by performing multiple cpw -keepold operations.
*   The vulnerability may have different impacts depending on specific product, version, and architecture.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Buffer overflow in Kerberos `kadmind` when configured with LDAP.
*   **Cause:**  Off-by-one error in `ldap_principal2.c` during key information processing of `cpw -keepold` operations.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution or DoS.
*   **Vector:** Network, authenticated access, specific configuration with LDAP backend for kadmind.
*   **Fix:**  Patches are available for Kerberos 5 versions 1.12.2 and 1.11.6 (and later versions), and has been backported in some other distros.
