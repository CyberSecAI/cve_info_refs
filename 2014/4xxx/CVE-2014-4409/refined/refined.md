Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-4409:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how WebKit handles the HTML5 application cache. Specifically, web applications could store data in the cache during normal browsing and then access that data while in private browsing mode, which is intended to provide user privacy by not retaining data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Isolation:**  Private browsing mode failed to provide a truly isolated environment for application cache data.
*   **Information Leakage:** Private browsing mode was not adequately protected against data sharing across browsing contexts.
*   **Data Persistence:** Cache data persisted even when private browsing mode was enabled which was not expected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Tracking:** A malicious website could track users even when they are using private browsing. This undermines user privacy and can be used for malicious purposes like targeted advertisement, etc.
*   **Privacy Violation:** User's browsing behavior which was supposed to be private can be recorded through the cache.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Websites:** Attackers need to host a website with embedded code that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** Users are required to visit this malicious website and interact with it in both normal and private browsing modes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server:** The attacker needs to control a web server to host the malicious website.
*   **No Special Network Position**: The attack does not require a privileged network position.
*   **Target Awareness**: Attackers must be aware of the issue to target users specifically.

**Additional Details from the provided information:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affected Safari versions prior to 6.2 and 7.1, as well as iOS 8 for iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch 5th generation and later, iPad 2 and later
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed by disabling access to the application cache when in private browsing mode.
*   **Reporting:** The vulnerability was reported by Yosuke Hasegawa of NetAgent Co., Ltd.
*   **CWE Mapping:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-DesignError by JVN.
