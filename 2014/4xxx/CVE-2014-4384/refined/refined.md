- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A path traversal issue existed in App Installation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability that allowed code signature validation to be redirected to a different bundle during app installation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker could potentially install unverified applications by exploiting the path traversal issue and bypassing code signature checks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, where an attacker can manipulate the installation process on the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker with the ability to interact with the device's file system and install applications.
