  "Root cause": "A user-space buffer overflow existed in the shader compiler.",

    "User-space buffer overflow"
  ],
  "Impact": "Compiling untrusted GLSL shaders may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Compiling untrusted GLSL shaders",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to compile untrusted GLSL shaders."
