Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-4346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Cookie Disclosure:** The Apache `g_soap` module's error handler prints all request header information, including the HTTP Cookie field.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple parameters in the Citrix NetScaler are not properly sanitized, making them vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The disclosure of the HTTP Cookie header, specifically the "SESSID" cookie, in error responses.
*   **Reflected XSS:**  Lack of proper input sanitization allows the injection of malicious scripts through various parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Disclosure:** Attackers can use XSS to steal the "SESSID" cookie, which is typically marked as `HttpOnly` to prevent client-side script access.
*   **XSS:** Attackers can steal user information, impersonate users, and perform administrative actions on the NetScaler appliance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The cookie disclosure vulnerability can be triggered by a simple GET request to the `/soap` endpoint.
*   **Malicious URLs:** Reflected XSS is exploited by crafting URLs with injected JavaScript code in vulnerable parameters (e.g., `/menu/topn?name=`, `/pcidss/launch_report?type=`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Citrix NetScaler.
*   **User Interaction (for XSS):** For XSS attacks, a user must be tricked into clicking a malicious link or accessing a compromised page with the crafted URL.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must be aware of the specific parameters that are vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that even if the injected script is not executed directly (e.g., in a Java JNLP context), attackers can still inject arguments which may lead to further attacks.
*   The vulnerability was found by Stefan Viehb√∂ck of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab.
*   The advisory provides proof-of-concept examples for both cookie disclosure and reflected XSS.
*   The vulnerability affects Citrix NetScaler Application Delivery Controller and Citrix NetScaler Gateway versions before 9.3-62.4 and 10.1-126.12.
*   The recommended solution is to update to a more recent version of Citrix NetScaler.
