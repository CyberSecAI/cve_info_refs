  "CVE-2014-4049": {
    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the way PHP parsed DNS responses. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could use these flaws to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a PHP application that uses the dns_get_record() function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow in DNS TXT record parsing within PHP's `dns_get_record()` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the PHP application.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to manipulate DNS responses sent to a vulnerable PHP application."
