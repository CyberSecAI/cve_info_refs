Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-4707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient security checks within the BootRom and Boot Menu functionalities of Huawei Campus S7700/S9300/S9700 switches. This allows unauthorized actions, such as:

*   Bypassing security checks during boot processes.
*   Unauthorized modification of critical system software components (bootrom, bootload, FPGA/CPLD).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The document identifies four specific vulnerabilities:

1.  **HWPSIRT-2014-0315:** Unauthorized users can upgrade the bootrom or bootloader software.
2.  **HWPSIRT-2014-0316:** The BootRom menu allows unauthorized users to bypass system security checks.
3.  **HWPSIRT-2014-0317:** The Boot Menu allows unauthorized users to compromise the switch.
4.  **HWPSIRT-2014-0318:** The Boot Menu allows users to upgrade the small BootRom/main BootRom or FPGA/CPLD software and bypass the system security check mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can gain control over the affected switch.
*   Attackers can potentially compromise the switch by modifying or replacing critical software components.
*   Bypassing security checks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the console or out-of-band management port of the switch. Attackers need physical or network access.
*   For HWPSIRT-2014-0318, the attacker also needs to know the password for the Boot Menu.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical or Network Access:** Attackers require access to the console or out-of-band management port of the switch to interact with the BootRom or Boot Menu.
*   **Boot Menu Password:**  For HWPSIRT-2014-0318, the attacker requires the password of the Boot Menu, in addition to the above.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document provides CVSSv2 scores for each of the four vulnerabilities along with temporal scores.
*   Affected products are Huawei S7700, S9300 and S9700 series switches with specific software versions mentioned in the table.
*   Fixes are available via software upgrades.
*   The document mentions that Huawei is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability at the time of release.
