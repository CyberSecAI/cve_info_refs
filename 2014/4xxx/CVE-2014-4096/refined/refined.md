Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-4096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper handling leads to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: The core issue is a memory corruption flaw triggered by incorrect object access within Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, leading to privilege escalation and complete system compromise.
- Data manipulation and account control: An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based Attacks: An attacker could host a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability when a user visits it via Internet Explorer.
- Compromised Websites: Attackers can also inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content.
- Social Engineering: The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website or open a malicious attachment to initiate the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject malicious web content: Attackers need to control or influence content accessible via Internet Explorer.
- User interaction: The attacker must convince a user to interact with the malicious content (e.g., clicking a link or opening a file).

**Additional Information:**
- This CVE is one of many memory corruption vulnerabilities patched in the same update.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 11 on Windows clients (Critical) and servers (Moderate).
- The security update modifies how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory to prevent the corruption.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
- Mitigation exists through Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Servers, and EMET can provide additional mitigation if configured.
- Workarounds include prompting before running Active Scripting or disabling it, and setting security zone settings to "High" in Internet Explorer.
