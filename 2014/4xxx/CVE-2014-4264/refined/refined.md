Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-4264:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from "incorrect TLS/EC management" within the OpenJDK Security component. This indicates an issue in how the Java implementation handles data related to Transport Layer Security (TLS) and elliptic curve cryptography (EC).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect handling of TLS and elliptic curve data:** The core problem lies in the improper management of data specifically related to TLS and elliptic curve cryptography. The precise nature of the incorrect handling isn't detailed, but it's enough to create a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Impact on availability of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM):** The primary impact of a successful exploit is that it could disrupt the availability of the Java Virtual Machine. This means an attacker could potentially cause the JVM to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated remote attacker:** An unauthenticated attacker, meaning they do not need prior access to the system, can exploit this vulnerability remotely. This suggests that the vulnerability is exposed over a network and can be triggered remotely without requiring any specific user credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote network access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the vulnerable JVM instance over a network.
*   **Ability to send malicious data:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send data that triggers the vulnerability related to the incorrect TLS/EC management within the targeted JVM.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Elliptic Curve (EC) cryptography in OpenJDK**:  The issue specifically affects the Elliptic Curve cryptography implementation in OpenJDK. However, the advisory notes that the OpenJDK packages shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora do not enable EC support by default, implying they were not affected unless explicitly configured to use EC.
*   **Fix Availability**: The vulnerability has been addressed in Oracle Java SE 7.0u65 and 8.0u11 and in IcedTea 2.5.1 for OpenJDK 7.
*   **Red Hat Errata:** Red Hat issued RHSA-2014:0902 to address this and other vulnerabilities in Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.
*   **Critical Severity:** Red Hat rated this vulnerability as having a critical security impact.

**In Summary:**

CVE-2014-4264 is a critical remote denial-of-service vulnerability in OpenJDK stemming from incorrect handling of TLS and elliptic curve cryptography data. It can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker to disrupt the availability of a vulnerable Java Virtual Machine. Patches and updates have been released by Oracle and through distributions like Red Hat to address this vulnerability.
