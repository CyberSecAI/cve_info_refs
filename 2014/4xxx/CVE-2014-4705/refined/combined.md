How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Advisory-Heap Overflow Vulnerability in Huawei eSap Platform

* SA No:Huawei-SA-20140616-01-eSap
* Initial Release Date:
  Jun 16, 2014
* Last Release Date:
  Sep 23, 2014

Summary

Huawei eSap software platform has four heap overflow vulnerabilities. Huawei products that have used this platform are affected. When receiving some special malformed packets, such devices access heap memory that is beyond the valid range and cause unexpected restart of the devices. If an attacker keeps sending such malformed packets, the devices will repeatedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) attack (Vulnerability ID: HWPSIRT-2014-0111).

This Vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID: CVE-2014-4705.

Huawei has provided fixed versions.

| WLAN ACU2 | V200R005C00SPC100 |

Impact

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can cause a DoS attack.

Vulnerability Scoring Details

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSSv2 scoring system ([http://www.first.org/cvss/](http://)).

Base Score: 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)

Temporal Score: 6.4 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C)

Technique Details

1. Prerequisite:

The attacker can remotely access the target devices.

2. Attacking procedure:

An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by remotely sending a special malformed packet. The validity of some length fields in the malformed packets is not checked. As a result, the devices receiving such malformed packets copy too much data into the heap memory and overwrite some other useful data, causing unexpected system restart.

Temporary Fix

None
