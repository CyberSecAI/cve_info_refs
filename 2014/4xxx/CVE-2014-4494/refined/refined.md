- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An issue existed in determining when to prompt for trust when first opening an enterprise-signed application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper code signature validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Enterprise-signed applications could be launched without prompting for user trust, potentially leading to the execution of malicious apps without the user's explicit consent.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious enterprise-signed application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to distribute a malicious application signed with an enterprise certificate.
