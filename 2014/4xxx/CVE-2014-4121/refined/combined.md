## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3000414)

Published: October 14, 2014 | Updated: December 10, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sends a specially crafted URI request containing international characters to a .NET web application. In .NET 4.0 and below applications, the vulnerable functionality (iriParsing) is disabled by default; for the vulnerability to be exploitable an application has to explicitly enable this functionality. In .NET 4.5 applications, iriParsing is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, Microsoft .NET Framework 4, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5/4.5.1/4.5.2 on affected releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by improving how Microsoft .NET Framework communicates with the ClickOnce installer process, by correcting how it handles specially crafted requests, and by helping to ensure that affected versions of Microsoft .NET Framework properly implement the ASLR security feature. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table later in this bulletin.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

[1]**.NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile affected.** The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of .NET Framework 4. The vulnerability addressed in this update affects both .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Installing the .NET Framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5a4x27ek).

[2]This update is available via [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

## Update FAQ

**How do I determine which version of Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912).

**What are the best practices for communication between .NET service endpoints?**

MicrosoftÃ¢ÂÂs stated best practices recommend that .NET-managed applications use the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) to send data as asynchronous messages from one service endpoint to another. WCF includes significant feature, performance, and security improvements and we strongly recommend that customers use the WCF framework when building service-oriented applications. We also recommend updating existing .NET-managed applications using older IPC technologies, such as DCOM or Remoting, to make use of WCF.

For additional guidance about WCF, please see the following resources:

* [What Is Windows Communication Foundation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms731082%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx)
* [WCF Feature Details](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms733103%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx)
* [Data Transfer and Serialization](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms733103%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx)
* [DCOM to WCF Migration Guidance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn762115%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx)

**There are multiple update packages available for some of the affected software. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for a given system can be applied in any sequence.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In .NET 4.0 and below applications, iriParsing is disabled by default; for the vulnerability to be exploitable, an application has to explicitly enable this functionality by setting <iriParsing enabled="true"/> in the app.config file. For more information, see [<iriParsing> Element (Uri Settings)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb882600%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx). In .NET 4.5 applications, iriParsing is enabled by default and cannot be disabled. For more information, see [Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework 4.5](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh367887%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx).

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable iriParsing for .NET 4.0 and below applications**

  For .NET 4.0 and below applications, set iriParsing to Ã¢ÂÂfalseÃ¢ÂÂ. For more information, see [<iriParsing> Element (Uri Settings)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb882600%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx).

  **Note**Â For .NET 4.5 applications, this option cannot be disabled. For more information, see [Application Compatibility in the .NET Framework 4.5](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh367887%28v%3Dvs.110%29.aspx).

  **Impact of workaround.**Â System.Uri will be unable to properly parse internationalized resource identifiers.

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## .NET ASLR Vulnerability - CVE-2014-4122

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Microsoft .NET Framework that could allow an attacker to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-4122](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4122).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Install the Force ASLR feature hotfix and enable the IFEO registry entry**

  The Force ASLR feature, which is an addition to the ASLR feature for Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, makes it possible for applications to forcibly relocate images that are not built with the /DYNAMICBASE linker flag. Once installed, computer administrators and software developers can enable the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) in the registry to force ASLR behavior for non-ASLR images.

  For more information and installation instructions, seeÂ [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639308](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639308).

  **Impact of workaround.**Â Forcibly relocates images that are not built with support for ASLR, which can cause application compatibility problems.

  How to undo the workaround.

  **Note** SeeÂ [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2639308](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2639308)Â for information on setting the IFEO registry entry to the default setting.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a security feature bypass vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework does not use the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack.

**What is ASLR?**

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) moves executable images into random locations when a system boots, which helps prevent an attacker from leveraging data at predictable locations. For a component to support ASLR, all components that it loads must also support ASLR. For example, if A.exe consumes B.dll and C.dll, all three must support ASLR. By default, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 will randomize system DLLs and EXEs, but DLLs and EXEs created by Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) must opt in to support ASLR using the /DYNAMICBASE linker option.

**ASLR also randomizes heap and stack memory:**

* When an application creates a heap in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2, the heap manager will create that heap at a random location to help reduce the chance that an attempt to exploit a heap-based buffer overrun succeeds. Heap randomization is enabled by default for all applications running on Windows Vista and later.
* When a thread starts in a process linked with /DYNAMICBASE, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows RT, Windows RT 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 move the thread's stack to a random location to help reduce the chance that a stack-based buffer overrun exploit will succeed.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the ASLR security feature. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action. For example, an attacker could trick users into clicking a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

When a user visits a website that contains malicious content using a web browser capable of instantiating COM components, such as Internet Explorer, the affected .NET Framework component can be loaded to bypass ASLR.

An attacker could tie this security feature bypass vulnerability to an additional vulnerability, usually a remote code execution vulnerability. The additional vulnerability would take advantage of the security feature bypass for exploitation. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

In the web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Microsoft .NET Framework. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate this vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Microsoft Office software.

For more information about EMET, seeÂ [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that affected versions of Microsoft .NET Framework properly implement the ASLR security feature.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.
