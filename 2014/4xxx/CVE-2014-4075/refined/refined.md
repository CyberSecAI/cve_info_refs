Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-4075:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by ASP.NET MVC failing to properly encode input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in ASP.NET MVC.
- Improper encoding of input allows for injection of client-side scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject a client-side script into a user's web browser.
- The script can:
  - Spoof content.
  - Disclose information.
  - Take actions on the site on behalf of the targeted user.
- This could lead to elevation of privilege.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could:
  - Host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to visit it.
  - Take advantage of compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content.
  - Convince users to click a malicious link in an email or instant message, or open a malicious attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host malicious content or inject it into a website.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to interact with the malicious content (e.g., click a link, visit a website).
- The attacker does not have a way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects ASP.NET MVC versions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 5.1
*   The affected component is `System.Web.Mvc.dll`.
*   The update corrects how ASP.NET MVC handles the encoding of input.

**Mitigation and Workarounds:**

*   The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer can prevent this attack for users browsing websites in the Internet Zone (but not Intranet Zone by default).
*   Setting Internet and Local intranet security zones to "High" can block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting, which can reduce the risk, but may also break website functionality.
*   Adding trusted sites to the Internet Explorer Trusted Sites zone can allow them to function normally while still blocking scripts on untrusted sites.
