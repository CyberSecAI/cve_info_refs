Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4556:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `test-plugin.php` file of the "Swipe Hq Checkout for Eshop" WordPress plugin. The `api_url` parameter is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input provided through the `api_url` parameter in the `test-plugin.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the user's account.
    - **Malware distribution:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website or downloading malware to their system.
    - **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance of the website for phishing or other nefarious purposes.
    - **Data theft:** Stealing sensitive information from the website if not protected by HTTPOnly cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `api_url` parameter and convincing a user to click on it or otherwise visiting it.
  - Example: `http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/swipe–hq–checkout–for–eshop/test-plugin.php?api_url=api_url'><script>alert(4)</script>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Ability to craft malicious URL:** An attacker needs to be able to generate a URL containing the malicious payload.
- **Victim interaction:** The victim needs to visit the crafted URL for the JavaScript code to execute. This may involve social engineering techniques.

**Additional Details**
- The plugin has been closed and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin repository.
- The vulnerable version is identified as 3.7, and possibly lower.
- The public disclosure date is May 25, 2014.
