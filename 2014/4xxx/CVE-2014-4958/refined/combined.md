[0 Comments](#disqus_thread)

One of the greatest challenges in building a web application is making sure it is secure. It's an important matter, as malicious attacks can come from various sources and in various forms.

I cannot stress enough the importance of building secure applications. In that respect, we take security very seriously, knowing that the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite is integral for many web applications. We strive to provide controls that offer great performance and appropriate security.

One of the most common kind of malicious attack related to client content is a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Therefore, this sort of attack will be emphasized below.

Although much of the following content is valid in the most general cases, we will center our discussion around the RadEditor control, as it allows rich-text input from users and is easily regarded as a common target for XSS attacks.

## What is XSS?

First, what is an XSS attack? It refers to a class of attacks where malicious client-side script is injected in the web application. Later, this piece of code is rendered and executed on the page that an unsuspecting user has opened. As a result, privacy information may be sent to a location known to the attacker, including personal information or even the authentication cookie resulting in Session theft.

XSS attacks are very common and, at the same time, very dangerous. Furthermore, SSL encryption does not protect from those attacks, which makes preventing them even more important.

## XSS Counter-measures

The RadEditor control has some valuable built-in practices for preventing XSS attacks. Nevertheless, it is always the duty of the developer to implement the necessary content validation, specific to the domain of their application, to protect the integrity of the stored data.

### RadEditor Built-in Counter-Measures

The XSS attack prevention mechanisms of the RadEditor control are based on content filtering. There are two filters specifically dedicated to the task of handling script tags and their content. Those are RemoveScripts and EncodeScripts.

The first filter, RemoveScripts, strips all script tag definitions from the content. It runs both on the client-side and the server-side, because client-side validation can be easily “tricked” and the server-side is the only area that can be fully trusted. Removing the scripts altogether makes sure that no script is executed from the Editor's content, thus no malicious activity can take place.

Nevertheless, there are many cases that need the RadEditor to persist the scripts, but prevent their execution while the content is being edited. For those cases, you should use the EncodeScripts filter that does not remove the scripts, but simply prevents their execution on the client-side.

### CSS Expressions

CSS Expressions were introduced in Internet Explorer 5.5 with the idea to incorporate JavaScript code with CSS properties in an attempt to provide more flexibility. Here is an example:

#container { width: expression((document.body.offsetWidth / 4 + 30) + "px"); }

Unfortunately, this flexibility comes at a price. By using this CSS property, an attacker could inject a piece of malicious script, which may result in a successful XSS attack. We’d like to thank [G.S. McNamara](https://twitter.com/GSMcNamara) from CGI Federal for his research into this attack vector.

RadEditor does not sanitize CSS expressions from the content out of the box at the moment. [Secure input handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_input_and_output_handling) and sanitization has always been an industry best practice, and we want to make sure it is easier for developers to incorporate this extra security measure when it comes to using RadEditor in their apps. As a result, bearing in mind that CSS expressions are considered a [bad practice](https://gtmetrix.com/avoid-css-expressions-pagespeed.html), are [not available in IE8+ versions](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx) of the Internet Explorer browser (unless in compatibility mode) and [IE11 does not support them for the Internet zone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn384050%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx), we see it fit to add an extra layer of built-in sanitizing that strips CSS expressions unconditionally from the Editor content as of Q3 2014. This way, you will get this feature out of the box and you will have one thing less to worry about when it comes to securing from XSS attacks.

As we said, developers should take care of sanitizing the content in their applications from possible threats. That’s why we have come up with a sample implementation for this particular case that can be found in our [feedback portal](http://feedback.telerik.com/Project/108/Feedback/Details/137364-prevent-possible-xss-attack-in-radeditor-using-malicious-content-in-ie).

### Attribute DOM Events

There is another area where the boundaries of presentation and scripting are intertwined—DOM event attributes like onclick, onmouseover, onmousedown, etc. This approach to defining event handlers is very handy and requires minimum code. However it may pose a risk of XSS attacks as malicious script is injected in the attribute definition and later an unsuspecting user is "tricked" into the necessary interaction to trigger the event and the respective malicious code.

For the RadEditor control, we believe in providing enough flexibility when it comes to content management. In that respect, the Editor does not remove event attributes from the content, with the idea that they may be an important part of the intended result. Therefore, it is important for the developer to acknowledge this and if there is a need to strip these attributes, a [custom filter](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/editor/managing-content/content-filters) approach could be used to change the content in the required way.

Securing your web application takes time and effort, but it is worth it. With well implemented security practices and input validation, you can guarantee fewer troubles for your applications. You can be sure that we are there to help you leverage that through our Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX suite.

Be safe and happy coding!

# Disclosing CVE-2014-4958: Stored Attribute-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor Control

Posted on [September 24, 2014](http://maverickblogging.com/disclosing-cve-2014-4958-stored-attribute-based-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability-in-telerik-ui-for-asp-net-ajax-radeditor-control/ "22:57") by [G. S. McNamara](http://maverickblogging.com/author/admin/ "View all posts by G. S. McNamara")

All versions of the popular [UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor Control](http://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx "Telerik site") product by Telerik may be affected by a high-risk stored [attribute-based cross-site scripting](http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2007/07/attribute-based-cross-site-scripting.html) (XSS) vulnerability that is assigned **CVE-2014-4958** by [MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-4958 "MITRE CVEs"), [NVD](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-4958 "NVD"), by OSVDB as [ID 112083](http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/112083 "112083 : UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor Control Editor Window Stored XSS "), and covered [in the news](http://threatpost.com/radeditor-web-editor-vulnerable-to-xss-attacks/108594 "Threatpost: RadEditor Web Editor Vulnerable To XSS Attacks"). This WYSIWYG rich text editor is “…what Microsoft chose to use in MSDN, CodePlex, TechNet, MCMS and even as an alternative to the default editor in SharePoint.”

[![Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor Control](http://maverickblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/RadEditorInterface.png)](http://maverickblogging.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/RadEditorInterface.png)

**Personally tested and confirmed are versions: 2014.1.403.35 (much newer) and 2009.3.1208.20****(much older) using Internet Explorer 8, version 8.0.7601.17514. However, all versions from Telerik at this time may be vulnerable and will continue to be until a patched is released. A workaround may be available.**

What makes this discovery interesting are two parts:

1. **It leverages attribute-based cross-site scripting to exploit the input validation vulnerability.** This achieves the malicious objective without using JavaScript script tags. Instead it uses an inline style attribute of an HTML element.
2. **The RadEditor exchanges the editor window’s mixed content containing elements, attributes, and text with the server in a double URL-encoded hexadecimal value format** detailed below that is translated on the client-side dynamically by Telerik JavaScript into its unencoded form. For example, < first becomes %3C and then finally becomes %253C when the percent sign for the encoded character representation in the first processing round gets encoded again in a second round. This vulnerability is harder to detect than with a typical input vector due to this obfuscated communication protocol. Automated penetration testing tools and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) may miss this, as might manual testers attempting to directly submit through a proxy an attribute-based exploit in its unencoded, or once-encoded form.

Let’s now look at the example payload as it needs to be submitted to the server from a proxy such as PortSwigger’s [Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/) for this to work. Ensure that you place this payload somewhere within the parameter value used for the editor window’s contents:

**%253cdiv STYLE=”background-image: expression(alert(‘XSS’))”%253e%253c%2fdiv%253e**

… which is dynamically translated into the following form after client-side processing by Telerik UI JavaScript:

**<div STYLE=”background-image: expression(alert(‘XSS’))”></div>**

At the time of discovery the only available XSS protection on the server side was to use the [RemoveScripts filter](http://www.telerik.com/help/aspnet-ajax/editor-content-filters.html) to strip out script tags, which is why attribute-based XSS is necessary here.

Carte blanche output encoding will not fix this issue, but instead may actually break the HTML that is rendered in the WYSIWYG editor window if the wrong encoding type is chosen. [Troy Hunt](http://www.troyhunt.com/2010/05/owasp-top-10-for-net-developers-part-2.html) explains the nuance of validating rich text input best by pointing out that markup is being stored in the data layer. Both data and HTML need to be handled by the same input vector here and so looking for script tags is irrelevant in this case because this problem is not that simple. Encoding everything would ensure that user input is displayed only as data and not executed as code by the web browser. However in this case some of the user-supplied content of the rich text editor needs to execute to achieve formatted text.

As an aside, [double encoding](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Double_Encoding) is a type of attack used to bypass security controls. Double encoding may [bypass Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)](http://www.exploit-db.com/papers/17934/).

Previous guidance on the general issue of XSS in the Telerik forums quietly placed the [responsibility of sanitization on developers](http://www.telerik.com/forums/cross-site-scripting-issues-with-the-radeditor-control), but this is likely overlooked in most implementations. Further, the obscure nature of [attribute-based XSS](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/243.html) leveraging an HTML attribute to achieve execution instead of using the popular script tag route makes this harder to filter against. HTML sanitization involves inspection at a deeper level. [Read more about HTML escaping](http://wonko.com/post/html-escaping).

**Remediation:****Telerik states: We have applied a patch to the editor that will be delivered with our Q3 edition of the controls that should be released towards the end of October. A blog post on the issue has been [published here](http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/14-09-24/securing-radeditor-content-and-preventing-xss-attacks).**
