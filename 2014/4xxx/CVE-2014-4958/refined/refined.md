Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor control. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize HTML attributes, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Attribute-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious JavaScript code through HTML attributes, such as the `style` attribute. The injected code is then executed when a user views the content, leading to XSS.
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:**  The RadEditor's built-in XSS protection mechanisms (like `RemoveScripts` which strips `<script>` tags) are insufficient to prevent attribute-based XSS.
*   **Double URL Encoding:** The RadEditor uses double URL encoding to communicate between the client and server. This obfuscates the input, making it harder for automated tools and manual testers to detect XSS exploits. An attacker could submit a payload like `%253cdiv STYLE=”background-image: expression(alert(‘XSS’))”%253e%253c%2fdiv%253e` which will be decoded to `<div STYLE=”background-image: expression(alert(‘XSS’))”></div>` in the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts within the context of a user's browser session.
*   **Information Theft:**  Attackers can steal sensitive information such as session cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Account Compromise:** Attackers could perform actions on behalf of the user if the user is authenticated, by manipulating the application.
*   **Further Attacks:** This vulnerability can be leveraged as a stepping stone for more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input via RadEditor:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML containing attribute-based JavaScript payloads through the RadEditor control. This input is then saved and later rendered in the browser, executing the malicious script.
*   **Double Encoded Payload:** The attacker uses double URL encoding to bypass initial security measures. The injected payload is a style attribute with an `expression()` that executes JavaScript, which bypasses the filter that strips out `<script>` tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to RadEditor:**  The attacker needs access to an application using a vulnerable version of the RadEditor control to inject malicious content.
*   **Knowledge of HTML and JavaScript:** A basic understanding of HTML attributes and JavaScript is needed to craft the XSS payload.
*   **Ability to Intercept and Modify Requests (Optional):** A tool like Burp Suite can be helpful for crafting and submitting the double encoded payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor Control until patched.
*   The vendor was notified and a patch was released in Q3 2014, along with a blog post discussing securing the RadEditor control.
*   The double URL encoding makes the vulnerability harder to detect and highlights the importance of proper input sanitization and output encoding.

**In summary, CVE-2014-4958 is a stored XSS vulnerability caused by insufficient input validation, specifically regarding HTML attributes, in the Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX RadEditor control. An attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's browser through crafted double encoded input. The vulnerability highlights the importance of sanitizing all user-supplied content, even attributes, to prevent XSS attacks.**
