Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-4527:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the `vista-previa-form.php` file of the "EnvíaloSimple: Email Marketing y Newsletters" WordPress plugin.
- The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `FormID` and `AdministratorID` parameters in the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The plugin directly echoes unsanitized user-controlled input into the HTML output. Specifically, the `$_REQUEST['AdministratorID']` and `$_REQUEST['FormID']` parameters are used to construct the URL for the embedded javascript:
  ```html
   <script type='text/javascript' src='http://v2.envialosimple.com/form/show/AdministratorID/<?php echo $administratorID;?>/FormID/<?php echo $formID;?>/format/widget'></script>
  ```
  If the attacker supplies Javascript code through these parameters, it will be included in the page source and executed when a user opens the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
- This could lead to a range of attacks such as:
    - Cookie theft (as demonstrated by the `alert(document.cookie)` PoC).
    - Session hijacking.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `FormID` and `AdministratorID` parameters.
- An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on such a malicious link. This is a typical characteristic of reflected XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute URLs that contain the malicious script in the vulnerable parameters. They then need to social engineer their target into visiting that link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects version 1.97 and likely lower versions of the plugin.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.98, which implemented sanitization for the vulnerable parameters. The changeset link shows that the code was modified to use `intval()` to convert the input parameters to integers.
- The fix uses `intval()` to sanitize the input. This means that only numeric values are accepted, which would prevent the injection of script tags.
- The plugin name is "EnvíaloSimple: Email Marketing y Newsletters" and the plugin directory slug is "envialosimple-email-marketing-y-newsletters-gratis"
