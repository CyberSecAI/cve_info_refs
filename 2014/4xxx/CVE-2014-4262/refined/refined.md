  "CVE-2014-4262": {
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in the AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater class within OpenJDK. It fails to properly check if the field being updated is of a primitive type. This allows an untrusted Java applet or application to potentially trigger memory corruption within the Java Virtual Machine and potentially bypass sandbox restrictions.",
    "affected_components": [
      "OpenJDK",
       "IBM Java Runtime Environment"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Improper type checking within the AtomicReferenceFieldUpdater class when updating fields. Specifically, not verifying if the field being updated is of a primitive type.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Java sandbox bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause memory corruption within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This could also lead to a bypass of the Java sandbox, potentially allowing further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Untrusted Java applications",
      "Untrusted Java applets"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute untrusted Java code, either through an applet or an application.",
    "additional_information": "This issue is mitigated in OpenJDK and Oracle JDK 6 and 7 by a bug that prevents Atomic*FieldUpdater instances when code runs under security manager restrictions. The bug was fixed in JDK8. The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security."
