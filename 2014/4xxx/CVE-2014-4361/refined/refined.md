- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient access control for a private API used to determine the frontmost app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The private API for determining the frontmost app did not have sufficient access control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A background app could determine which app is frontmost.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application running in the background.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A malicious app needs to be installed on the device and be able to run in the background.
