Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   It arises because Microsoft Lync Server fails to properly sanitize specially crafted content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected XSS:** The server echoes unsanitized user-provided data back to the user's browser, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can execute scripts in the user's browser.
*   This could enable them to obtain sensitive information from web sessions, potentially including session cookies, authentication tokens, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Attack:** An attacker sends an email containing a specially crafted URL to a victim. If the victim clicks the link, the XSS payload will be triggered.
*  **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker could host a malicious website, compromise existing websites, or inject the malicious payload into user-provided content that is hosted on a website. They would then need to trick the user into visiting the website containing the malicious link to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the Lync server.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a specially crafted URL (either in an email or a website).
