Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4576:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `diagnostics.php` file of the WordPress Social Login plugin. Specifically, the `xhrurl` parameter is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin does not properly sanitize the `xhrurl` parameter before using it in the application.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's browser. This code could perform actions like:
    *   Stealing cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Modifying content on the page, possibly for phishing attacks or defacement.
    *   Performing actions on the website on behalf of the user.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript in the `xhrurl` parameter.
    *   The attacker can distribute this URL through various means, such as emails, social media, or by embedding it into a website.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking it.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Plugin:** WordPress Social Login
*   **Affected Version:** Versions prior to 2.1.5, specifically mentioned is 2.0.3 and most likely lower.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.1.5 of the plugin.
*   **CVSS Score:** The provided information does not include an official CVSS score for this specific vulnerability, but a similar, fixed XSS vulnerability in a later version is rated as 7.1 (High) , suggesting the severity is significant.

**Technical Details**

* A crafted URL exploiting the vulnerability is provided:
  `http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/wordpressâsocialâlogin/services/diagnostics.php?xhrurl=xhrurl%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&`

This URL demonstrates how the `xhrurl` parameter can be manipulated to inject a basic JavaScript alert.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is an unauthenticated reflected XSS in the WordPress Social Login plugin due to insufficient sanitization of the `xhrurl` parameter in the diagnostics.php file. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser by tricking the user into visiting a crafted URL.
