Does PHP 5 have a better way of doing this?

`filter_var()` and `filter_input()` are the options, but it's more matter of using a standard routine and secure the inputs in a centralized way - e.g. admin UI.

Use the latest files from Github, they contain the most up to date files. You can easily download the zip file using the download button on the right hand side of the main page.

This commit is not included in any release yet as there haven't been any releases since alpha2 which was released very recently.

[@Moc](https://github.com/Moc) I'm developing pyfiscan-tool <https://github.com/fgeek/pyfiscan> to help detect non-updated web software. It would make it lot easier to communicate with end-users when there is actual release. Do you know when alpha3 is out?

[@fgeek](https://github.com/fgeek) the releases are communicated through multiple channels: the github releases page, the news and blog items on the e107 website as well as the social media channels. The alpha3 release will take a while (hopefully in a month, or two). Unless there is a major security issue (this one was quite minor)
