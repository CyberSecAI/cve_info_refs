Does PHP 5 have a better way of doing this?

`filter_var()` and `filter_input()` are the options, but it's more matter of using a standard routine and secure the inputs in a centralized way - e.g. admin UI.

This commit is not included in any release yet as there haven't been any releases since alpha2 which was released very recently.

[@Moc](https://github.com/Moc) I'm developing pyfiscan-tool <https://github.com/fgeek/pyfiscan> to help detect non-updated web software. It would make it lot easier to communicate with end-users when there is actual release. Do you know when alpha3 is out?

[@fgeek](https://github.com/fgeek) the releases are communicated through multiple channels: the github releases page, the news and blog items on the e107 website as well as the social media channels. The alpha3 release will take a while (hopefully in a month, or two). Unless there is a major security issue (this one was quite minor)
