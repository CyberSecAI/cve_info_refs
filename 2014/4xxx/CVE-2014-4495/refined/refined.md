Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-4495:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An issue existed in the kernel shared memory subsystem that allowed an attacker to write to memory that was intended to be read-only.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect permission checks on shared memory regions. Specifically, the kernel was not enforcing read-only restrictions on memory segments, allowing for unauthorized writes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious application could potentially execute arbitrary code with system privileges by writing to restricted kernel memory. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious application running on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system. This could be achieved through a malicious app or by other methods that allow code execution in the userland.

**Affected Products:**
- iOS 8.1.3 (iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch 5th generation and later, iPad 2 and later)
- OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, OS X Yosemite v10.10 and v10.10.1
- Apple TV 3rd generation and later
