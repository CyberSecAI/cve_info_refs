## iOS 8.1

* **Bluetooth**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: A malicious Bluetooth input device may bypass pairing

  Description: Unencrypted connections were permitted from Human Interface Device-class Bluetooth Low Energy accessories. If an iOS device had paired with such an accessory, an attacker could spoof the legitimate accessory to establish a connection. The issue was addressed by denying unencrypted HID connections.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4428 : Mike Ryan of iSEC Partners

* **House Arrest**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Files transferred to the device may be written with insufficient cryptographic protection

  Description: Files could be transferred to an app's Documents directory and encrypted with a key protected only by the hardware UID. This issue was addressed by encrypting the transferred files with a key protected by the hardware UID and the user's passcode.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4448 : Jonathan Zdziarski and Kevin DeLong

* **iCloud Data Access**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position may force iCloud data access clients to leak sensitive information

  Description: A TLS certificate validation vulnerability existed in iCloud data access clients. This issue was addressed by improved certificate validation.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4449 : Carl Mehner of USAA

* **Keyboards**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: QuickType could learn users' credentials

  Description: QuickType could learn users' credentials when switching between elements. This issue was addressed by QuickType not learning from fields where autocomplete is disabled and reapplying the criteria when switching between DOM input elements in legacy WebKit.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4450

* **Secure Transport**

  Available for: iPhone 4s and later, iPod touch (5th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker may be able to decrypt data protected by SSL

  Description: There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL 3.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. An attacker could force the use of SSL 3.0, even when the server would support a better TLS version, by blocking TLS 1.0 and higher connection attempts. This issue was addressed by disabling CBC cipher suites when TLS connection attempts fail.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-3566 : Bodo Moeller, Thai Duong, and Krzysztof Kotowicz of Google Security Team
