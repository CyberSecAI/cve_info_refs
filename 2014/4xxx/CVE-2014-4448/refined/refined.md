- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Files transferred to an app's Documents directory were encrypted with a key protected only by the hardware UID.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient cryptographic protection of transferred files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Files transferred to the device could be accessed or decrypted by an attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: Files transferred to an app's Document directory
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker could potentially gain access to transferred files if they have access to the device or the file system.
