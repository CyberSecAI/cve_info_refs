- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A state management issue existed in the handling of the screen lock.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  A race condition in the Dock could lead to windows remaining visible even when the screen was locked.
- **Impact of exploitation**: In some circumstances, windows may be visible even when the screen is locked, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by a state management issue in the Dock when handling the screen lock.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities or position are mentioned, but it can be inferred that any user able to trigger the screen lock mechanism could potentially exploit this.
