Ansible before 1.5.5 constructs filenames containing user and password
fields on the basis of deb lines in sources.list, which might allow local
users to obtain sensitive credential information in opportunistic
circumstances by leveraging existence of a file that uses the "deb
http://user:pass@server:port/" format.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

It was discovered that Ansible created filenames containing sensitive information.
An attacker could use this vulnerability to obtain unauthorized access to a
private Ubuntu repository.

(Note that 603205 isn't a complete list of the upstream Ansible
vulnerabilities because Mageia is shipping a 1.4.x version and
therefore wasn't interested in
a0e027fe362fbc209dbeff2f72d6e95f39885c69.)

We think 998793fd0ab55705d57527a38cee5e83f535974c is about fixing one
type of issue, but feel free to identify any additional types of
issues that are also fixed. Use CVE-2014-4657 for the general topic of
"the product intentionally allows code execution of code with limited
capabilities, but the code restrictions are insufficient."
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/release1.5.5/CHANGELOG.md>
suggests that this was fixed in 1.5.4.

a0e027fe362fbc209dbeff2f72d6e95f39885c69 seems to be a
straightforward case of "the product creates files that normally
contain secret values, but does not ensure appropriate permissions."
Use CVE-2014-4658.
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/release1.5.5/CHANGELOG.md>
suggests that this was fixed in 1.5.5.

c4b5e46054c74176b2446c82d4df1a2610eddc08 is about multiple types of
issues.
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/release1.5.5/CHANGELOG.md>
suggests that these were fixed in 1.5.5. One issue is doing an
unconditional "chmod 0644" on a file that may have required stronger
permissions for a site-specific reason. Use CVE-2014-4659.

Also, the changes related to _strip_username_password apparently mean
that the product might encounter an /etc/apt/sources.list line
starting with:

  deb http://user:pass@...ver:port/

and would then construct a filename containing the user and pass
fields, leaking credentials in a way that potentially crosses
privilege boundaries. Use CVE-2014-4660.

Does anyone want a CVE ID for this third potential
c4b5e46054c74176b2446c82d4df1a2610eddc08 issue?

The changes related to check_mode apparently mean that
<http://docs.ansible.com/developing_modules.html#check-mode> wasn't
properly implemented, and an administrator might unintentionally
perform dangerous actions. CVE assignments for this type of problem
seem uncommon, although that might be because the class of issues is
underreported. (The bug here seems to be a case of "doesn't even
notice whether check_mode is active" rather than "notices that
check_mode is active but proceeds unsafely." See also the
<http://blog.afistfulofservers.net/post/2012/12/21/promises-lies-and-dryrun-mode/>
blog post.)

Additional fixes for accelerate mode.

## 1.3.2 "Top of the World" (reprise) - September 19th, 2013

Multiple accelerate mode fixes:

* new /etc/ansible/facts.d allows JSON or INI-style facts to be provided from the remote node, and supports executable fact programs in this dir. Files must end in \*.fact.
* added the ability to make undefined template variables raise errors (see ansible.cfg)
* (DOCS PENDING) sudo: True/False and sudo\_user: True/False can be set at include and role level
* added changed\_when: (expression) which allows overriding whether a result is changed or not and can work with registered expressions
* --extra-vars can now take a file as input, e.g., "-e @filename" and can also be formatted as YAML
* external inventory scripts may now return host variables in one pass, which allows them to be much more efficient for large numbers of hosts
* if --forks exceeds the numbers of hosts, it will be automatically reduced. Set forks to 0 and you get "as many forks as I have hosts" out of the box.
* enabled error\_on\_undefined\_vars by default, which will make errors in playbooks more obvious
* role dependencies -- one role can now pull in another, with parameters of its own.
* added the ability to have tasks execute even during a check run (always\_run).

## 1.2.3 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- Aug 21, 2013

* Local security fixes for predictable file locations for ControlPersist and retry file paths on shared machines
  on operating systems without kernel symlink/hardlink protections.

## 1.2.2 "Hear About It Later" (reprise) -- July 4, 2013

* Added a configuration file option [paramiko\_connection] record\_host\_keys which allows the code that paramiko uses
  to update known\_hosts to be disabled. This is done because paramiko can be very slow at doing this if you have a
  large number of hosts and some folks may not want this behavior. This can be toggled independently of host key checking
  and does not affect the ssh transport plugin. Use of the ssh transport plugin is preferred if you have ControlPersist
  capability, and Ansible by default in 1.2.1 and later will autodetect.

## 1.2.1 "Hear About It Later" -- July 4, 2013

* Connection default is now "smart", which discovers if the system openssh can support ControlPersist, and uses
  it if so, if not falls back to paramiko.
* Host key checking is on by default. Disable it if you like by adding host\_key\_checking=False in the [default]
  section of /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg or ~/ansible.cfg or by exporting ANSIBLE\_HOST\_KEY\_CHECKING=False
* Paramiko now records host keys it was in contact with host key checking is on. It is somewhat sluggish when doing this,
  so switch to the 'ssh' transport if this concerns you.

## 1.2 "Right Now" -- June 10, 2013

Core Features:

* capability to set 'all\_errors\_fatal: True' in a playbook to force any error to stop execution versus
  a whole group or serial block needing to fail
  usable, without breaking the ability to override in ansible
* ability to use variables from {{ }} syntax in mainline playbooks, new 'when' conditional, as detailed
  in documentation. Can disable old style replacements in ansible.cfg if so desired, but are still active
  by default.
* can set ansible\_ssh\_private\_key\_file as an inventory variable (similar to ansible\_ssh\_host, etc)
* 'when' statement can be affixed to task includes to auto-affix the conditional to each task therein
* cosmetic: "\*\*\*\*\*" banners in ansible-playbook output are now constant width
* --limit can now be given a filename (--limit @filename) to constrain a run to a host list on disk
* failed playbook runs will create a retry file in /var/tmp/ansible usable with --limit
* roles allow easy arrangement of reusable tasks/handlers/files/templates
* pre\_tasks and post\_tasks allow for separating tasks into blocks where handlers will fire around them automatically
* "meta: flush\_handler" task capability added for when you really need to force handlers to run

* external inventory script added for Spacewalk / Red Hat Satellite servers
* It is now possible to feed JSON structures to --extra-vars. Pass in a JSON dictionary/hash to feed in complex data.

* more filters: ability to say {{ foo|success }} and {{ foo|failed }} and when: foo|success and when: foo|failed
* more filters: {{ path|basename }} and {{ path|dirname }}
* lookup plugins now use the basedir of the file they have included from, avoiding needs of ../../../ in places and
  increasing the ease at which things can be reorganized.

* setup module no longer saves to disk, template module now only used in playbooks
* setup module no longer needs to run twice per playbook
* apt module now passes DEBIAN\_FRONTEND=noninteractive
* mount module (manages active mounts + fstab)
* setup module fixes if no ipv6 support
* internals: template in common module boilerplate, also causes less SSH operations when used
* git module fixes
* setup module overhaul, more modular
* minor caching logic added to inventory to reduce hammering of inventory scripts.
* MySQL and PostgreSQL modules for user and db management
* vars\_prompt now supports private password entry (see examples/playbooks/prompts.yml)
* yum module modified to be more tolerant of plugins spewing random console messages (ex: RHN)

internals:

* when sudoing to root, still use /etc/ansible/setup as the metadata path, as if root
* paramiko is now only imported if needed when running from source checkout
* cowsay support on Ubuntu
* various ssh connection fixes for old Ubuntu clients
* ./hacking/test-module now supports options like ansible takes and has a debugger mode
* sudoing to a user other than root now works more seamlessly (uses /tmp, avoids umask issues)

## 0.5 "Amsterdam" ------- July 04, 2012

* Service module gets more accurate service states when running with upstart
* Jinja2 usage in playbooks (not templates), reinstated, supports %include directive
* support for --connection ssh (supports Kerberos, bastion hosts, etc), requires ControlMaster

* support for older versions of python-apt in the apt module
* a new "assemble" module, for constructing files from pieces of files (inspired by Puppet "fragments" idiom)
* ability to override most default values with ANSIBLE\_FOO environment variables
* --module-path parameter can support multiple directories separated with the OS path separator
* with\_items can take a variable of type list
* ansible\_python\_interpreter variable available for systems with more than one Python
* BIOS and VMware "fact" upgrades
* cowsay is used by ansible-playbook if installed to improve output legibility (try installing it)
* authorized\_key module

* added --verbose, which shows output from successful playbook operations
* print the output of the raw command inside /usr/bin/ansible as with command/shell
* basic setup module support for Solaris
* ./library relative to the playbook is always in path so modules can be included in tarballs with playbooks

## 0.4 "Unchained" ------- May 23, 2012

Internals/Core

* internal inventory API now more object oriented, parsers decoupled
* async handling improvements
* misc fixes for running ansible on OS X (overlord only)
* sudo improvements, now works much more smoothly
* sudo to a particular user with -U/--sudo-user, or using 'sudo\_user: foo' in a playbook
* --private-key CLI option to work with pem files

Inventory

* can use -i host1,host2,host3:port to specify hosts not in inventory (replaces --override-hosts)

* groups and users module takes an optional system=yes|no on creation (default no)
* list of hosts in playbooks can be expressed as a YAML list in addition to ; delimited

Playbooks

* variables can be replaced like ${foo.nested\_hash\_key.nested\_subkey[array\_index]}
* unicode now ok in templates (assumes utf8)
* able to pass host specifier or group name in to "hosts:" with --extra-vars

  per host and per group
* variables in playbooks can be structured/nested versus just a flat namespace
* manpage upgrades (docs)
* various bugfixes

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# CVE-2014-4660

| **Name** | CVE-2014-4660 |

| **Description** | Ansible before 1.5.5 constructs filenames containing user and password fields on the basis of deb lines in sources.list, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive credential information in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging existence of a file that uses the "deb http://user:pass@server:port/" format. |
