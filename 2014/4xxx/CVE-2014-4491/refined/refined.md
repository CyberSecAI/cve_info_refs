Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-4491:

**Vulnerability:**
*   **Root Cause:** An information disclosure vulnerability existed in the handling of APIs related to kernel extensions. Specifically, responses containing an `OSBundleMachOHeaders` key may have included kernel addresses.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the way the system handled and returned kernel addresses via specific APIs, failing to properly randomize or obfuscate these addresses.
*   **Impact:** This vulnerability could aid attackers in bypassing Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection. By obtaining kernel addresses, attackers can better predict the memory layout, which makes exploitation of other vulnerabilities easier.
*  **Attack vector:** A malicious application can exploit this vulnerability through APIs related to kernel extensions.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:**
    *   A malicious application running on the device is required to trigger the vulnerable code.
    *   The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system.

**Affected Systems:**
*   Apple TV 3rd generation and later
*   iPhone 4s and later
*   iPod touch (5th generation) and later
*   iPad 2 and later
*   OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5
*   OS X Mavericks v10.9.5
*   OS X Yosemite v10.10 and v10.10.1

**Mitigation:**
*   The issue was addressed by "unsliding" the addresses before returning them, effectively randomizing or obfuscating the kernel addresses.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by @PanguTeam and Stefan Esser.
* The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue, not a direct code execution vulnerability. It weakens ASLR protections, which can help attackers with code execution exploits.
