## Synopsis

Moderate: ppc64-diag security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0383)

## Topic

Updated ppc64-diag packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The ppc64-diag packages provide diagnostic tools for Linux on the 64-bit
PowerPC platforms. The platform diagnostics write events reported by the
firmware to the service log, provide automated responses to urgent events,
and notify system administrators or connected service frameworks about the
reported events.

Multiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in the way the
ppc64-diag utility created certain temporary files. A local attacker could
possibly use either of these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack and
overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
ppc64-diag, or obtain sensitive information from the temporary files.
(CVE-2014-4038, CVE-2014-4039)

The ppc64-diag packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.6.7, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version
including support for hot plugging of QEMU PCI devices. (BZ#1088493,
BZ#1084062)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Prior to this update, the rtas\_errd daemon was not started by default on

system boot. With this update, rtas\_errd has been modified to start
automatically by default. (BZ#1170146)

* Previously, the /var/log/dump file was not automatically created when

installing the ppc64-diag package. This bug has been fixed, and
/var/log/dump is now created at package install time as expected.
(BZ#1175808)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement:

* This update adds support for building the ppc64-diag packages on the

little-endian variant of IBM Power Systems platform architecture. (BZ#1124007)

Users of ppc64-diag are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

Are you reporting this as a prrn_hotplug vulnerability? If it were a
vulnerability, it would have a separate CVE ID. We didn't test the
code, but it looks more like an opportunity for a non-security
enhancement or maybe a bug fix. Our guess is:

  1. If the return value is nonzero, stdout is an empty string.

  2. All of the ">> $TMPFILE" will fail, and won't write anything into
     any file.

  3. The outcome is that /var/log/prrn_log doesn't have log
     information about what happened. We don't know of any direct
     security implications.

  4. Possibly the code should check the return value and print
     something like "mktemp failed - maybe you're out of /tmp disk
     space?" but it might be better to let the rest of the script run
     anyway (i.e., not abort after that error condition).

At least for now, there is no CVE ID for prrn_hotplug.

> I don't know if the data in /tmp/diagSEsnap is sensitive or not

  mkdir "/tmp/diagSEsnap", 0775;
  $general_eed_file = "/tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz";
  system("/usr/sbin/snap -o $general_eed_file 2>/dev/null 1>&2");

This seems to be similar to the CVE-2014-3925 sosreport issue.
snapH.tar.gz apparently will include /etc/fstab and therefore might
include a password.
<http://www.ibm.com/support/entry/portal/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-54819>
says "When you report a problem to IBM Technical Support, run the snap
utility and send the ... file to them." In addition, snapH.tar.gz
apparently will include /var/log/messages, which traditionally is not
supposed to be a world-readable file.

(snap and sosreport aren't derivatives of the same code.)

Also, the question of whether "/usr/sbin/snap -o $general_eed_file" is
exploitable may depend on the behavior of snap. Apparently, snap does
check whether the -o output file exists but doesn't avoid TOCTOU
problems. Arguably, snap isn't responsible for avoiding TOCTOU
problems because it's not inherently designed for use with untrusted
output filenames.

So, three CVEs seems to be the right number here.

The ppc64-diag unsafe uses of temporary directories in these three
scenarios:

  "> /tmp/get_dt_files" [ in rtas_errd/diag_support.c ]

  mkdir "/tmp/diagSEsnap", 0775;
  $general_eed_file = "/tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz";
  system("/usr/sbin/snap -o $general_eed_file 2>/dev/null 1>&2");
  [ in scripts/ppc64_diag_mkrsrc ]

  TMP_DIR="/var/tmp/ras"
  mkdir -p $TMP_DIR
  MESSAGE_FILE="$TMP_DIR/messages"
  [ in lpd/test/lpd_ela_test.sh - see Novell bug 882667 ]

are primarily of interest because of symlink following, and are all
assigned CVE-2014-4038.

A second CVE for the ppc64-diag product is for the choice of weak
directory/file permissions for the snapH.tar.gz archive including data
that is not locally world-readable (e.g., /var/log/messages). This is
CVE-2014-4039.

A third CVE, CVE-2014-4040, is assigned for snap itself. snap can be
found at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/powerpc-utils> (i.e., it's not
part of the ppc64-diag product). This CVE is the one analogous to
<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3925> (i.e., it
includes the "cleartext passwords ... lacks a warning" rationale).

CVE-2014-4039 and CVE-2014-4040 are vulnerabilities in different
products and can be addressed independently. For example, snapH.tar.gz
could have restrictive local permissions and still be sent to a remote
destination without review. Alternatively, snapH.tar.gz could continue
to have weak local permissions but snap could require the user to
acknowledge a warning about off-site distribution of an fstab
password, etc.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-13 18:41:44 UTC  ``` As noted in the SUSE bug report [1], numerous /tmp race conditions exist in ppc64-diag, in particular:  rtas_errd/diag_support.c:233:   char command[]="/usr/bin/find /proc/device-tree -name status -print > /tmp/get_dt_files"; rtas_errd/diag_support.c:241:   fp1 = fopen("/tmp/get_dt_files", "r"); rtas_errd/prrn_hotplug:8:TMPFILE=`mktemp -p /tmp` scripts/ppc64_diag_mkrsrc:126:mkdir "/tmp/diagSEsnap", 0775; scripts/ppc64_diag_mkrsrc:127:$general_eed_file = "/tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz";  In the case of rtas_errd/prrn_hotplug, mktemp is used but is assumed to have succeeded; there is no check for the return value.  mktemp should probably be used properly in all of these.  I don't know if the data in /tmp/diagSEsnap is sensitive or not, but if it is, the permissions on that directory should probably be tightened up.  No CVE(s) have been assigned to these issues as of yet.  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=882667>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-17 20:22:50 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned the following CVEs to these issues:  Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2014-4038](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4038) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2014-4038](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4038) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4038> Assigned: 20140612 Reference: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/17/1> Reference: <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=882667> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1109371](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-4038 CVE-2014-4039 ppc64-diag: multiple temporary file races")  ppc64-diag 2.6.1 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack related to (1) rtas_errd/diag_support.c and /tmp/get_dt_files, (2) scripts/ppc64_diag_mkrsrc and /tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz, or (3) lpd/test/lpd_ela_test.sh and /var/tmp/ras.   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2014-4039](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4039) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2014-4039](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4039) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4039> Assigned: 20140612 Reference: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/06/17/1> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1109371](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-4038 CVE-2014-4039 ppc64-diag: multiple temporary file races")  ppc64-diag 2.6.1 uses 0775 permissions for /tmp/diagSEsnap and does not properly restrict permissions for /tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading files in this archive, as demonstrated by /var/log/messages and /etc/yaboot.conf.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371#c2)  Josh Bressers    2014-06-30 20:05:05 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-03-05 09:09:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2015:0383 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0383.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 06:29:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2015:1320 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1320.html>   ``` |  |

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

Don't the other files deserve a more specific context, too? I am trying to find a way to speed up the process as there are many of them.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1131501#c3)  Martin Žember    2014-08-19 15:49:43 UTC  ``` There are no transition rules if a initrc_t-labeled process creates the file: # sesearch -s initrc_t -t var_lock_t -c file -T  The daemon itself does not create it: # sesearch -s rtas_errd_t -t var_lock_t -c file -T Found 1 semantic te rules:    type_transition rtas_errd_t var_lock_t : file rtas_errd_var_lock_t;   It is /etc/init.d/rtas_errd who creates it by 'touch'.  Solution: either run 'restorecon' from within /etc/init.d/rtas_errd or create the lock file in the daemon.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1131501#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 06:29:31 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1109371#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-13 18:41:44 UTC  ``` As noted in the SUSE bug report [1], numerous /tmp race conditions exist in ppc64-diag, in particular:  rtas_errd/diag_support.c:233:   char command[]="/usr/bin/find /proc/device-tree -name status -print > /tmp/get_dt_files"; rtas_errd/diag_support.c:241:   fp1 = fopen("/tmp/get_dt_files", "r"); rtas_errd/prrn_hotplug:8:TMPFILE=`mktemp -p /tmp` scripts/ppc64_diag_mkrsrc:126:mkdir "/tmp/diagSEsnap", 0775; scripts/ppc64_diag_mkrsrc:127:$general_eed_file = "/tmp/diagSEsnap/snapH.tar.gz";  In the case of rtas_errd/prrn_hotplug, mktemp is used but is assumed to have succeeded; there is no check for the return value.  mktemp should probably be used properly in all of these.  I don't know if the data in /tmp/diagSEsnap is sensitive or not, but if it is, the permissions on that directory should probably be tightened up.

# RHSA-2015:1320 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: ppc64-diag security, bug fix and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A1320)

## Topic

Updated ppc64-diag packages that fix two security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The ppc64-diag packages provide diagnostic tools for Linux on the 64-bit
PowerPC platforms. The platform diagnostics write events reported by the
firmware to the service log, provide automated responses to urgent events,
and notify system administrators or connected service frameworks about the
reported events.

Multiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in the way the
ppc64-diag utility created certain temporary files. A local attacker could
possibly use either of these flaws to perform a symbolic link attack and
overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
ppc64-diag, or obtain sensitive information from the temporary files.
(CVE-2014-4038, CVE-2014-4039)

The ppc64-diag packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.6.7, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version.
(BZ#1148142)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Previously, the "explain\_syslog" and "syslog\_to\_svclog" commands failed

with a "No such file or directory" error message. With this update, the
ppc64-diag package specifies the location of the message\_catalog directory
correctly, which prevents the described error from occurring. (BZ#1139655)

* Prior to this update, the /var/lock/subsys/rtas\_errd file was incorrectly

labeled for SELinux as "system\_u:object\_r:var\_lock\_t:s0". This update
corrects the SELinux label to "system\_u:object\_r:rtas\_errd\_var\_lock\_t:s0".
(BZ#1131501)

Users of ppc64-diag are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.
