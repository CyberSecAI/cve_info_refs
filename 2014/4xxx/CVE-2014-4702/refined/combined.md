Subject: Re: CVE requests: nagios check_dhcp plug-in: read parts of INI config files belonging to root

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is a somewhat unusual situation for CVE because there are two
cases in which a researcher reported a subset of the problem, and then
a vendor fix was announced that apparently addressed the problem
without modifying the component mentioned by the researcher.

> <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74>
>
> This was fixed in version 2.0.2:
>
> <<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/>>

Use CVE-2014-4701 for the report in
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74> stating that check_dhcp
is affected. (<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/>
is also an applicable reference for this CVE.)

Use CVE-2014-4702 for the report in
<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/> stating that
check_icmp is affected. This is new vector information announced at a
different time by a different party.

(From a practical perspective, someone might have been tracking Nagios
Plugins security on the basis of fulldisclosure posts, and decided to
"fix" <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74> by simply
deleting the check_dhcp plugin. In this case, CVE-2014-4702 is useful
because that installation was still vulnerable after that
CVE-2014-4701 remediation action.)

> <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/141>
>
> This was fixed in version 2.0.3:
>
> <<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/>>

Use CVE-2014-4703 for the report in
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/141> stating that
check_dhcp is affected.
(<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/> is also an
applicable reference for this CVE.)

Here, the vendor did not announce any additional vector information
(and only referred to "the SUID vulnerability discovered by David
Golunski") so we can't assign a fourth CVE ID for the
<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/> post. It's
possible that this is actually a parallel situation, so if anyone
wants to announce an issue in 2.0.2 that's not specifically about
check_dhcp, an additional CVE ID could be assigned.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Nagios Plugins 2.0.2 Released

The Nagios Plugins Development Team is proud to announce that [nagios-plugins 2.0.2](http://nagios-plugins.org/downloads/?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.2%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "download nagios-plugins 2.0.2") has been released and is available for [download](http://nagios-plugins.org/downloads/?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.2%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "download nagios-plugins 2.0.2").

This release was prompted a bit earlier than originally expected by a newly discovered security vulnerability reported by Dawid Golunski on [exploit-db](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33387/ "exploit-db"). It concerned an arbitrary file access vulnerability with the SUID binaries (check\_icmp, check\_dhcp) and the extra-opts configure flag (which is enabled by default).  Fixes were applied globally, so the new restrictions on fopen should apply to all plugins.

Additionally, a few plugins were updated to successfully build on windows under cygwin, and some small changes were made to plugin output and verbosity.

A full list of included enhancements and fixes are listed below:

**SECURITY FIXES**

* Fixed file access vulnerability with SUID binaries (check\_icmp, check\_dhcp) and extra-opts.  Fixes were applied globally, so the new resrictions on fopen should apply to all plugins. Special thanks to Dawid Golunski for the submission. More information: [http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33387/](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33387/ "exploit-db")  (sreinhardt) (emislivec)

**ENHANCEMENTS**

* check\_disk – Now compiles in cygwin on windows (Gunnar Beutner)
* check\_ping – Now compiles in cygwin on windows (Gunnar Beutner)
* check\_users – Now compiles in cygwin on windows (Gunnar Beutner)
* netutils.c – Connection error verbosity increased. C plugins will now differentiate file socket errors from connection errors (Davide Madrisan)

**FIXES**

* check\_nt.c – Changed ‘Mb’ to ‘MB’ in MEMUSE output for clarity (abrist)

Thanks to all who have contributed toward this release. If you need assistance installing or using the plugins, please visit our [general support forum](http://support.nagios.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=7?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.2%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "Visit general support forum").

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
