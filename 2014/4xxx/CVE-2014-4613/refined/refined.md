```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Piwigo application does not require multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when performing certain sensitive actions via HTTP requests to ws.php.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a user into performing actions on their behalf, such as creating arbitrary users.
- **Attack vectors:** By tricking a user into following a specially crafted link, the attacker can induce the victim's browser to send a crafted request to ws.php.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link and persuade a logged-in Piwigo user to access it. The attacker does not need direct access to the application.
