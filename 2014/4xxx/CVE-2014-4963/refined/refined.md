{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "vulnerability": "Remote Command Execution",
      "root_cause": "The application uses Apache Struts 2.2.1.1, which is vulnerable to Remote Command Execution. This is due to the use of OGNL expressions in request parameters which can be manipulated to execute arbitrary code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use of vulnerable Struts version",
        "Insecure handling of user input",
        "Lack of input validation and sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server. This could lead to complete compromise of the application and underlying system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted HTTP requests with malicious OGNL expressions in parameters, exploiting a Struts vulnerability."
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application."
    },
    {
      "vulnerability": "Manipulation of product prices",
       "root_cause": "The application does not properly validate product quantities, allowing negative quantities to be specified in shopping cart calculations.  It also allows negative quantities in the standalone shopping cart feature.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Lack of business logic validation in price calculation",
        "Improper handling of product quantities in cart."
      ],
      "impact": "Customers can purchase products for significantly reduced prices, or even for negative prices, leading to financial loss for the shop owner.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating HTTP requests during the checkout process to include negative quantities."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a registered user and able to make purchases from the web application."
    },
   {
      "vulnerability": "Manipulation of customer data / mass assignment",
      "root_cause": "The application allows modification of customer data by manipulating the 'customerId' parameter in requests, which allows mass assignment of data to unintended users. Additionally, a malicious admin can change passwords via a hidden parameter.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of proper authorization checks",
        "Insecure data handling",
        "Missing input validation",
        "Mass assignment vulnerabilities"
      ],
     "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to other user accounts by overwriting their details (including password), access sensitive data, and modify shipping/billing information. Admin accounts can modify arbitrary user passwords.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Modifying HTTP request parameters when registering new users or modifying user details.",
        "Appending a password parameter in HTTP request to admin interface"

    {
      "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
        "root_cause": "The application does not implement proper CSRF protection mechanisms. This is exploitable in multiple places in both the shopping interface and admin panel.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing CSRF tokens or other anti-CSRF protections."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can force logged-in users to perform unintended actions on the webshop, such as changing passwords, shop configuration, product details, product prices, and posting reviews. This can be used to deface web pages, redirect user traffic, steal or alter sensitive data, or even disable functionality.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Tricking a logged-in user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a malicious web page containing an HTTP request to the vulnerable application."
      ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in user to click on the malicious link or visit the malicious page."
    },
    {
      "vulnerability": "Missing anti brute force protection",
       "root_cause": "The application does not implement any form of protection against brute-force login attempts. The password policy also only enforces a length between 6-8 characters, allowing for easy cracking.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of brute-force protection mechanisms",
         "Weak password policy"
      ],
       "impact": "Attackers can easily attempt to guess passwords for user accounts, potentially gaining access to user or admin accounts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Repeated login attempts with different username/password combinations."
       ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the web application login page."
    },
    {
      "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "root_cause": "The application does not sanitize user inputs properly, leading to reflected XSS vulnerabilities in the admin interface.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input sanitization",
        "Improper handling of user input"

      "impact": "Attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of web pages.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting HTTP requests that include malicious JavaScript code in parameters that are not properly sanitized and are reflected in the web page."
        ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. The user must then view the attacker's crafted output in their web browser."
