{
  "CVE-2014-4141": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CAttrArray object in Internet Explorer reallocates a memory buffer to grow it in size. The original buffer is copied to the newly allocated memory and then freed. The code continues to use the freed copy of the buffer, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper memory management.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.",
     "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted webpage that triggers the memory reallocation and subsequent use of the freed memory.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted webpage."
