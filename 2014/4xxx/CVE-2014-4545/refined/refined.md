Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-4545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `pq_dialog.php` file of the Proquoter WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `leftorright` and `author` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This means that malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the query parameters and executed in the victim's browser when they load the crafted URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session information.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform other actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript within the `leftorright` and `author` query parameters of the `pq_dialog.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability (Unauthenticated access).
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute a malicious URL that a user would then click on or be redirected to.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example demonstrates how an attacker would inject the payload `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` into both `leftorright` and `author` parameters to trigger an alert box, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability:
  `http://localhot/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/proquoter/pq_dialog.php?leftorright=leftorright%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&author=author%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&`

**Additional Notes**
- The plugin was closed on January 11, 2014, suggesting that the vulnerability was not fixed before the plugin was removed from the official repository.
- The public disclosure of the vulnerability was on May 25, 2014.
- The plugin was identified to be vulnerable in version 1 and most probably lower versions.
