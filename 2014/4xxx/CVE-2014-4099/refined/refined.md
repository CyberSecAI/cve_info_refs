Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue that occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. Specifically, this is related to how the browser handles objects and their memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is the potential for memory corruption due to improper object handling in the browser's memory management.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this specific vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service condition. This means the browser becomes unresponsive, and the user cannot continue browsing.
*   **Note:** While other memory corruption vulnerabilities listed in the same advisory lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), CVE-2014-4099 is specifically categorized as a DoS vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the memory corruption vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Malicious content designed to exploit the vulnerability could also be injected into compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince a user to visit the malicious webpage, often by tricking them into clicking a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick users into visiting the malicious website. No direct access to the victim's machine or network is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability affects Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, and 11 on both Windows clients and servers.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*   While the exploit is not known to be publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the bulletin, the potential impact is a DoS.
*   The advisory provides mitigations and workarounds, such as configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting.
*   The provided document also contains a list of acknowledgments for individuals and organizations that worked with Microsoft to report this and other vulnerabilities, but does not specify who specifically reported CVE-2014-4099. Specifically, SkyLined is credited with reporting CVE-2014-4099 to HP's Zero Day Initiative

**Summary:**
CVE-2014-4099 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer that can be triggered by a specially crafted webpage. It leads to a denial of service condition by causing memory issues when the browser tries to access an object in memory. The attack vector is through social engineering to convince a user to visit a malicious page.
