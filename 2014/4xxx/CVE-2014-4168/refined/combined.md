Thanks!

I suppose we also need the fix in (old?-)stable; and it might also
make sense to upload the current 0.6 package with only this fix to
unstable with urgency high before looking into 0.7.0.

Unfortunately the patch doesn't apply cleanly (neither against
0.6.0~rc1-18 in Debian nor against the iodine-0.6 branch in upstream
git). I've tried to resolve the merge conflicts and came up with the
attached patch.

Could the two of you please take a look at it to check if it's sane?
-- Which it probably isn't since the tests fail now; or the test
suite needs more adoption as well ... *sigh*

@Erik: Maybe you could also backport the fix to the iodine-0.6
branch?

Closes: [751834](bugreport.cgi?bug=751834)
Changes:
 iodine (0.6.0~rc1-19) unstable; urgency=high
 .
   * Add patch 0001-Fix-authentication-bypass-bug.patch from upstream's
     iodine-0.6.0 branch.
 .
     This fixes a security problem where the client could bypass the password
     check by continuing after getting an error from the server and guessing
     the network parameters and the server would still accept the rest of the
     setup and also network traffic. The patch adds checks for normal and raw
     mode that user has authenticated before allowing any other communication.
 .
     Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso for the bug report, and Erik Ekman for
     backporting the fix super fast.

 .
   * Add patch 0001-Fix-authentication-bypass-bug.patch from upstream's
     iodine-0.6.0 branch.
 .
     This fixes a security problem where the client could bypass the password
     check by continuing after getting an error from the server and guessing
     the network parameters and the server would still accept the rest of the
     setup and also network traffic. The patch adds checks for normal and raw
     mode that user has authenticated before allowing any other communication.

     Thanks to Salvatore Bonaccorso for the bug report, and Erik Ekman for
     backporting the fix super fast.

Package        : iodine
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-4168
Debian Bug     : 751834

Oscar Reparaz discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in
iodine, a tool for tunneling IPv4 data through a DNS server. A remote
attacker could provoke a server to accept the rest of the setup or
also network traffic by exploiting this flaw.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0~rc1-12+deb7u1.

For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0~rc1-19.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0~rc1-19.

We recommend that you upgrade your iodine packages.

CHANGES:
master: - Partial IPv6 support (#107) Client can connect to iodined through an relaying IPv6 nameserver. Server only supports IPv4 for now. Traffic inside tunnel is IPv4. - Add socket activation for systemd, by Michael Scherer. - Add automated lookup of external ip (via -n auto). - Bugfix for OS X (Can't assign requested address) - Fix DNS tunneling bug caused by uninitialized variable, #94 - Handle spaces when entering password interactively, fixes #93. Patch by Hagar. - Add -R option to set OpenBSD routing domain for the DNS socket. Patch by laurent at gouloum fr, fixes #95. - Add android patches and makefile, from Marcel Bokhorst, fixes #105. - Added missing break in iodine.c, by Pavel Pergamenshchik, #108. - A number of minor patches from Frank Denis, Gregor Herrmann and Barak A. Pearlmutter. - Testcase compilation fixes for OS X and FreeBSD - Do not let sockets be inherited by sub-processes, fixes #99. - Add unspecified RR type (called PRIVATE; id 65399, in private use range). For servers with RFC3597 support. Fixes #97. - Fix authentication bypass vulnerability; found by Oscar Reparaz.
2010-02-06: 0.6.0-rc1 "Hotspotify" - Fixed tunnel not working on Windows. - Any device name is now supported on Windows, fixes #47. - Multiple installed TAP32 interfaces are now supported, fixes #46. - Return nonzero if tunnel fails to open, fixes #62. - Support for setting a SELinux context, based on patch by Sebastien Raveau. Sample context file in doc/iodine.te - Allow listen port and DNS forward port to be the same if listen IP does not include localhost. - The client will now exit if configuring IP or MTU fails. - The starting cache miss value is randomized at startup, fixes #65. - Raw UDP mode added. If the iodined server is reachable directly, packets can be sent to it without DNS encoding. Fixes #36. - Do not overwrite users CC/CFLAGS/LDFLAGS, only add to them. - Added -F option to write pidfile, based on patch from misc at mandriva.org. Fixes #70. - Allow password to be set via environment variable, fixes #77. Based on patch by logix. - Client now prints server tunnel IP, fixes #78. Patch by logix. - Fix build error on Mac OS X 10.6, patch by G. Rischard. #79. - Added support for CNAME/TXT/A/MX query types, fixes #75. Patch by Anne Bezemer, merge help by logix. - Merged low-latency patch from Anne Bezemer, fixes #76. - Resolve client nameserver argument if given as hostname, fixes #82. - Open log before chroot, fixes #86: logging on FreeBSD. - Merged big bugfix patch from Anne Bezemer, #88.
2009-06-01: 0.5.2 "WifiFree" - Fixed client segfault on OS X, #57 - Added check that nameserver lookup was successful - Fixed ENOTSOCK error on OS X and FreeBSD, #58.
2009-03-21: 0.5.1 "Boringo" - Added initial Windows support, fixes #43. - Added length check of autoprobe responses - Refactored and added unit tests - Added syslog logging for iodined on version and login packets - Fixed segfault when encoding just one block, fixes #51. The normal code was never affected by this. - Added win32 code to read DNS server from system, fixes #45. - Disabled password echo on win32, fixes #44. - Fix encoding error making all autoprobing > 1024 bytes fail, #52. - Increase default interface MTU to 1200. - Fix autoprobing error making every third probe fail, set IP flag Dont-Fragment where supported. Fixes #54. - Added TAP32 version 0901 as accepted (#53).
2009-01-23: 0.5.0 "iPassed" - Fixed segfault in server when sending version reject. - Applied patch to make iodine build on BeOS R5-BONE and Haiku, from Francois Revol. Still work to do to get tun device working. - Added capability to forward DNS queries outside tunnel domain to a nameserver on localhost. Use -b port to enable, fixes #31. - iodined now replies to NS request on its own domain, fixes issue #33. The destination IP address is sent as reply. Use -n to specify a specific IP address to return (if behind NAT etc). - Upstream data is now Base64 encoded if relay server preserves case and supports the plus (+) character in domain names, fixes #16. - Fixed problem in client when DNS trans. ID has highest bit set (#37) - IP addresses are now assigned within the netmask, so iodined can use any address for itself, fixes #28. - Netmask size is now adjustable. Setting a small net will reduce the number of users. Use x.x.x.x/n notation on iodined tunnel ip. This fixes #27. - Downstream data is now fragmented, and the fragment size is auto- probed after login. Fixes #7. It only took a few years :) - Enhanced the checks that validates incoming packets - Fixed endless loop in fragment size autodetection, #39. - Fixed broken hostname dot placing with specific lengths, #40.
2008-08-06: 0.4.2 "Opened Zone" - Applied a few small patches from Maxim Bourmistrov and Gregor Herrmann - Applied a patch for not creating and configuring the tun interface, Debian bug #477692 by Vincent Bernat, controlled by -s switch - Applied a security patch from Andrew Griffiths, use setgroups() to limit the groups of the user - Applied a patch to make iodine build on (Open)Solaris, from Albert Lee Needs TUN/TAP driver http://www.whiteboard.ne.jp/~admin2/tuntap/ Still needs more code in tun.c for opening/closing the device - Added option in server (-c) to disable IP/port checking on packets, will hopefully help when server is behind NAT - Fixed bug #21, now only IP address part of each packet is checked. Should remove the need for the -c option and also work with bugfixed DNS servers worldwide. - Added -D option on server to enable debugging. Debug level 1 now  prints info about each RX/TX datagram.
2007-11-30: 0.4.1 "Tea Online" - Introduced encoding API - Switched to new Base32 implementation - Added Base64 implementation that only uses 63 chars (not used yet) - Refined 'install' make target and use $(MAKE) for recursive calls - All received error messages (RCODE field) are echoed - Top domain limited to 128 chars - Case preservation check sent after login to decide codec - Fixed crash on incoming NULL query in server with bad top domain - /etc/resolv.conf is consulted if no nameserver is given on commandline - Applied patch from Matthew W. S. Bell (Detach before chroot/dropping priv)
2007-03-25: 0.4.0 "Run Home" - Added multiuser support (up to 8 users simultaneously) - Added authentication (password entered as argument or on stdin) - Added manpage - Added install/uninstall make target - Cleanup of dns code, more test cases, use check library - Changed directory structure

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
