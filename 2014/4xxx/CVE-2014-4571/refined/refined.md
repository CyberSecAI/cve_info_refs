Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4571:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `vn-calendar` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `fs` and `w` parameters within the `vncal.js.php` file are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This means that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who access the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser. This can lead to:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to accounts.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive information such as form data or other content on the page.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or downloading malware onto their computer.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the webpage.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that includes the vulnerable `fs` and `w` parameters in the query string of the `vncal.js.php` file. For example:
    ```
    http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/vn-calendar/vncal.js.php?cs=cs&fs=fs'><script>alert('XSS')</script>&ts=ts&w=w'><script>alert('XSS')</script>
    ```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Unauthenticated access:** An attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to exploit this vulnerability. They can simply craft a malicious URL and entice a user to click on it or access a page that includes it.
*   **User interaction:** Although not always required, the attack typically requires some user interaction, like a user visiting the crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerable version of the plugin is 1.0 and likely earlier versions.
* The plugin has been closed and has no known fix.
* The vulnerability was identified by Anantshri and publicly disclosed on June 12, 2014 after the vendor was contacted on January 15, 2014.
