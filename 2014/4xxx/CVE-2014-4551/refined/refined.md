CVE-2014-4551:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'testing' parameter of the diagnostics/test.php file.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'testing' parameter, leading to XSS.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
  - Attack vectors: By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the 'testing' parameter and tricking a user into clicking the link.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker can be unauthenticated.
  - Fixed in: Version 0.10.2
