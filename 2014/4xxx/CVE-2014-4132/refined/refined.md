Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4132:

**Verification:**

The provided content from the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-056 specifically mentions CVE-2014-4132 as an "Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability". Thus, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The specific type of memory corruption (e.g., heap overflow, use-after-free) is not specified, but the result is that an attacker can overwrite memory that they should not be able to write to.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit can lead to remote code execution (RCE) within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker gains complete control of the system. The attacker could then install software, alter data, or create new user accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted webpage. Attackers can host such a webpage or inject it into compromised websites or ads. Users must be tricked into visiting the malicious page, typically via phishing emails or links.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a web page.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting that page using Internet Explorer.
    *   No special privileges on the user's system are needed prior to exploitation, as the exploit runs in the context of the user.

**Additional Information:**

*   The security bulletin notes that by default, Internet Explorer on Windows Servers runs in a restricted mode called "Enhanced Security Configuration," which mitigates these vulnerabilities by reducing the likelihood of users downloading/running crafted content. However, this only applies to servers, not client machines.
*   The bulletin also notes that EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit) can help mitigate this vulnerability if installed and properly configured.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" on client systems and "Moderate" on servers.

In summary, CVE-2014-4132 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer that can be exploited through a specially crafted web page. A successful exploit leads to remote code execution, potentially giving an attacker full control of the affected system.
