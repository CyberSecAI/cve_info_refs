- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The smart proxy's TFTP boot file fetch API does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `path` parameter, before using it in a command-line call to `wget`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Remote Code Execution**: The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands into the `wget` call, leading to remote code execution.
    - **Path Traversal**:  An attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques in the destination path to write files to arbitrary locations outside of the intended TFTP root directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the smart proxy user. This could lead to full system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by making a POST request to the `/tftp/fetch_boot_file` endpoint of the smart proxy's API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the smart proxy's API endpoint. No authentication is explicitly mentioned, suggesting that access to the endpoint is sufficient for exploitation.
