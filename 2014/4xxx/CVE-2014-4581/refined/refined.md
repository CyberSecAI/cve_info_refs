Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4581:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `facture.php` file of the WPCB WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects the unsanitized `id` parameter back to the user, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameter which will be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Attackers can use the injected scripts to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as redirecting to phishing sites, modifying content, or performing other unauthorized operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that includes the payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable plugin:** The attacker must know of the existence of the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Ability to create malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to craft a URL with malicious JavaScript in the vulnerable `id` parameter of the `facture.php` file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The affected version is WPCB 2.4.8 and possibly earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was identified by Anantshri.
*   The vendor was contacted on January 17, 2014 and public disclosure occurred on June 4, 2014.
*   No fix is known for this issue.
