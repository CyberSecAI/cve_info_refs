Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4528:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `fbpromotions` WordPress plugin, specifically within the `swarm-settings.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present. This means that user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded before being displayed in the web page, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can inject malicious scripts into the web page through vulnerable parameters. This can allow attackers to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or deface the website.
- The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code, which could lead to a variety of attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests to the `swarm-settings.php` file within the plugin.
- The vulnerable parameters are `promo_type`, `fb_edit_action` and `promo_id`.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into these parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests and access the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable plugin is `fbpromotions`.
*   The identified vulnerability is an XSS.
*   The plugin version affected is 1.3.4 and potentially lower versions.
*   The PoC provided in the content shows how to inject a script using the `promo_type`, `fb_edit_action` and `promo_id` parameters.
*   The vendor was contacted on January 21, 2014 and the public disclosure happened on May 28, 2014.
