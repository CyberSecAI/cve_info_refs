Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2014-4363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Safari autofills saved passwords. It was filling passwords on HTTP sites, HTTPS sites with broken trust (invalid certificates), and within iframes, regardless of the parent frame's origin or security context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure password autofill mechanism.
- Lack of proper validation of the security context (HTTPS with valid certificate) before autofilling passwords.
- Autofilling passwords within iframes without considering the main frame's origin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with a privileged network position could intercept user credentials by forcing a user to visit a malicious site (HTTP or HTTPS with broken trust) or by injecting a malicious iframe into a legitimate site, leading to the exposure of saved credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: An attacker positioned on the network can intercept HTTP requests/responses or manipulate HTTPS communication with invalid certificates.
- Malicious Website: A malicious website using HTTP or HTTPS with an invalid certificate can trick the browser into autofilling saved passwords.
- Malicious Iframe injection: Injecting a malicious iframe into a legitimate website could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Privileged network position: Ability to intercept or manipulate network traffic.
- Ability to host or inject malicious content.
- No need for user interaction besides browsing to a malicious website or a compromised one.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Safari 6.2 and 7.1 on OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5 and OS X Mavericks v10.9.5, and also in Safari on iOS devices.
- This vulnerability was fixed by restricting password autofill to the main frame of HTTPS sites with valid certificate chains.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by David Silver, Suman Jana, and Dan Boneh of Stanford University working with Eric Chen and Collin Jackson of Carnegie Mellon University.
