The provided document includes information about CVE-2014-4432.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `fdesetup` command provided misleading status for the state of encryption on disk after updating settings but before rebooting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the inaccurate reporting of disk encryption status by `fdesetup` command prior to a system reboot after settings update.

**Impact of exploitation:**  The primary impact of this vulnerability is that the user may receive incorrect information about disk encryption status. This may mislead users into believing their disk is encrypted when it is not, potentially leaving their data unprotected.

**Attack vectors:** This is a local issue. No remote attack vector is apparent, because the misleading status information is presented to the local user after they use `fdesetup`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user needs to have privileges to use the `fdesetup` command.
