  {
    "CVE": "CVE-2014-4019",
    "Root cause": "The router's rom-0 backup file, which contains sensitive information including the router password, can be downloaded without authentication via a simple GET request.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure direct object reference",
      "Information disclosure",
      "Missing authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can gain access to sensitive router information including the router password, which can lead to full control over the router and network.",
    "Attack vectors": "A simple GET request to `/rom-0` on the router's web interface.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to reach the router's web interface, typically on the local network or have access through a compromised device on the same network."
