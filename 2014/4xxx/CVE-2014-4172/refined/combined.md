```
Problem: We currently don't pass encoded values to the server, possibly resolving in parsing/extraction errors.
Solution: URL Encode all values instead of just the service url.

QA Notes: Added unit test.

Package        : php-cas
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-4172
Debian Bug     : 759718

Marvin S. Addison discovered that Jasig phpCAS, a PHP library for the
CAS authentication protocol, did not encode tickets before adding them
to an URL, creating a possibility for cross site scripting.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-4+deb7u1.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-cas packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

# Security Bug Tracker

The data in this tracker comes solely from the bug database maintained
by Debian's security team located in the security-tracker Git [repository](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/tree/master/data). The data represented here is derived from: [DSAs](https://www.debian.org/security/#DSAS) issued by the Security Team; issues tracked in the [CVE database](https://www.cve.org/), issues tracked in the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (NVD), maintained by NIST; and security issues
discovered in Debian packages as reported in the BTS.

All external data (including Debian bug reports and official Debian
security advisories) must be added to this database before it appears
here. Please help us keep this information up-to-date by [reporting](/tracker/data/report) any discrepancies or change of status that you are
aware of and/or help us improve the quality of this information by [participating](/tracker/data/report).

Since the ticket is under control of the user, it should be URL encoded when presented for validation as a precaution.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# [[cas-user] CAS Client Security Vulnerability CVE-2014-4172](/search?l=cas-user@lists.jasig.org&q=subject:%22%5C%5Bcas%5C-user%5C%5D+CAS+Client+Security+Vulnerability+CVE%5C-2014%5C-4172%22&o=newest)

[Marvin Addison](/search?l=cas-user@lists.jasig.org&q=from:%22Marvin+Addison%22)
[Mon, 11 Aug 2014 09:04:44 -0700](/search?l=cas-user@lists.jasig.org&q=date:20140811)

```
A critical security vulnerability has been discovered in several Jasig
CAS clients that allows URL parameter injection due to improper URL
encoding at the back-channel ticket validation step of the CAS
protocol. The following CVE number has been assigned to track this
vulnerability:
```
```

CVE-2014-4172

Affected Software
----------------------------------------
Jasig Java CAS Client
Vulnerable versions: <3.3.2
Fix version: 3.3.2, <http://search.maven.org/#browse%7C1586013685>

.NET CAS Client
Vulnerable versions: <1.0.2
Fix version: 1.0.2,
<http://downloads.jasig.org/cas-clients/dotnet/dotnet-client-1.0.2-bin.zip>

phpCAS
Vulnerable versions: <1.3.3
Fix version: 1.3.3,
<http://downloads.jasig.org/cas-clients/php/1.3.3/CAS-1.3.3.tgz>

There may be other CAS clients that are vulnerable.

Impact
----------------------------------------
The nature of the vulnerability allows malicious remote (network)
agents to craft attack URLs that bypass security constraints of the
CAS protocol. The following attack scenarios are known and have been
demonstrated:

1. A malicious service that can obtain a valid ticket can use it to
access another service in violation of the CAS protocol requirement
that a ticket issued for a service can only be used to access the
service for which the ticket was granted. This type of access amounts
to an illicit proxy: the attacker is proxying authentication for the
target.
2. A malicious user can request a ticket for service A and use it to
access service B with the access privileges of A.

Attacks like scenario 1 could result in unauthorized data disclosure,
while scenario 2 could result in privilege escalation. Other attack
scenarios may be possible.

Remediation
----------------------------------------
Upgrade affected CAS clients as soon as possible. Consider mitigation
if upgrading is not possible.

Mitigation
----------------------------------------
The CAS Service Management facility [1], which is enabled by default,
can be used to restrict services that are permitted to use CAS (i.e.
allowed to request tickets). Whitelisting trusted services can reduce
the scope of attacks like scenario 1 above.

The following servlet filter may provide additional defense at the CAS
server against some forms of this attack:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
