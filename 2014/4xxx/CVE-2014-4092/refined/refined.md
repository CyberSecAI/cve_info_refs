Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability. This occurs when Internet Explorer incorrectly accesses memory locations, leading to exploitable states.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This can include installing programs, viewing, modifying, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:**
    - An attacker hosts a malicious website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
    - Compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content can also be used.
    - The attacker would need to convince users to visit the malicious website, typically through social engineering tactics (e.g., links in emails or instant messages).
- **Email Attachments:** An attacker could send a malicious file through email that, when opened, would exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage or open a malicious file.
- **Malicious Content Creation:** The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted webpage or file that triggers the memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
- **No Special Network Position:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (8, 9, 10 and 11).
- The severity is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The update (2977629) addresses this vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- There are workarounds (such as disabling Active Scripting or setting security zones to high), however they may impact the functionality of some websites.
- Microsoft acknowledges Bo Qu of Palo Alto Networks, A3F2160DCA1BDE70DA1D99ED267D5DC1EC336192, and Jason Kratzer for reporting the vulnerability.
