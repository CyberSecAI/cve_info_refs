  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2014-4167",
    "description": "The L3-agent in OpenStack Neutron would inappropriately apply SNAT rules to IPv6 subnets. This leads to a failure when iptables-restore is called because it cannot handle an IPv6 prefix. An authenticated attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service, preventing further floating IPv4 addresses from being attached throughout the cloud. Removal of the faulty network cannot be done using the API and must be cleaned at the database level. Only Neutron setups using IPv6 and L3-agent are affected.",
    "root_cause": "The L3-agent in OpenStack Neutron incorrectly applies SNAT rules to IPv6 subnets, which causes an error when iptables-restore is used due to an invalid mask specification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of IPv6 prefixes when applying SNAT rules",
      "Lack of input validation when creating network rules"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) by breaking the L3-agent, which prevents further floating IPv4 addresses from being attached. Additionally, the faulty network cannot be removed via the API and requires manual database cleanup.",
    "attack_vector": "An authenticated user can create an IPv6 private subnet attached to an L3 router.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment. The attacker needs the capability to create and manage network resources such as subnets and routers.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "OpenStack Neutron versions up to 2013.2.3",
      "OpenStack Neutron version 2014.1"
