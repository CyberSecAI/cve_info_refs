Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4941:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `proxy.php` file of the "Cross Rss" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `rss` parameter in the `proxy.php` file is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize or validate the `rss` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** By manipulating the `rss` parameter, an attacker can read sensitive files on the server. The example given is `http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/cross-rss/proxy.php?rss=/etc/passwd`, which would allow an attacker to view the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file, potentially revealing usernames, and other system information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL that includes the `rss` parameter with the path of the file to be accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, meaning anyone can attempt to access the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `proxy.php` and the `rss` parameter to exploit it.

**Additional Details**

*   The affected version of the plugin is confirmed to be 1.7 and likely includes earlier versions.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 29, 2014.
*   There is no known fix for this vulnerability.
