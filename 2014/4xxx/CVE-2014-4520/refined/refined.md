Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-4520

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `plugin_dir` parameter in the `phprack.php` file of the DMCA WaterMarker plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `plugin_dir` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is then executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Malicious scripts can steal cookies, leading to session hijacking.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker might modify content on the site.
*   **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users could be redirected to malicious websites.
*   **Other malicious activities:** The attacker can perform any action that a user is capable of doing on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `phprack.php` file, with the malicious payload embedded in the `plugin_dir` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the affected server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable code was present in versions prior to 1.1 of the DMCA WaterMarker plugin.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1 by removing the vulnerable `racktest` functionality. The files `phpRack`, `phprack.php`, and `rack-tests` were deleted, and the `racktest_run()` function and related code was removed from `dmca-wm.php`.
* The provided PoC (`http://locahost/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/dmcaâwatermarker/phprack.php?plugin_dir=plugin_dir%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E`) demonstrates the injection of a simple JavaScript alert, proving the XSS vulnerability.
