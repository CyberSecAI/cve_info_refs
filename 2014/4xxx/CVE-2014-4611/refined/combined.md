slab: fix oops when reading /proc/slab\_allocators
commit 03787301420376ae41fbaf4267f4a6253d152ac5 upstream.
Commit b1cb0982bdd6 ("change the management method of free objects of
the slab") introduced a bug on slab leak detector
('/proc/slab\_allocators'). This detector works like as following
decription.
1. traverse all objects on all the slabs.
2. determine whether it is active or not.
3. if active, print who allocate this object.
but that commit changed the way how to manage free objects, so the logic
determining whether it is active or not is also changed. In before, we
regard object in cpu caches as inactive one, but, with this commit, we
mistakenly regard object in cpu caches as active one.
This intoduces kernel oops if DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC is enabled. If
DEBUG\_PAGEALLOC is enabled, kernel\_map\_pages() is used to detect who
corrupt free memory in the slab. It unmaps page table mapping if object
is free and map it if object is active. When slab leak detector check
object in cpu caches, it mistakenly think this object active so try to
access object memory to retrieve caller of allocation. At this point,
page table mapping to this object doesn't exist, so oops occurs.
Following is oops message reported from Dave.
It blew up when something tried to read /proc/slab\_allocators
(Just cat it, and you should see the oops below)

To fix the problem, I introduce an object status buffer on each slab.
With this, we can track object status precisely, so slab leak detector
would not access active object and no kernel oops would occur. Memory
overhead caused by this fix is only imposed to CONFIG\_DEBUG\_SLAB\_LEAK
which is mainly used for debugging, so memory overhead isn't big
problem.

ALSA: control: Make sure that id->index does not overflow
commit 883a1d49f0d77d30012f114b2e19fc141beb3e8e upstream.
The ALSA control code expects that the range of assigned indices to a control is
continuous and does not overflow. Currently there are no checks to enforce this.
If a control with a overflowing index range is created that control becomes
effectively inaccessible and unremovable since snd\_ctl\_find\_id() will not be
able to find it. This patch adds a check that makes sure that controls with a
overflowing index range can not be created.

ALSA: control: Handle numid overflow
commit ac902c112d90a89e59916f751c2745f4dbdbb4bd upstream.
Each control gets automatically assigned its numids when the control is created.
The allocation is done by incrementing the numid by the amount of allocated
numids per allocation. This means that excessive creation and destruction of
controls (e.g. via SNDRV\_CTL\_IOCTL\_ELEM\_ADD/REMOVE) can cause the id to
eventually overflow. Currently when this happens for the control that caused the
overflow kctl->id.numid + kctl->count will also over flow causing it to be
smaller than kctl->id.numid. Most of the code assumes that this is something
that can not happen, so we need to make sure that it won't happen

ALSA: control: Fix replacing user controls
commit 82262a46627bebb0febcc26664746c25cef08563 upstream.
There are two issues with the current implementation for replacing user
controls. The first is that the code does not check if the control is actually a
user control and neither does it check if the control is owned by the process
that tries to remove it. That allows userspace applications to remove arbitrary
controls, which can cause a user after free if a for example a driver does not
expect a control to be removed from under its feed.
The second issue is that on one hand when a control is replaced the
user\_ctl\_count limit is not checked and on the other hand the user\_ctl\_count is
increased (even though the number of user controls does not change). This allows
userspace, once the user\_ctl\_count limit as been reached, to repeatedly replace
a control until user\_ctl\_count overflows. Once that happens new controls can be
added effectively bypassing the user\_ctl\_count limit.
Both issues can be fixed by instead of open-coding the removal of the control
that is to be replaced to use snd\_ctl\_remove\_user\_ctl(). This function does
proper permission checks as well as decrements user\_ctl\_count after the control
has been removed.
Note that by using snd\_ctl\_remove\_user\_ctl() the check which returns -EBUSY at
beginning of the function if the control already exists is removed. This is not
a problem though since the check is quite useless, because the lock that is
protecting the control list is released between the check and before adding the
new control to the list, which means that it is possible that a different
control with the same settings is added to the list after the check. Luckily
there is another check that is done while holding the lock in snd\_ctl\_add(), so
we'll rely on that to make sure that the same control is not added twice.

ALSA: control: Protect user controls against concurrent access
commit 07f4d9d74a04aa7c72c5dae0ef97565f28f17b92 upstream.
The user-control put and get handlers as well as the tlv do not protect against
concurrent access from multiple threads. Since the state of the control is not
updated atomically it is possible that either two write operations or a write
and a read operation race against each other. Both can lead to arbitrary memory
disclosure. This patch introduces a new lock that protects user-controls from
concurrent access. Since applications typically access controls sequentially
than in parallel a single lock per card should be fine.

ALSA: hda - verify pin:converter connection on unsol event for HSW and VLV
commit b4f75aea553a2146bbdd159c397a2ac42cbb9902 upstream.
This patch will verify the pin's coverter selection for an active stream
when an unsol event reports this pin becomes available again after a display
mode change or hot-plug event.
For Haswell+ and Valleyview: display mode change or hot-plug can change the
transcoder:port connection and make all the involved audio pins share the 1st
converter. So the stream using 1st convertor will flow to multiple pins
but active streams using other converters will fail. This workaround
is to assure the pin selects the right conveter and an assigned converter is
not shared by other unused pins.

Drivers: hv: balloon: Ensure pressure reports are posted regularly
commit ae339336dc950b9b05e7ccd3565dd3e8781c06d9 upstream.
The current code posts periodic memory pressure status from a dedicated thread.
Under some conditions, especially when we are releasing a lot of memory into
the guest, we may not send timely pressure reports back to the host. Fix this
issue by reporting pressure in all contexts that can be active in this driver.

USB: cdc-acm: fix broken runtime suspend
commit 140cb81ac8c625942a1d695875932c615767a526 upstream.
The current ACM runtime-suspend implementation is broken in several
ways:
Firstly, it buffers only the first write request being made while
suspended -- any further writes are silently dropped.
Secondly, writes being dropped also leak write urbs, which are never
reclaimed (until the device is unbound).
Thirdly, even the single buffered write is not cleared at shutdown
(which may happen before the device is resumed), something which can
lead to another urb leak as well as a PM usage-counter leak.
Fix this by implementing a delayed-write queue using urb anchors and
making sure to discard the queue properly at shutdown.

Fix race between write() and resume() due to improper locking that could
lead to writes being reordered.
Resume must be done atomically and susp\_count be protected by the
write\_lock in order to prevent racing with write(). This could otherwise
lead to writes being reordered if write() grabs the write\_lock after
susp\_count is decremented, but before the delayed urb is submitted.

MIPS: KVM: Allocate at least 16KB for exception handlers
commit 7006e2dfda9adfa40251093604db76d7e44263b3 upstream.
Each MIPS KVM guest has its own copy of the KVM exception vector. This
contains the TLB refill exception handler at offset 0x000, the general
exception handler at offset 0x180, and interrupt exception handlers at
offset 0x200 in case Cause\_IV=1. A common handler is copied to offset
0x2000 and offset 0x3000 is used for temporarily storing k1 during entry
from guest.
However the amount of memory allocated for this purpose is calculated as
0x200 rounded up to the next page boundary, which is insufficient if 4KB
pages are in use. This can lead to the common handler at offset 0x2000
being overwritten and infinitely recursive exceptions on the next exit
from the guest.
Increase the minimum size from 0x200 to 0x4000 to cover the full use of
the page.

KVM: lapic: sync highest ISR to hardware apic on EOI
commit fc57ac2c9ca8109ea97fcc594f4be436944230cc upstream.
When Hyper-V enlightenments are in effect, Windows prefers to issue an
Hyper-V MSR write to issue an EOI rather than an x2apic MSR write.
The Hyper-V MSR write is not handled by the processor, and besides
being slower, this also causes bugs with APIC virtualization. The
reason is that on EOI the processor will modify the highest in-service
interrupt (SVI) field of the VMCS, as explained in section 29.1.4 of
the SDM; every other step in EOI virtualization is already done by
apic\_send\_eoi or on VM entry, but this one is missing.
We need to do the same, and be careful not to muck with the isr\_count
and highest\_isr\_cache fields that are unused when virtual interrupt
delivery is enabled.

Its too easy to add thousand of UDP sockets on a particular bucket,

Early demux is supposed to be an optimization, we should avoid spending
too much time in it.
It is interesting to note \_\_udp4\_lib\_demux\_lookup() only tries to
match first socket in the chain.
10 is the threshold we already have in \_\_udp4\_lib\_lookup() to switch

vxlan: use dev->needed\_headroom instead of dev->hard\_header\_len
[ Upstream commit 2853af6a2ea1a8ed09b09dd4fb578e7f435e8d34 ]
When we mirror packets from a vxlan tunnel to other device,
the mirror device should see the same packets (that is, without
outer header). Because vxlan tunnel sets dev->hard\_header\_len,
tcf\_mirred() resets mac header back to outer mac, the mirror device
actually sees packets with outer headers
Vxlan tunnel should set dev->needed\_headroom instead of
dev->hard\_header\_len, like what other ip tunnels do. This fixes
the above problem.

rtnetlink: fix userspace API breakage for iproute2 < v3.9.0
[ Upstream commit e5eca6d41f53db48edd8cf88a3f59d2c30227f8e ]
When running RHEL6 userspace on a current upstream kernel, "ip link"
fails to show VF information.
The reason is a kernel<->userspace API change introduced by commit
88c5b5ce5cb57 ("rtnetlink: Call nlmsg\_parse() with correct header length"),
after which the kernel does not see iproute2's IFLA\_EXT\_MASK attribute
in the netlink request.
iproute2 adjusted for the API change in its commit 63338dca4513
("libnetlink: Use ifinfomsg instead of rtgenmsg in rtnl\_wilddump\_req\_filter").
The problem has been noticed before:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-netdev&m=136692296022182&w=2
(Subject: Re: getting VF link info seems to be broken in 3.9-rc8)
We can do better than tell those with old userspace to upgrade. We can
recognize the old iproute2 in the kernel by checking the netlink message
length. Even when including the IFLA\_EXT\_MASK attribute, its netlink
message is shorter than struct ifinfomsg.
With this patch "ip link" shows VF information in both old and new
iproute2 versions.

sctp: Fix sk\_ack\_backlog wrap-around problem
[ Upstream commit d3217b15a19a4779c39b212358a5c71d725822ee ]
Consider the scenario:
For a TCP-style socket, while processing the COOKIE\_ECHO chunk in
sctp\_sf\_do\_5\_1D\_ce(), after it has passed a series of sanity check,
a new association would be created in sctp\_unpack\_cookie(), but afterwards,
some processing maybe failed, and sctp\_association\_free() will be called to
free the previously allocated association, in sctp\_association\_free(),
sk\_ack\_backlog value is decremented for this socket, since the initial
value for sk\_ack\_backlog is 0, after the decrement, it will be 65535,
a wrap-around problem happens, and if we want to establish new associations
afterward in the same socket, ABORT would be triggered since sctp deem the
accept queue as full.
Fix this issue by only decrementing sk\_ack\_backlog for associations in
the endpoint's list.

ipv4: fix a race in ip4\_datagram\_release\_cb()
[ Upstream commit 9709674e68646cee5a24e3000b3558d25412203a ]
Alexey gave a AddressSanitizer[1] report that finally gave a good hint
at where was the origin of various problems already reported by Dormando
in the past [2]
Problem comes from the fact that UDP can have a lockless TX path, and
concurrent threads can manipulate sk\_dst\_cache, while another thread,
is holding socket lock and calls \_\_sk\_dst\_set() in
ip4\_datagram\_release\_cb() (this was added in linux-3.8)
It seems that all we need to do is to use sk\_dst\_check() and
sk\_dst\_set() so that all the writers hold same spinlock
(sk->sk\_dst\_lock) to prevent corruptions.
TCP stack do not need this protection, as all sk\_dst\_cache writers hold
the socket lock.

sfc: PIO:Restrict to 64bit arch and use 64-bit writes.
[ Upstream commit daf37b556e437ec1ea1a597dcfeff338068380e1 ]
Fixes:ee45fd92c739
("sfc: Use TX PIO for sufficiently small packets")
The linux net driver uses memcpy\_toio() in order to copy into
the PIO buffers.
Even on a 64bit machine this causes 32bit accesses to a write-
combined memory region.
There are hardware limitations that mean that only 64bit
naturally aligned accesses are safe in all cases.
Due to being write-combined memory region two 32bit accesses
may be coalesced to form a 64bit non 64bit aligned access.
Solution was to open-code the memory copy routines using pointers
and to only enable PIO for x86\_64 machines.
Not tested on platforms other than x86\_64 because this patch
disables the PIO feature on other platforms.
Compile-tested on x86 to ensure that works.
The WARN\_ON\_ONCE() code in the previous version of this patch
has been moved into the internal sfc debug driver as the
assertion was unnecessary in the upstream kernel code.
This bug fix applies to v3.13 and v3.14 stable branches.

sh\_eth: use RNC mode for packet reception
[ Upstream commit 530aa2d0d9d55ab2775d47621ddf4b5b15bc1110 ]
The current behaviour of the sh\_eth driver is not to use the RNC bit
for the receive ring. This means that every packet recieved is not only
generating an IRQ but it also stops the receive ring DMA as well until
the driver re-enables it after unloading the packet.
This means that a number of the following errors are generated due to
the receive packet FIFO overflowing due to nowhere to put packets:
net eth0: Receive FIFO Overflow
Since feedback from Yoshihiro Shimoda shows that every supported LSI
for this driver should have the bit enabled it seems the best way is
to remove the RMCR default value from the per-system data and just
write it when initialising the RMCR value. This is discussed in
the message (http://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg284912.html).
I have tested the RMCR\_RNC configuration with NFS root filesystem and
the driver has not failed yet. There are further test reports from
Sergei Shtylov and others for both the R8A7790 and R8A7791.
There is also feedback fron Cao Minh Hiep[1] which reports the
same issue in (http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.linux.network/316285)
showing this fixes issues with losing UDP datagrams under iperf.

Commit efe4208 ("ipv6: make lookups simpler and faster") introduced a
regression in udp\_v6\_mcast\_next(), resulting in multicast packets not
reaching the destination sockets under certain conditions.
The packet's IPv6 addresses are wrongly compared to the IPv6 addresses
from the function's socket argument, which indicates the starting point
for looping, instead of the loop variable. If the addresses from the
first socket do not match the packet's addresses, no socket in the list
will match.

The reason for the oops is that IMA-appraisal uses "kernel\_read()" when
file is closed. kernel\_read() honors LSM security hook which calls
Apparmor handler, which uses current->nsproxy->mnt\_ns. The 'guilty'
commit changed the order of cleanup code so that nsproxy->mnt\_ns was
not already available for Apparmor.
Discussion about the issue with Al Viro and Eric W. Biederman suggested
that kernel\_read() is too high-level for IMA. Another issue, except
security checking, that was identified is mandatory locking. kernel\_read
honors it as well and it might prevent IMA from calculating necessary hash.
It was suggested to use simplified version of the function without security
and locking checks.
This patch introduces special version ima\_kernel\_read(), which skips security
and mandatory locking checking. It prevents the kernel oops to happen.

ima: audit log files opened with O\_DIRECT flag
commit f9b2a735bdddf836214b5dca74f6ca7712e5a08c upstream.
Files are measured or appraised based on the IMA policy. When a
file, in policy, is opened with the O\_DIRECT flag, a deadlock
occurs.
The first attempt at resolving this lockdep temporarily removed the
O\_DIRECT flag and restored it, after calculating the hash. The
second attempt introduced the O\_DIRECT\_HAVELOCK flag. Based on this
flag, do\_blockdev\_direct\_IO() would skip taking the i\_mutex a second
time. The third attempt, by Dmitry Kasatkin, resolves the i\_mutex
locking issue, by re-introducing the IMA mutex, but uncovered
another problem. Reading a file with O\_DIRECT flag set, writes
directly to userspace pages. A second patch allocates a user-space
like memory. This works for all IMA hooks, except ima\_file\_free(),
which is called on \_\_fput() to recalculate the file hash.
Until this last issue is addressed, do not 'collect' the
measurement for measuring, appraising, or auditing files opened
with the O\_DIRECT flag set. Based on policy, permit or deny file
access. This patch defines a new IMA policy rule option named

iscsi-target: Reject mutual authentication with reflected CHAP\_C
commit 1d2b60a5545942b1376cb48c1d55843d71e3a08f upstream.
This patch adds an explicit check in chap\_server\_compute\_md5() to ensure
the CHAP\_C value received from the initiator during mutual authentication
does not match the original CHAP\_C provided by the target.
This is in line with RFC-3720, section 8.2.1:
Originators MUST NOT reuse the CHAP challenge sent by the Responder
for the other direction of a bidirectional authentication.
Responders MUST check for this condition and close the iSCSI TCP
connection if it occurs.

target: Fix NULL pointer dereference for XCOPY in target\_put\_sess\_cmd
commit 0ed6e189e3f6ac3a25383ed5cc8b0ac24c9b97b7 upstream.
This patch fixes a NULL pointer dereference regression bug that was
introduced with:
commit 1e1110c43b1cda9fe77fc4a04835e460550e6b3c
Author: Mikulas Patocka
Date: Sat May 17 06:49:22 2014 -0400
target: fix memory leak on XCOPY
Now that target\_put\_sess\_cmd() -> kref\_put\_spinlock\_irqsave() is
called with a valid se\_cmd->cmd\_kref, a NULL pointer dereference
is triggered because the XCOPY passthrough commands don't have
an associated se\_session pointer.
To address this bug, go ahead and checking for a NULL se\_sess pointer
within target\_put\_sess\_cmd(), and call se\_cmd->se\_tfo->release\_cmd()
to release the XCOPY's xcopy\_pt\_cmd memory.

commit 563d5546698587b95b3a1cdbfd0d92e250e9b6f5
Author: Boris BREZILLON
Date: Fri Jun 6 14:36:09 2014 -0700
rtc: rtc-at91rm9200: fix infinite wait for ACKUPD irq
commit 2fe121e1f5aa3bf31b418a9790db6c400e922291 upstream.
The rtc user must wait at least 1 sec between each time/calandar update
(see atmel's datasheet chapter "Updating Time/Calendar").
Use the 1Hz interrupt to update the at91\_rtc\_upd\_rdy flag and wait for
the at91\_rtc\_wait\_upd\_rdy event if the rtc is not ready.
This patch fixes a deadlock in an uninterruptible wait when the RTC is
updated more than once every second. AFAICT the bug is here from the
beginning, but I think we should at least backport this fix to 3.10 and
the following longterm and stable releases.

lz4: ensure length does not wrap

```
Given some pathologically compressed data, lz4 could possibly decide to
wrap a few internal variables, causing unknown things to happen.  Catch
this before the wrapping happens and abort the decompression.

Report ID: LMS-2014-06-16-5

CVE ID: CVE-2014-4611

Researcher Name: Don A. Bailey
Researcher Organization: Lab Mouse Security
Researcher Email: donb at securitymouse.com
Researcher Website: www.securitymouse.com

Vulnerability Status: Patched
Vulnerability Embargo: Broken

Vulnerability Class: Integer Overflow
Vulnerability Effect: Memory Corruption
Vulnerability Impact: DoS, RCE
Vulnerability DoS Practicality: Practical
Vulnerability RCE Practicality: Practical
Vulnerability Criticality: High

Vulnerability Scope:
All versions of the Linux kernel (3x/2x) with LZ4 support (lib/lz4).

Functions Affected:
	lib/lz4/lz4_decompress.c:lz4_uncompress

Criticality Reasoning
---------------------
Due to the design of the algorithm, an attacker can specify any desired
offset to a write pointer. The attacker can instrument the write in such
a way as to only write four bytes at a specified offset. Subsequent code
will allow the attacker to escape from the decompression algorithm without
further memory corruption. This may allow the attacker to overwrite
critical structures in memory that affect flow of execution.

Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
An integer overflow can occur when processing any variant of a "literal run"
in the lz4_uncompress function.

Vulnerability Resolution
------------------------
The Linux kernel team has resolved this vulnerability.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1112436#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2014-06-24 00:22:34 UTC  ``` Don A. Bailey of Lab Mouse Security reported an integer overflow issue in various implementations of LZO (Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer) and LZ4 compression algorithms.  The issue is in the handling of "literal runs" during decompression, and can lead to application crash and, possibly, code execution.  This bug is for LZ4 and LZ4 copy embedded in the Linux kernel (as of version 3.11).  This issue can not be triggered on 64bit systems today, as it would require input of the size that is beyond capabilities of modern computers.  On 32bit systems, this can only affect applications using sufficiently large decompression blocks (16mb+).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1112436#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-06-27 06:06:23 UTC  ```  Created lz4 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1113869](show_bug.cgi?id=1113869 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2014-4611 LZ4: LZ4_decompress_generic() integer overflow [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 1113870](show_bug.cgi?id=1113870 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2014-4611 LZ4: LZ4_decompress_generic() integer overflow [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1112436#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-06-27 06:06:43 UTC  ``` This issue is public:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q2/669>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1112436#c3)  Petr Matousek    2014-06-27 07:00:22 UTC  ```  Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1113884](show_bug.cgi?id=1113884 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-4611 kernel: LZ4: LZ4_decompress_generic() integer overflow [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1112436#c4)  Petr Matousek    2014-06-27 07:13:37 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue does not affect the kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux MRG 2.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1112436#c5)  Josh Boyer    2014-06-27 11:45:22 UTC  ``` I believe this is fixed upstream with:  <https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=206204a1162b995e2185275167b22468c00d6b36>  Which has been backported to the stable kernels with commits:  3.14.y: 5f32449c2863adf190b83402e9a4069cee054f9d 3.15.y: 80fdb886fefbc782195ed2c0bd757ea202e05953   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1112436#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-06-30 14:35:11 UTC  ``` Blog posts from Don A.

Continuation of my previous PR, which accidentally had all changes in master and the PR targeted master. I'm not spectacular with git, but I think this PR is correct. If I did something wrong or you simply dislike the feature branch, you can just copy the lz4cli.c file out and add it to your local, then push; it's the only file changed.

Added support for multiple input files to act more like other compressors. For example: gzip file1 file2 file3. You can now do: lz4 [args] -m file1 file2 file3. Fixes 151.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I'm surprised that this line of code works :  `char *input_filenames[argc];`  argc is not a constant, so it looks like a kind of "dynamic size allocation on stack" . I suspect that Visual will not like it. Let's find out.... |

| Quick question about error case behavior :  Let's suppose we want to compress a list of 6 filenames. In the middle of the list, say name 3, compression fails (typically because the file does not exist or is not valid). How should the program behave ? => Exit immediatly with an error code ? => Proceed with the rest of list, trying to compress as much valid files as possible ? |

| [@Cyan4973](https://github.com/Cyan4973), it's C99 feature "VLA" (Variable Length Array). Since our `CFLAGS` has `-std=c99`, it's strictly valid code. But VLA has some problems :   * As you suppose, VC++ and old C89 compilers could not compile it. * VLA becomes optional feature in C11 and greater (see [`__STDC_NO_VLA__`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_%28C_standard_revision%29#Optional_features)). 😧   If we will support C89 compilers, [intermingled declarations](https://github.com/KyleJHarper/lz4/commit/fa27d236b4f3fc9938478e4464b63953d6429d4b#diff-638ed824ff46570e8635f871191331edR291) also should be removed.  How should the program behave ?  Since this PR's intention is mimicing gzip, gzip-like behaviour will be expected. In this case, latter is more "gzip-like" behaviour. The following log is my experiment :  ``` # Initial state $ ls -1 lz4.1 lz4c.1 lz4cat.1  # Normal compression $ gzip -k lz4.1 lz4c.1 lz4cat.1 $ ls -1 lz4.1 lz4.1.gz lz4c.1 lz4c.1.gz lz4cat.1 lz4cat.1.gz  $ rm *.gz  # Compression with errors $ gzip -k lz4.1 dummy1 lz4c.1 dummy2 lz4cat.1 dummy3 gzip: dummy1: No such file or directory gzip: dummy2: No such file or directory gzip: dummy3: No such file or directory $ ls -1 lz4.1 lz4.1.gz lz4c.1 lz4c.1.gz lz4cat.1 lz4cat.1.gz  ``` |

# LZ4 - Extremely fast compression

LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm,
providing compression speed > 500 MB/s per core,
scalable with multi-cores CPU.
It features an extremely fast decoder,
with speed in multiple GB/s per core,
typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems.

Speed can be tuned dynamically, selecting an "acceleration" factor
which trades compression ratio for faster speed.
On the other end, a high compression derivative, LZ4\_HC, is also provided,
trading CPU time for improved compression ratio.
All versions feature the same decompression speed.

LZ4 is also compatible with [dictionary compression](https://github.com/facebook/zstd#the-case-for-small-data-compression),
both at [API](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/v1.8.3/lib/lz4frame.h#L481) and [CLI](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/blob/v1.8.3/programs/lz4.1.md#operation-modifiers) levels.
It can ingest any input file as dictionary, though only the final 64KB are used.
This capability can be combined with the [Zstandard Dictionary Builder](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/v1.3.5/programs/zstd.1.md#dictionary-builder),
in order to drastically improve compression performance on small files.

LZ4 library is provided as open-source software using BSD 2-Clause license.

## Benchmarks

The benchmark uses [lzbench](https://github.com/inikep/lzbench), from @inikep
compiled with GCC v8.2.0 on Linux 64-bits (Ubuntu 4.18.0-17).
The reference system uses a Core i7-9700K CPU @ 4.9GHz (w/ turbo boost).
Benchmark evaluates the compression of reference [Silesia Corpus](http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/~sdeor/index.php?page=silesia)
in single-thread mode.

LZ4 is also compatible and optimized for x32 mode (`-mx32`),
for which it provides additional speed performance.

## Installation

```
make
make install     # this command may require root permissions

```

LZ4's `Makefile` supports standard [Makefile conventions](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html),
including [staged installs](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html), [redirection](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html), or [command redefinition](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Utilities-in-Makefiles.html).
It is compatible with parallel builds (`-j#`).

### Building LZ4 - Using vcpkg

You can download and install LZ4 using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg
./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
./vcpkg integrate install
./vcpkg.exe install lz4

```

The LZ4 port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please [create an issue or pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

## Documentation

The raw LZ4 block compression format is detailed within [lz4\_Block\_format](/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Block_format.md).

Arbitrarily long files or data streams are compressed using multiple blocks,
for streaming requirements. These blocks are organized into a frame,
defined into [lz4\_Frame\_format](/lz4/lz4/blob/dev/doc/lz4_Frame_format.md).
Interoperable versions of LZ4 must also respect the frame format.

## Other source versions

Beyond the C reference source,
many contributors have created versions of lz4 in multiple languages
(Java, C#, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.).
A list of known source ports is maintained on the [LZ4 Homepage](http://www.lz4.org).

### Packaging status

Most distributions are bundled with a package manager
which allows easy installation of both the `liblz4` library
and the `lz4` command line interface.

### Raising Lazarus - The 20 Year Old Bug that Went to Mars

### Twenty Years Old

|  |
| --- |
| Mars Curiosity Rover |

It's rare that you come across a bug so subtle that it can last for two decades. But, that's exactly what has happened with the Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer (LZO) algorithm. Initially written in 1994, Markus [Oberhumer](http://www.oberhumer.com/) designed a sophisticated and extremely efficient compression algorithm so elegant and well architected that it outperforms zlib and bzip by four or five times their decompression speed.

As a result, Markus has made a successful and well deserved career out of optimizing code for various platforms. I was impressed to find out that his LZO algorithm has gone to the planet Mars on NASA devices multiple times! Most recently, LZO has touched down on the red planet within the [Mars Curiosity Rover](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/), which just celebrated its first [martian anniversary](http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/24/tech/mars-curiosity-anniversary/) on Tuesday.

Because of the speed and efficiency of the algorithm, LZO has made its way into both proprietary and open source projects world-wide. It's has lived in automotive systems, airplanes, and other embedded systems for over a decade. The algorithm has even made its way into projects we use on a daily basis, such as [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/), [MPlayer2](http://www.mplayer2.org/), [Libav](http://libav.org/), [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), the [Linux kernel](http://kernel.org/), [Juniper Junos](http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=KB26545), and much, much, more.

In the past few years, LZO has gained traction in file systems as well. LZO can be used in the Linux kernel within btrfs, squashfs, jffs2, and ubifs. A recent variant of the algorithm, [LZ4](https://code.google.com/p/lz4/), is used for compression in ZFS for Solaris, Illumos, and FreeBSD.

LZO is even enabled in kernels for Samsung Android devices to increase kernel loading speed and improve the user experience, as noted in the [Android Hacker's Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Android-Hackers-Handbook-Joshua-Drake/dp/111860864X).

With its popularity increasing, Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer has been rewritten by many engineering firms for both closed and open systems. These rewrites, however, have always been based on Oberhumer's core open source implementation. As a result, they all inherited a subtle [integer overflow](http://phrack.org/issues/60/10.html). Even LZ4 has the same exact bug, but changed very slightly.

### Engineered Genetics

[Code reuse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse#Systematic_software_reuse) is a normal part of engineering, and is something we do every day. But, it can be dangerous. By reusing code that is known to work well, especially in highly optimized algorithms, projects can become subject to vulnerabilities in what is perceived as trusted code. Auditing highly optimized algorithms is a fragile endeavor. It is very easy to break these types of algorithms. Therefore, reused code that is highly specialized is often presumed safe because of its age, its proven efficiency, and its fragility.

This creates a sort of digital DNA, a digital genetic footprint that can be traced over time. Though there are certainly many instances of proprietary variants of LZO and LZ4, the following six implementations are available in open source software

* [Oberhumer LZO (core/reference open source implementation)](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/#download)
* [Linux kernel's LZO implementation](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/lib/lzo/)
* [Libav's LZO implementation](http://libav.org/)
* [FFmpeg's LZO implementation](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
* [Linux kernel's LZ4 implementation](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/lib/lz4/)
* [LZ4 core/reference implementation](https://code.google.com/p/lz4/)

Let's take a look at a version of the algorithm that is easy to read online, the Linux kernel implementation found [here](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/lib/lzo/lzo1x_decompress_safe.c?v=3.14).

In all variants of LZ[O4], the vulnerability occurs when processing a Literal Run. This is a chunk of compressed data that isn't compressed at all. Literals are uncompressed bytes that the user decided, for whatever reason, should not be compressed. A Literal Run is signaled by a state machine in LZO, and by a Mask in LZ4.

 56                         if (likely(state == 0)) {

 57                                 if (unlikely(t == 0)) {

 58                                         while (unlikely(\*ip == 0)) {

 59                                                 t += 255;

 60                                                 ip++;

 61                                                 NEED\_IP(1);

 62                                         }

 63                                         t += 15 + \*ip++;

 64                                 }

 65                                 t += 3;

In the above sample, the integer overflow is evident. The variable 't' is incremented by 255 every time the compression payload contains a nil byte (0x00) when a Literal Run is detected. Regardless of whether the variable 't' is signed or unsigned, 255 will be added to it. The only check is to ensure that the input buffer contains another byte. This means that 't' can accumulate until it is a very large unsigned integer. If 't' is a 32bit integer, it only takes approximately sixteen (16) megabytes of zeroes to generate a sufficiently large value for 't'. Though 't' can overflow here, this is not where the attack occurs. There is another more important overflow just below this chunk of code.

66 copy\_literal\_run:

67 #if defined(CONFIG\_HAVE\_EFFICIENT\_UNALIGNED\_ACCESS)

68                                 if (likely(HAVE\_IP(t + 15) && HAVE\_OP(t + 15))) {

69                                         const unsigned char \*ie = ip + t;

70                                         unsigned char \*oe = op + t;

71                                         do {

72                                                 COPY8(op, ip);

73                                                 op += 8;

74                                                 ip += 8;

75                                                 COPY8(op, ip);

76                                                 op += 8;

77                                                 ip += 8;

78                                         } while (ip < ie);

79                                         ip = ie;

80                                         op = oe;

81                                 } else

82 #endif

Above, we see the "copy\_literal\_run" chunk of code. This is the section of the LZO algorithm that uses the variable 't' as a size parameter. On line 68, the code ensures that the input buffer (IP) and output buffer (OP) are large enough to contain 't' bytes. However, in the Linux kernel implementation, they pad by 15 bytes to ensure the 16 byte copy does not overflow either buffer. This is where things fail.

The macros HAVE\_IP and HAVE\_OP validate that 't' bytes are available in the respective buffer. But, before the macro is called, the expression (t + 15) is evaluated. If the value of 't' is large enough, this expression will cause an integer overflow. The attacker can make this expression result in a value of zero (0) through fourteen (14) by forcing 't' to equal the values -15 to -1, respectively. This means that the HAVE macros will always believe that enough space is available in both input and output buffers.

On line 70, the pointer 'oe' will now point to before the 'op' buffer, potentially pointing to memory prior to the start of the output buffer. The subsequent code will copy sixteen (16) bytes from the input pointer to the output pointer, which does nothing as these pointers should point to a "safe" location in memory. However, there are two side effects here that the attacker must abuse: lines 78 and 80.

Because 'ie' will always have an address lower in memory than 'ip', the loop is immediately broken after the first sixteen (16) byte copy. This means that the value 't' did not cause a crash in the copy loop, making this copy essentially a no-op from the attacker's point of view. Most importantly, on line 80 (and 79), the buffer pointer is set to the overflown pointer. This means that now, the output pointer points to memory outside of the bounds of the output buffer. The attacker now has the capability to corrupt memory, or at least cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by writing to an invalid memory page.

### The Impact of Raising Dead Code

Each variant of the LZO and LZ4 implementation is vulnerable in slightly different ways. The attacker must construct a malicious payload to fit each particular implementation. One payload cannot be used to trigger more than a DoS on each implementation. Because of the slightly different overflow requirements, state machine subtleties, and overflow checks that must be bypassed, even a worldwide DoS is not a simple task.

This results in completely different threats depending on the implementation of the algorithm, the underlying architecture, and the memory layout of the target application. Remote Code Execution (RCE) is possible on multiple architectures and platforms, but absolutely not all. Denial of Service is possible on most implementations, but not all. Adjacent Object Over-Write (OOW) is possible on many architectures.

| Lazarus raised from the dead |

Because the LZO algorithm is considered a library function, each specific implementation must be evaluated for risk, **regardless of whether the algorithm used has been patched**. Why? We are talking about code that has existed in the wild for two decades. The scope of this algorithm touches everything from embedded microcontrollers on the Mars Rover, mainframe operating systems, modern day desktops, and mobile phones. Engineers that have used LZO must evaluate the use case to identify whether or not the implementation is vulnerable, and in what format.

Here is a list of impact based on each **library**. Implementations, or use cases of each library may change the threat model enough to warrant reclassification. So, please have a variant audited by a skilled third party, such as <[shameless plug](https://www.securitymouse.com/contact)>.

For a bug report on each implementation, please visit the Lab Mouse Security's [vulnerability](https://www.securitymouse.com/vulnerability) site.

### How Do You Know If You're Vulnerable

#### Projects Using LZO/LZ4

The easiest way to identify whether your specific implementation is vulnerable is to determine the maximum chunk size that is passed to the decompress routine. If buffers of sixteen (16) megabytes or more can be passed to the LZO or LZ4 decompress routine in one call, then exploitation of the integer overflow is possible. For example, ZFS constrains buffer sizes to 128k. So, even though they use a vulnerable implementation of LZ4, an attack is not possible without a second bug to bypass the buffer size constraint.

The second easiest way is to identify the bit size of the count variable. If the count variable (for example, named 't' in the Linux kernel code shown above) is 64bit, it would take such a massive amount of data to trigger the overflow that the attack would likely be infeasible, regardless of how much data can be passed to the vulnerable function in one call. This is due to the fact that even modern computers do not have enough RAM available to store the data required to implement such an attack.

However, there is a specific issue with the previous check. Validate that even if the count variable is 64bit in size, the value used is still 64bit when a length value is checked. If the actual length value is truncated to 32bits, the attack will still work with only sixteen (16) megabytes of data.

#### Users

All users of FFmpeg, Libav, and projects that depend on them, should consider themselves at risk to remote code execution. Period. Please update your software from the FFmpeg and Libav websites, or refrain from using these applications until your distribution has an adequate patch.

It should be noted that certain Linux distributions package Mplayer2 with the base system by default. MPlayer2 is vulnerable to RCE "out of the box". If your distribution packages MPlayer2 by default, be sure to disable the embedded media player plugin (gecko-mediaplayer) for your browser. Firefox/Iceweasel, Chromium, Opera, Konqueror, and other Linux-based browsers are vulnerable to RCE regardless of the platform/architecture when an MPlayer2 plugin is enabled.

### Vendor Status

Lab Mouse has reached out to and worked with each vendor of the vulnerable algorithm. As of today, June 26th, 2014, all LZO vendors have patches either available online, or will later today. Please update as soon as possible to minimize the existing threat surface.

In the near future, Lab Mouse will publish a more technical blog on why and how RCE is possible using this bug. We consider that information to be imperative for both auditors and engineers, as it assists in identifying, classifying, and prioritizing a threat. However, that report will be released once the patches have been widely distributed for a sufficient amount of time.

For more information, please visit our [contact](https://www.securitymouse.com/contact) page. We are more than happy to help your team with their use case, or implementation of these algorithms.

### Summary

Overall, this is how this bug release breaks down.

* Vendors have patches ready or released
* Distributions have been notified
* Vendors of proprietary variants have been notified (where they could be found)
* All bug reports can be found [here](https://www.securitymouse.com/vulnerability)
* RCE is not only possible but *practical* on all Libav/FFmpeg based projects
* All others are likely impractical to RCE, but still possible given a sufficiently skilled attacker

It is always exciting to uncover a vulnerability as subtle as this issue, especially one that has persisted and propagated for two decades. But, it makes me pause and consider the way we look at engineering as a model.

Speed and efficiency are imperatives for modern projects. We're building technology that touches our lives like never before. I know that most engineers strive to build not only elegant, but safe code. But, we still see security as a disparate discipline from engineering. Security and engineering could not be more tightly bound. Without engineering, you can't provide security to users. Without security, engineering cannot provide a stable and provable platform.

Neil deGrasse Tyson famously claimed, [God is in the gaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytaf30wuLbQ). There is a similar issue in engineering. The individual often sees stability where the individual doesn't have expertise. Our God is the algorithm. We "bless" certain pieces of code because we don't have the time or knowledge to evaluate it. When we, as engineers and analysts, take that perspective, we are doing a disservice to the people that use our projects and services.

Often the best eyes are fresh or untrained eyes. The more we stop telling ourselves to step over the gaps in our code bases, the more holes we'll be able to fill. All it takes is one set of eyes to find a vulnerability, there is no level of expertise required to look and ask questions. Just look. Maybe you'll find the next 20 year old vulnerability.

   20 years ago, such defects were not considered threats because the code works as expected for all valid scenarios. I assume that you can hack the compressed stream in other ways and trigger other defects.
   The general statement should probably be that if you have code that's been written more than 15 years ago, it probably has multiple vulnerabilities by today's standards. Start reviewing...

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
