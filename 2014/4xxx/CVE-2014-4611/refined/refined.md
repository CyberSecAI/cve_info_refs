  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the LZ4 decompression algorithm when processing literal runs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow vulnerability due to unchecked increments to a length variable during decompression.",
      "Improper bounds checking when copying literal runs, which leads to out-of-bounds memory access.",
      "Use of an overflown length variable to calculate memory addresses."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory corruption, leading to potential denial of service (DoS) and remote code execution (RCE).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted malicious LZ4 compressed data that triggers the integer overflow during decompression.",
       "The attacker manipulates the compressed data to control the offset of a write operation."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted, malicious LZ4 compressed data stream to a vulnerable application or system. On 32-bit systems, this could occur by decompressing data blocks larger than 16MB. On 64-bit system it is impractical as it would require massive input data size beyond the capabilities of modern computers. However, if a 64-bit variable is truncated to 32-bit for length check before use, the vulnerability could still be triggered on 64 bit systems with less data."
