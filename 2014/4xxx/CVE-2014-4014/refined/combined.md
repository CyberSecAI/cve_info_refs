## Description

The capabilities implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.14.8 does not properly consider that namespaces are inapplicable to inodes, which allows local users to bypass intended chmod restrictions by first creating a user namespace, as demonstrated by setting the setgid bit on a file with group ownership of root.

fs,userns: Change inode\_capable to capable\_wrt\_inode\_uidgidThe kernel has no concept of capabilities with respect to inodes; inodes
exist independently of namespaces. For example, inode\_capable(inode,
CAP\_LINUX\_IMMUTABLE) would be nonsense.
This patch changes inode\_capable to check for uid and gid mappings and
renames it to capable\_wrt\_inode\_uidgid, which should make it more
obvious what it does.
Fixes CVE-2014-4014.

# Android Security Bulletin—December 2016

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published December 05, 2016 | Updated December 21, 2016*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Google devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of December 05, 2016 or later address all of
these issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on November 07,
2016 or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues are Critical security vulnerabilities in
device-specific code that could enable arbitrary code execution within the
context of the kernel, leading to the possibility of a local permanent device
compromise, which may require reflashing the operating system to repair the
device. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See
  [Common
  questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for additional information:
  + **2016-12-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-12-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2016-12-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2016-12-01
    and 2016-12-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the December
  05, 2016 security patch level.

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections, such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with
  [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2015_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2016-12-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2016-12-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2016-12-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2016-12-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-12-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2016-12-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the December 1, 2016 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of December 5, 2016 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2016-12-01](#2016-12-01-details) and
[2016-12-05](#2016-12-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9,
  Android One, Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

free\_msi\_irqs() is leaking memory, since list\_for\_each\_entry(entry,

target: Allow READ\_CAPACITY opcode in ALUA Standby access state
commit e7810c2d2c37fa8e58dda74b00790dab60fe6fba upstream.
This patch allows READ\_CAPACITY + SAI\_READ\_CAPACITY\_16 opcode
processing to occur while the associated ALUA group is in Standby
access state.
This is required to avoid host side LUN probe failures during the
initial scan if an ALUA group has already implicitly changed into
Standby access state.
This addresses a bug reported by Chris + Philip using dm-multipath
+ ESX hosts configured with ALUA multipath.

iser-target: Fix multi network portal shutdown regression
commit 2363d196686e44c0158929e7cf96c8589a24a81b upstream.
This patch fixes a iser-target specific regression introduced in
v3.15-rc6 with:
commit 14f4b54fe38f3a8f8392a50b951c8aa43b63687a
Author: Sagi Grimberg
Date: Tue Apr 29 13:13:47 2014 +0300
Target/iscsi,iser: Avoid accepting transport connections during stop stage
where the change to set iscsi\_np->enabled = false within
iscsit\_clear\_tpg\_np\_login\_thread() meant that a iscsi\_np with
two iscsi\_tpg\_np exports would have it's parent iscsi\_np set
to a disabled state, even if other iscsi\_tpg\_np exports still
existed.
This patch changes iscsit\_clear\_tpg\_np\_login\_thread() to only
set iscsi\_np->enabled = false when shutdown = true, and also
changes iscsit\_del\_np() to set iscsi\_np->enabled = true when
iscsi\_np->np\_exports is non zero.

commit dced9703a3b0972ba42eea27281a363bfb3d0c6f
Author: Sagi Grimberg

Target/iscsi,iser: Avoid accepting transport connections during stop stage
commit 14f4b54fe38f3a8f8392a50b951c8aa43b63687a upstream.
When the target is in stop stage, iSER transport initiates RDMA disconnects.
The iSER initiator may wish to establish a new connection over the
still existing network portal. In this case iSER transport should not
accept and resume new RDMA connections. In order to learn that, iscsi\_np
is added with enabled flag so the iSER transport can check when deciding
weather to accept and resume a new connection request.
The iscsi\_np is enabled after successful transport setup, and disabled
before iscsi\_np login threads are cleaned up.

netfilter: ipv4: defrag: set local\_df flag on defragmented skb
commit 895162b1101b3ea5db08ca6822ae9672717efec0 upstream.
else we may fail to forward skb even if original fragments do fit
outgoing link mtu:
1. remote sends 2k packets in two 1000 byte frags, DF set
2. we want to forward but only see '2k > mtu and DF set'
3. we then send icmp error saying that outgoing link is 1500
But original sender never sent a packet that would not fit
the outgoing link.
Setting local\_df makes outgoing path test size vs.
IPCB(skb)->frag\_max\_size, so we will still send the correct
error in case the largest original size did not fit
outgoing link mtu.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE-2014-4014: Linux kernel user namespace bug

The internal function inode_capable was used inappropriately.
Depending on configuration, this may be usable to escalate privileges.
A cursory inspection of my Fedora box suggests that it is not
vulnerable to the obvious way to exploit this bug.

The fix should appear in Linus' -master shortly, and it's tagged for
stable.  In the mean time, I've attached it here.

I'll follow up in a day or two with a description of the actual bug,
or one of you can try to beat me to it.
