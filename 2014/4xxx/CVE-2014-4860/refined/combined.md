## UEFI EDK2 Capsule Update vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#552286

Original Release Date: 2014-08-07 | Last Revised: 2015-10-22

---

### Overview

The EDK2 UEFI reference implementation contains multiple vulnerabilities in the Capsule Update mechanism.

### Description

| The open source EDK2 project provides a reference implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Researchers at The MITRE Corporation have discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the EDK2 Capsule Update mechanism. Commercial UEFI implementations may incorporate portions of the EDK2 source code, including the vulnerable Capsule Update code.  **Buffer overflow in Capsule Processing Phase** - CVE-2014-4859During the Drive Execution Environment (DXE) phase of the UEFI boot process, the contents of the capsule image are parsed during processing. An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the capsule processing phase that can cause the allocation of a buffer to be unexpectedly small. As a result, attacker-controlled data can be written past the bounds of the buffer.**Write-what-where condition in Coalescing Phase** - CVE-2014-4860During the Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) phase of the UEFI boot process, the capsule update is coalesced into its original form. Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in the coalescing phase that can be used to trigger a write-what-where condition.For more details, please refer to [MITRE's vulnerability note](https://www.mitre.org/capabilities/cybersecurity/overview/cybersecurity-blog/bios-extreme-privilege-escalation). |
| --- |

### Impact

| A local authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of system firmware, potentially allowing for persistent firmware level rootkits, bypassing of Secure Boot, or permanently DoS'ing the platform. |

### Solution

| Please see the Vendor Information section below to determine if your system may be affected. We are continuing to communicate with vendors as they investigate these vulnerabilities. |

### [Dell Computer Corporation, Inc.](#BLUU-9M9R24) Affected

Notified:  July 22, 2014  Updated: October 28, 2014

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

The security of our systems and customer information is a top priority for Dell. Dell is aware of the recent security concerns that MITRE published, and is reviewing these claims against our products. Dell will take appropriate action to resolve any security related issues found on our products and provide updates to our customers.

The vulnerability outlined by MITRE is not a Dell specific issue, but instead is a larger industry issue. An exploit of this vulnerability would have to be executed on a UEFI installed OS and executed under administrative privileges with driver-level access. Dell recommends that our customers use best security practices and lock down system admin modes as a standard part of their security process.

**BIOS Details**

Client Solutions (CS) commercial platforms do not use the UEFI code described in the MITRE vulnerability report during any BIOS or firmware update. The code exists in some client systems in a dormant state and may be discovered through binary analysis. Updated BIOS code has been developed to further quarantine this code during the boot process to mitigate any potential for indirect exploit. A list of BIOS update patches is included below for planning purposes and BIOS revisions are included (subject to change):
