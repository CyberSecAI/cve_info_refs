The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the EDK2 UEFI Capsule Update mechanism, including CVE-2014-4860.

**CVE-2014-4860: Write-what-where condition in Coalescing Phase**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple integer overflow vulnerabilities in the coalescing phase of the capsule update process.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflows during the Pre-EFI Initialization (PEI) phase, specifically when the capsule update is coalesced into its original form. These overflows allow for a write-what-where condition.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A local authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code with system firmware privileges. This could lead to:
    *   Persistent firmware-level rootkits
    *   Bypassing Secure Boot
    *   Permanent denial-of-service of the platform.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered during the PEI phase of the UEFI boot process, specifically during capsule update coalescing.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local, authenticated access to the system and the ability to initiate the capsule update process.

The document also provides a list of affected vendors and their statements regarding the vulnerabilities, which is more detailed than the original CVE description.
