Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-4523:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `easy-career-openings` WordPress plugin, specifically in the handling of the `page` parameter within the `printAdminUsersList_Footer.tpl.php` template.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
        *   Defacing the website.
        *   Stealing sensitive user data, including cookies.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that contains the payload within the `page` parameter, such as `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/garagesale/templates/printAdminUsersList_Footer.tpl.php?page=page%22%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E&`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker only needs to lure the victim to click on the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided information indicates the vulnerable version is <= 0.4, and there's no known fix.
*   The `wpscan.com` content confirms the XSS vulnerability and also lists an SQL injection vulnerability in the same plugin with no fix available. However, the SQL injection is a separate issue and is not related to CVE-2014-4523.
* The codevigilant.com content provides a PoC URL demonstrating the vulnerability.
