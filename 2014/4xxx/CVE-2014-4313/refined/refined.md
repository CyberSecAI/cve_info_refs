Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-4313:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Epicor Desktop software is susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the Epicor Procurement software, specifically within the user field during login when using SQL server authentication.
- Error messages generated by the database are exposed to users, which can aid attackers in crafting more effective injection payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can query and manipulate data stored in the database used as a backend of the application, by injecting SQL statements.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the user field displayed during login, specifically when SQL server authentication is enabled.
- By injecting malicious SQL statements into the username field an attacker can execute arbitrary queries against the underlying database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to access the login interface of the Epicor Procurement software.
- The attacker needs to be able to specify an authentication mechanism of "SQL server authentication".
- The attacker should have some knowledge of SQL syntax and database structure to craft an effective SQL injection.
