Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-4034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in ZeroCMS, specifically in the `zero_view_article.php` script.
*   The `article_id` parameter, passed via a GET request, is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of System Information:** Attackers can extract sensitive information about the database server.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers can potentially gain access to user credentials and other confidential data.
*   **Manipulation of Data:** Attackers can modify or delete data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is a specially crafted GET request to `zero_view_article.php`. The vulnerable parameter is `article_id`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability in `zero_view_article.php`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The `article_id` parameter in `zero_view_article.php` is vulnerable to standard SQL injection, where attackers can use techniques like `UNION SELECT` to retrieve data or inject malicious queries.
*   Example exploit URLs include:
    *   `http://localhost/zerocms/zero_view_article.php?article_id=1337+union+all+select+concat(unhex(hex(cast(database()+as+char)))),2,3,4,5,6--`
    *   `http://localhost/zerocms/zero_view_article.php?article_id=1337+union+all+select+(select+concat(unhex(hex(cast(zero_users.name+as+char))),0x20,0x7c,0x20,unhex(hex(cast(zero_users.password+as+char))))+from+`zcdb`.zero_users+limit 0,1),2,3,4,5,6--`
*   The vulnerability affects ZeroCMS version 1.0.
