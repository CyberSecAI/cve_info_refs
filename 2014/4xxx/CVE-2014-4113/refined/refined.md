  "CVE-2014-4113": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) improperly handles objects in memory, specifically when the function `xxxMNFindWindowFromPoint` returns an error code (-5) that is not correctly validated, leading to a use-after-free condition during a call to `xxxSendMessage`.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Improper handling of objects in memory",
        "NULL pointer dereference due to lack of validation of an error code.",
	"Use-after-free condition"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to complete system control. This can be used to install programs, view, change or delete data or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Local exploitation by running a specially crafted application.",
        "Triggering a crafted sequence of actions related to menu popups"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability. In some cases, convincing a user to run an attacker-controlled application is sufficient"
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a pointer being incorrectly validated before use in `win32k!xxxHandleMenuMessages` when it calls the function `xxxMNFindWindowFromPoint`. It doesn't check if the returned value is a valid pointer but only checks if the error code -1 has been returned. The value -5 is passed to `xxxSendMessage` as a valid pointer leading to an exploitable vulnerability",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Incorrect pointer validation",
        "Use of an error code as a pointer"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution in kernel mode, leading to complete control of the affected system, which can be used to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
       "Attack vectors": [
        "Local exploitation by running a specially crafted application.",
        "Manipulation of menu structures and window procedures"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the vulnerable system to exploit the vulnerability."
    },
	{
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in `win32k.sys` can be triggered by a crafted sequence of actions related to menu popups, involving a window and two-level popup menu, hooking the windowâ€™s wndproc, tracking the popup menu, and changing the wndproc to return -5. This leads to an exploitable condition during a call to xxxSendMessage.",

        "NULL pointer dereference due to lack of validation of an error code.",
