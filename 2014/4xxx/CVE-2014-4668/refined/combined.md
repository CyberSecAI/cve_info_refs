## Updated cherokee packages fix CVE-2014-4668

Publication date: 03 May 2015

Modification date: 03 May 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-4668](CVE-2014-4668.html)

## Description

```
Updated cherokee packages fix security vulnerability:

The cherokee_validator_ldap_check function in validator_ldap.c in Cherokee
 1.2.103 and earlier, when LDAP is used, does not properly consider
unauthenticated-bind semantics, which allows remote attackers to bypass
authentication via an empty password (CVE-2014-4668).

```

From: Matthew Daley <mattd@...fuzz.com>
To: oss-security@...ts.openwall.com
Subject: CVE request / advisory: Cherokee

Hi,

I'd like to request a CVE ID for this issue. It was found in Cherokee
(<<http://cherokee-project.com>>), an open-source webserver.

This is the first such request (albeit a late one); this message
serves as an advisory as well.

Affected software: Cherokee
Description: Cherokee supports authenticating users via LDAP. It does
not ensure that users provide a non-empty password when doing so. If
the underlying LDAP server allows unauthenticated binds (see RFC 4513,
section 5.1.2: <<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-5.1.2>>), an
unauthenticated bind will be performed and not the name/password-based
authenticated bind that Cherokee is expecting. This success of this
bind will cause Cherokee to authenticate the user. This allows an
attacker to authenticate as a user for which they only know the
username and not the password.
Affected versions: current releases (<= 1.2.103)
Fix: <https://github.com/cherokee/webserver/commit/fbda667221c51f0aa476a02366e0cf66cb012f88>
Reported by: Matthew Daley

I am aware that the CVE eligibility for an issue like this is
sometimes questioned, and so I would like to offer my opinion:

Having unauthenticated binds enabled on an LDAP server is indeed
dangerous because of the possibility of security issues like this one
arising. OpenLDAP denies them by default for this very reason (see
section 14.3.1 of the OpenLDAP server administrators' guide,
<<http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/security.html#Authentication%20Methods>>),
but other servers such as Microsoft's Active Directory and Novell's
eDirectory have them enabled by default.

However, the fault lies with the client application that is using the
LDAP server to authenticate and not with the server or its
configuration itself. Providing an empty password is the RFC-specified
way to perform an unauthenticated bind. It is up to clients themselves
to ensure that if they want an authenticated bind performed, and not
an unauthenticated one, that the password they provide is indeed
non-empty. When an application is binding in order to use the
resulting success/failure of the bind to decide whether to
authenticate an external user, and not in order to access privileged
LDAP directory information, this is always the case.

RFC 4513 agrees, see section 6.3.1
(<<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-6.3.1>>).

Section 5.1.2 (<<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-5.1.2>>)
recommends that servers default to disabling unauthenticated binds as
well. However, if an administrator needs or wants to enable
unauthenticated binds on a server, doing so should not cause other
applications' authentication routines to become vulnerable to bypass
in this way.

In the past, CVEs have been assigned for this issue in other
applications, such as Apache Shiro (CVE-2014-0074), JBoss
(CVE-2012-5629), Spring Security (CVE-2014-0097) and PacketFence
(CVE-2011-4068).

Please let me know if you need any further information.

Thanks,

Hash: SHA1

For reference, here is the URL mentioned on this list during the last
discussion of a CVE assignment related to LDAP and an empty string:

  <http://securitysynapse.blogspot.ca/2013/09/dangers-of-ldap-null-base-and-bind.html>

The Cherokee vulnerability here is essentially a misinterpretation of
an LDAP server response. Cherokee should be expecting the semantics:

  - If I send a username and a non-empty password, a successful bind means
    that that's the correct password for the user

  - If I send a username and an empty password, a successful bind means
    that (A) that's not the correct password for the user and (B)
    the LDAP server probably happens to allow unauthenticated information
    retrieval that might or might not be intentional

Instead, Cherokee incorrectly assumes that the semantics are:

  - If I send a username and any password (empty or non-empty), a
    successful bind means that that's the correct password for the user

Use CVE-2014-4668.

In Cherokee admin page: started server (make sure httpd is not running!) then, change Virtual server to have Document Root to point to /var/www/html (this one has an index.html file on the machine from apache installation). when saving, I choose the option to do a gracefull restart of the server.

Removing OK's for now though as it appears the patch has been added but has not been applied.

Shlomi: I noticed that this package owns /var/www/index.html, which I don't think it should.  It should just require webserver-base, which normally owns this file.  This can be fixed at a later time.

Same result, except I overlooked something then. First access from remote machine to the webserver gives the general page 'It works' (that the one from Apache), but refreshing the page then shows the Cherokee Test Page. httpd was not running (I stopped the service previous to installing cherokee) as cherokee refuses to start when apache is running. This happened exactly the same on the same remote machine when testing the x86-64 and the i586 machine in one straight after the other . Looks OK to me. ```  ---   Whiteboard: has\_procedure => has\_procedure MGA4-64-OK MGA-32-OK  Herman Viaene    2015-05-01 11:21:38 CEST   Whiteboard: has\_procedure MGA4-64-OK MGA-32-OK => has\_procedure MGA4-64-OK MGA4-32-OK  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=15755#c13)  claire robinson    2015-05-02 12:24:46 CEST  ``` Advisory updated.
