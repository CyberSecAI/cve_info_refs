Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-4668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `cherokee_validator_ldap_check` function in `validator_ldap.c` within the Cherokee web server did not properly handle unauthenticated LDAP binds. Specifically, it failed to check for an empty password when performing LDAP authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Unauthenticated Binds:** The core issue is that Cherokee was not enforcing a non-empty password when performing LDAP binds. This allowed an attacker to exploit the server if the LDAP server allows unauthenticated binds.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability led to an authentication bypass. If an LDAP server allows unauthenticated binds (where a bind is successful even without credentials) and an empty password is provided, the user could authenticate without needing the correct password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A remote attacker could gain unauthorized access to the Cherokee web server as any user with a valid username by providing an empty password, effectively bypassing authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is carried out remotely, by sending an authentication request to the web server.
*   **LDAP Authentication:** The attacker must target a web server using LDAP authentication.
*   **Empty Password:** The attack requires submitting a valid username along with an empty password in the authentication request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the web server.
*   **Knowledge of Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid username for the LDAP server.
*   **LDAP Server Configuration:** The LDAP server used by the Cherokee webserver must be configured to allow unauthenticated binds.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cherokee versions 1.2.103 and earlier.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the password is not empty before attempting to bind to the LDAP server.
