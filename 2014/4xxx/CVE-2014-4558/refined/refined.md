Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `test-plugin.php` file of the Swipehq Payment Gateway Woocommerce WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `api_url` parameter is not being sanitized before being used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS because the unsanitized `api_url` parameter is directly outputted in the response, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could be used to:
    *   Steal session cookies.
    *   Redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   Modify the content of the webpage.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `api_url` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:**  An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the malicious URL. This could be done through phishing emails or by injecting the link into other websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication, making it easily exploitable.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious URL and deliver it to the victim.
* **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable plugin and the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerable plugin is `swipehq-payment-gateway-woocommerce`.
*   The affected versions include 2.7.1 and likely earlier versions.
*   A Proof of Concept (PoC) URL is provided: `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/swipehqâpaymentâgatewayâwoocommerce/test-plugin.php?api_url=api_url%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%284%29%3C/script%3E`
*   The vulnerability is a Reflected XSS, meaning the injected script is only executed when the victim opens the malicious link.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 which is considered a medium severity.
*   There is no known fix for this vulnerability, as the plugin is closed.
