Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `CDetailView` widget in Yii Framework version 1.1.14.
- The issue occurs when the `value` property of a `CDetailView` attribute is configured using end-user inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure handling of user input:** The `CDetailView` widget, when configured to display a value based on user-provided data, does not properly sanitize or validate the input. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **PHP Code Execution:** By injecting specially crafted user inputs into the `value` property, an attacker can cause the server to execute arbitrary PHP scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary PHP script execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to:
    - Full compromise of the web server and application
    - Data theft or manipulation
    - Denial of service
    - Further attacks on other systems

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** Attackers inject malicious code within the user-supplied data that is then used to set the `value` property of the `CDetailView` widget.
- **Specific Widget:** The vulnerability is specifically present in the `CDetailView` widget.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to control user input:** The attacker must be able to influence the user inputs that are used to set the `value` property.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable widget:** The attacker needs to know that the target application is using the `CDetailView` widget with user-provided input for the `value` property.
