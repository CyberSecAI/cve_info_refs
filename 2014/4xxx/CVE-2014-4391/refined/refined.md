- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Tampered applications, specifically those signed on OS X prior to OS X Mavericks 10.9 or those using custom resource rules, could bypass code signing checks. This was due to the system not properly validating the signatures of bundles with resource envelopes that omitted resources which could influence execution.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate signature validation, specifically with respect to resource envelopes and their influence on execution. The system was not correctly identifying tampered applications due to the way it processed code signatures.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could modify an application, especially if it was signed before OS X 10.9 or used custom resource rules, and still have the system allow it to run as if it were legitimate, even on systems set to only allow apps from the Mac App Store or identified developers. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the tampered application.

- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could modify the resource files of an application. This tampering could occur after the application was initially signed. Then they could distribute the tampered application.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to modify application files after the app has been signed. They must also be able to get the tampered application onto the target machine.
