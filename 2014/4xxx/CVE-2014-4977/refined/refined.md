{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Dell SonicWALL Scrutinizer 11.01 is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple parameters of the web application, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary files to the filesystem.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "File Manipulation",
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain remote code execution on the target system. By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, the attacker can write a PHP script to the file system, then execute it by accessing the file via HTTP.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to /cgi-bin/admin.cgi (password change)",
      "HTTP POST request to /d4d/exporters.php (changeUnit parameter)",
       "HTTP GET request to /d4d/exporters.php (methodDetail parameter)",
       "HTTP GET request to /d4d/exporters.php (xcNetworkDetail parameter)"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated, although a privilege escalation vulnerability exists that allows any authenticated user to change the admin password.",
    "additional_information": "Multiple SQL injection points were identified in the application's web interface. Successful exploitation allows writing a PHP payload to the server's filesystem. The provided Metasploit modules implement exploits leveraging these vulnerabilities, including techniques to gain initial access and escalate to administrator privileges."
