## OS X Yosemite v10.10

* **802.1X**

  Impact: An attacker can obtain WiFi credentials

  Description: An attacker could have impersonated a WiFi access point, offered to authenticate with LEAP, broken the MS-CHAPv1 hash, and used the derived credentials to authenticate to the intended access point even if that access point supported stronger authentication methods. This issue was addressed by disabling LEAP by default.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-4364 : Pieter Robyns, Bram Bonne, Peter Quax, and Wim Lamotte of Universiteit Hasselt

* **AFP File Server**

  Impact: A remote attacker could determine all the network addresses of the system
