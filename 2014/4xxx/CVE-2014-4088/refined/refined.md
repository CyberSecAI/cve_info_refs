Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-4088:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly handles objects in memory. This improper handling can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability. This type of flaw occurs when software writes data to memory locations it shouldn't, potentially overwriting critical data structures and leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the user running Internet Explorer.
*   **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, a successful exploit could give the attacker full control over the affected system. This includes installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host malicious websites designed to trigger the vulnerability. By tricking users into visiting these sites, attackers can exploit the flaw.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into legitimate websites or sites that host user-provided content, such as forums or blogs.
*   **Email/IM:** Attackers can distribute links to malicious websites via email or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** Attackers do not require physical access to the target machine.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on social engineering techniques to convince users to visit the malicious web page or open a malicious link.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
*   The provided document lists CVE-2014-4088 among a series of memory corruption vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer that were patched in the same security update (MS14-052).
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   The fix involves modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*   The advisory recommends that users install the update immediately.
