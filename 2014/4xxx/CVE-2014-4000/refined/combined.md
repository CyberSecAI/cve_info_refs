**Notice:**

As always, when upgrading your Cacti installation is it advantageous to take a backup of not only your Cacti installation but your Cacti database. If you have the resources it is always suggested you run parallel installations to make sure there are not any major issues with the new version.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1417603#c0)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-30 12:06:45 UTC  ```  Cacti upstream released a new version fixing multiple security issues. [CVE-2016-2131](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2016-2131) was already fixed once but it seems that the fix wasn't enough.  It is also fixing [CVE-2014-4000](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4000) and some other potential security issues.  References:  <http://www.cacti.net/release_notes_1_0_0.php>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1417603#c1)  Andrej Nemec    2017-01-30 12:08:04 UTC  ``` Created cacti tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1417605](show_bug.cgi?id=1417605 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-4000 cacti: Multiple issues fixed in 1.0.0 version [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1417604](show_bug.cgi?id=1417604 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-4000 cacti: Multiple issues fixed in 1.0.0 version [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1417603#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-08 03:06:39 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
