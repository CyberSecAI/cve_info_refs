Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4756:

**Summary:**

CVE-2014-4756 is a security vulnerability affecting the IBM Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool. It is related to a failure in proper session cookie handling, specifically, the secure flag not being set when using SSL, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the failure of the Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool to set the "secure" flag for session cookies when running in SSL mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Insecure session cookie handling: The absence of the "secure" flag on the session cookie means it can be transmitted over non-HTTPS connections, leaving it vulnerable to interception.
- Sensitive information disclosure: The cookie could contain sensitive information which, if captured by an attacker, could lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Unauthorized access: An attacker who successfully intercepts the cookie could potentially gain unauthorized access to the Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool.
- Sensitive information disclosure: The attacker could obtain sensitive information from the captured cookie.

**Attack vectors:**

- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: An attacker could perform a MitM attack to intercept the vulnerable session cookie while it is being transmitted over an insecure connection (HTTP) or when transmitted over a compromised network
- Network sniffing: An attacker could sniff network traffic to intercept the cookie

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Network access: The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the client and the vulnerable server. This may require physical access to the network or network-level access.
- Interception capability: The attacker needs to be able to monitor and capture network packets to obtain the vulnerable cookie.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

- IBM Rational License Key Server Administration and Reporting Tool versions 8.1.4, 8.1.4.2, and 8.1.4.3.

**Remediation:**

The vulnerability is fixed in IBM Rational License Key Server Fix Pack 4 (8.1.4.4) for 8.1.4. Users should upgrade to this version to resolve the vulnerability.
