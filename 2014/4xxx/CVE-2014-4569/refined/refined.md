The provided content relates to CVE-2014-2715, not CVE-2014-4569. Therefore, I will respond with information about CVE-2014-2715.

**CVE-2014-2715**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of the `room_name` parameter in the `vv_login.php` file of the Videowhisper Live Streaming Integration WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of arbitrary script code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization on user-supplied input (`room_name` parameter) before being used in the application's response.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which can be executed by other users who visit the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious sites, etc.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious script in the `room_name` parameter. This URL can be distributed via various methods (e.g., email, links on other websites).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to craft a malicious URL and entice a victim to visit it.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code is located in `/wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-live-streaming-integration/ls/vv_login.php`

The vulnerable parameter is `room_name`
An example of a malicious request can be:
`http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-live-streaming-integration/ls/vv_login.php?room_name=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E%26`

The provided diff from the Trac changeset shows that the fix introduced a `sanV()` function call before using the `roomName` variable which helps to mitigate the XSS vulnerability.
