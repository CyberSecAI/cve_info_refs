Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4541:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `preview-shortcode-external.php` file of the "omfg-mobile" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. Specifically, the `shortcode` parameter in the `preview-shortcode-external.php` script is not sanitized before being included in the HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, allowing them to hijack a user's session.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could modify the appearance of the website.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites or initiate downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Manipulation:** The attack vector is via a crafted URL. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `shortcode` parameter of the `preview-shortcode-external.php` file.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker could potentially trick a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter name (`shortcode`) and its location within the WordPress plugin's file structure.
- **Ability to construct URL:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload.

**Technical Details:**
The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates a simple XSS payload:
`http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/omfgâmobile/shortcode-generator/preview-shortcode-external.php?shortcode=shortcode%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E`
This payload injects a JavaScript alert box that displays the document cookies. An attacker could replace the alert with more malicious code.

**Additional Notes**
- The identified vulnerability was in version 1.1.26 and likely lower versions.
- The plugin is closed and not available in the WordPress plugin repository anymore, according to the information from wpscan.com.
