## CVE-2014-4218

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a flaw within the Libraries component of Java SE, where interface arrays were not properly cloned before being passed to proxy methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Cloning:** The core weakness lies in the incorrect handling of interface arrays, specifically not cloning them before passing them to proxy methods. This leads to the original array being directly exposed to the proxy method.
*   **Security Restriction Bypass:** An untrusted Java application or applet could potentially use this flaw to bypass intended security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Integrity Impact:** The primary impact is on the integrity of the system, as an attacker can manipulate the original interface array through the proxy method, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors and corrupted data.
*   **Information Disclosure** Although less likely, one source indicates the potential for some sensitive information disclosure. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker.
*   **Untrusted Java Code:** The attack vector involves leveraging an untrusted Java application or applet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute untrusted Java code:** The attacker must have the capability to execute their own java code, such as through a malicious applet.
*   **Network Access (Remote):** The attack can be carried out remotely, implying the attacker can be positioned outside of the target environment.
*   **Knowledge of Java Proxy methods:** The attacker would need to have knowledge of the underlying method calls and the use of Proxy objects within Java to take advantage of this weakness.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple versions of Java SE, including 5.0u65, 6u75, 7u60, and 8u5, as well as OpenJDK versions.
*   Patches have been released by Oracle and other distributions (like Red Hat, Debian, and SUSE) to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability is related to the Libraries component, making certain parts of Java vulnerable.
*   The vulnerability has been rated as "important" or "medium" by various vendors and security tracking organizations.
*   The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution under very limited circumstances, as noted in IBM's security bulletin.
*   The affected components include both the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the Java Development Kit (JDK).
*   There are indications that this vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer from Red Hat Product Security.
*   The fix for this issue included ensuring that interfaces are properly cloned before being passed to proxy methods, preventing modification of shared interface arrays.

This vulnerability demonstrates how subtle issues in handling objects within a programming language can lead to significant security risks. The lack of proper cloning exposes internal objects to untrusted code, allowing manipulation of data in a way not intended by the designers of the Java platform.
