| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-07-16 09:24:05 UTC  ``` The following was reported: ... The function "rs_filter_graph" located in file ./librawstudio/rs-filter.c contains the following code:          g_string_append_printf(str, "}\n");         g_file_set_contents("/tmp/rs-filter-graph", str->str, str->len, NULL);          ignore = system("dot -Tpng >/tmp/rs-filter-graph.png </tmp/rs-filter-graph");         ignore = system("gnome-open /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png");  This code makes insecure use of two temporary files:  	/tmp/rs-filter-graph.png     /tmp/rs-filter-graph  This allows the truncation of arbitrary files which are owned by the user running rawstudio - for example:  	ln -s ~/.important /tmp/rs-filter-graph 	ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c1)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-07-16 09:24:19 UTC  ```  Created rawstudio tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1120094](show_bug.cgi?id=1120094 "CLOSED ERRATA - rawstudio: Insecure use of temporary file [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c2)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-07-16 09:34:22 UTC  ``` CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/160>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-07-17 04:54:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vasyl Kaigorodov from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c2)) > CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/160>  MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-4978](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4978) to this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c4)  Gianluca Sforna    2014-10-03 06:56:36 UTC  ``` Upstream seems dead, last commit is on February, maybe it's time to retire the package.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c5)  Anders Brander    2014-12-03 07:07:26 UTC  ``` This is upstream - not dead :)  Please note that this function can not be called by end users without modifying Rawstudio source. We disabled it in march 2011.  Fix is here for future references: <https://github.com/rawstudio/rawstudio/commit/9c2cd3c93c05d009a91d84eedbb85873b0cb505d>  - but IMO the fix is not very important. End users cannot call this without adding a "FilterGraph" menuitem to ui.xml.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c6)  Fedora Update System    2015-07-18 02:03:11 UTC  ``` rawstudio-2.1-0.1.20150511git983bda1.fc22 has been pushed to the Fedora 22 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1120093#c7)  Sergio Basto    2015-07-18 05:26:11 UTC  ``` Closing   ``` |  |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Date: Tue, 15 Jul 2014 19:38:42 +0100
```
Package: rawstudio
Version: 2.0-1.1
Severity: important

Dear Maintainer,

The function "rs_filter_graph" located in file ./librawstudio/rs-filter.c contains the following code:

        g_string_append_printf(str, "}\n");
        g_file_set_contents("/tmp/rs-filter-graph", str->str, str->len, NULL);

        ignore = system("dot -Tpng >/tmp/rs-filter-graph.png </tmp/rs-filter-graph");
        ignore = system("gnome-open /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png");

This code makes insecure use of two temporary files:

	/tmp/rs-filter-graph.png
        /tmp/rs-filter-graph

This allows the truncation of arbitrary files which are owned by the user running
rawstudio - for example:

	ln -s ~/.important /tmp/rs-filter-graph
	ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png

This function should be updated to use a secure temporary file.

Steve

```
Hello,

The following was reported:
...
The function "rs_filter_graph" located in file
./librawstudio/rs-filter.c contains the following code:

         g_string_append_printf(str, "}\n");
         g_file_set_contents("/tmp/rs-filter-graph", str->str, str->len, NULL);

         ignore = system("dot -Tpng >/tmp/rs-filter-graph.png </tmp/rs-filter-graph");
         ignore = system("gnome-open /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png");

This code makes insecure use of two temporary files:

    /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png
    /tmp/rs-filter-graph

This allows the truncation of arbitrary files which are owned by
the user running rawstudio - for example:

    ln -s ~/.important /tmp/rs-filter-graph
    ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/rs-filter-graph.png

Can CVE be assigned to this?
