Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-4955:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an XSS injection because of an unescaped table name in the triggers page within phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a self-XSS that is triggered by a crafted trigger name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the context of the user's browser when viewing the database triggers page, leading to potential data exfiltration, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. This is considered a non-critical vulnerability because it is a "self-XSS".

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is triggered by navigating to the database triggers page and viewing a table with a specially crafted trigger name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in phpMyAdmin user to access the database triggers page. The usual token protection mechanism prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the vulnerable page.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Frans Ros√©n of Detectify.
- The affected versions are phpMyAdmin 4.0.x prior to 4.0.10.1, 4.1.x prior to 4.1.14.2, and 4.2.x prior to 4.2.6.
- The fix involves escaping the table name before outputting it in the database triggers page. This was done in commit [10014d4dc596b9e3a491bf04f3e708cf1887d5e1](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/10014d4dc596b9e3a491bf04f3e708cf1887d5e1) for the main branch, [1b5592435617fa1b9dd68e2dc263de64c69fdc8a](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/1b5592435617fa1b9dd68e2dc263de64c69fdc8a) for the 4.0 branch, and [511c596b175889b8e6b9c423e352ca64fa20af2b](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/511c596b175889b8e6b9c423e352ca64fa20af2b) for the 4.1 branch.
- The openSUSE security update addresses this and other CVEs with a phpMyAdmin version upgrade to 4.1.14.3.
