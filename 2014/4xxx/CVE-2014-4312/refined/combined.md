"Epicor Enterprise vulnerabilities"

- Affected vendor: Epicor Software Corporation
- Affected system: Epicor Enterprise - Version 7.4
- Vendor disclosure date: May 13th, 2014
- Public disclosure date: September 30th, 2014
- Status: Fixed

- Associated CVEs:

  1) CVE-2014-4311
  Password values not masked appropriately:
  Even though the application appears to be masking the affected password values
in the database connection and email settings page, it is possible to access
their content by observing the HTML code.

  Affected password values:
  - “Database Connection”
  - “E-mail Connection”

  Associated CAPEC:
  CAPEC-167: Lifting Sensitive Data from the Client -
<https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/167.html>

  Associated CWE:
  CWE-200: Information Exposure - <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html>

  2) CVE-2014-4312
  Persistent and reflective cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks possible:
  The identified website is vulnerable to persistent and reflective cross-site
scripting. Script injection is a weakness within an application, and is due to
insufficient validation of the input data (i.e. input data being sent from the
user/presentation layer) and output encoding allowing dynamic execution of
scripts on the application front end resulting in anomalous/abnormal behaviour
of the application.

  Example of affected functionalities for persistent XSS:
   - 1. While viewing Order details, and injecting a malicious payload on the
"Notes" section.
   - 2. While modifying an “Order to consume” and injecting a malicious payload
on the "Description" section.
   - 3. While observing the “Favorites” section and and injecting a malicious
payload on the “Favorites name” section.
     Example of an injected payload: <script>alert("XSS")</script>

  Example of affected URLs for reflective XSS:
  - 1.
<https://XXXXX/Procurement/EKPHTML/search_item_bt.asp?RecordsRequested=Yes&FiltPartNo=&FiltSupplier=-1&FiltKeyword=><script>alert("XSS")</script>
  - 2.
<https://XXXXX/Procurement/EKPHTML/EnterpriseManager/Budget/ImportBudget_fr.asp?Act=dtt">;><script>alert("XSS")</script>
  - 3. <https://XXXXX>
/Procurement/EKPHTML/EnterpriseManager/UserSearchDlg.asp?hdnPageName=UserSearch&hdnOpenerFormName=PrefApp&hdnApproverFieldName=temp1&hdnApproverIDFieldName=temp2&hdnUserID=200&hdnOpener=Test"><script>alert("XSS")</script>
  - 4.
<https://XXXXX/Procurement/EKPHTML/EnterpriseManager/UserSearchDlg.asp?hdnOpenerFormName=PrefApp&hdnApproverFieldName=">;><script>alert("XSS")</script>
  - 5.
<https://XXXXX/Procurement/EKPHTML/EnterpriseManager/Codes.asp?INTEGRATED=XSS">;>--><script>alert("XSS")</script>

  Associated CAPEC:
  CAPEC-32: Embedding Scripts in HTTP Query Strings -
<https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/32.html>

  Associated CWE:
  CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
('Cross-site Scripting') - <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html>

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| | CAPEC-167: White Box Reverse Engineering | | --- |  | Attack Pattern ID: 167**Abstraction: Standard** |  |  | | --- | --- | --- |   View customized information:  Conceptual Operational Mapping-Friendly Complete   + DescriptionAn attacker discovers the structure, function, and composition of a type of computer software through white box analysis techniques. White box techniques involve methods which can be applied to a piece of software when an executable or some other compiled object can be directly subjected to analysis, revealing at least a portion of its machine instructions that can be observed upon execution. + Typical Severity Medium + RelationshipsSection HelpThis table shows the other attack patterns and high level categories that are related to this attack pattern. These relationships are defined as ChildOf and ParentOf, and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as CanFollow, PeerOf, and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar attack patterns that the user may want to explore.  | Nature | Type | ID | Name | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ChildOf | Meta Attack PatternMeta Attack Pattern - A meta level attack pattern in CAPEC is a decidedly abstract characterization of a specific methodology or technique used in an attack. A meta attack pattern is often void of a specific technology or implementation and is meant to provide an understanding of a high level approach. A meta level attack pattern is a generalization of related group of standard level attack patterns. Meta level attack patterns are particularly useful for architecture and design level threat modeling exercises. | 188 | [Reverse Engineering](/data/definitions/188.html) | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | ParentOf | Detailed Attack PatternDetailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow. Detailed attack patterns are more specific than meta attack patterns and standard attack patterns and often require a specific protection mechanism to mitigate actual attacks. A detailed level attack pattern often will leverage a number of different standard level attack patterns chained together to accomplish a goal. | 37 | [Retrieve Embedded Sensitive Data](/data/definitions/37.html) | | ParentOf | Detailed Attack PatternDetailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow. Detailed attack patterns are more specific than meta attack patterns and standard attack patterns and often require a specific protection mechanism to mitigate actual attacks. A detailed level attack pattern often will leverage a number of different standard level attack patterns chained together to accomplish a goal. | 190 | [Reverse Engineer an Executable to Expose Assumed Hidden Functionality](/data/definitions/190.html) | | ParentOf | Detailed Attack PatternDetailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow. Detailed attack patterns are more specific than meta attack patterns and standard attack patterns and often require a specific protection mechanism to mitigate actual attacks. A detailed level attack pattern often will leverage a number of different standard level attack patterns chained together to accomplish a goal. | 191 | [Read Sensitive Constants Within an Executable](/data/definitions/191.html) | | ParentOf | Detailed Attack PatternDetailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Each association implies a weakness that must exist for a given attack to be successful. If multiple weaknesses are associated with the attack pattern, then any of the weaknesses (but not necessarily all) may be present for the attack to be successful. Each related weakness is identified by a CWE identifier.  | CWE-ID | Weakness Name | | --- | --- | | [1323](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1323.html) | Improper Management of Sensitive Trace Data |  + Content History  | Submissions | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Submission Date | Submitter | Organization | | 2014-06-23(Version 2.6) | CAPEC Content Team | The MITRE Corporation | |  | | | Modifications | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Modification Date | Modifier | Organization | | 2015-11-09(Version 2.7) | CAPEC Content Team | The MITRE Corporation | | Updated Activation\_Zone, Attack\_Prerequisites, Description Summary, Injection\_Vector, Payload, Payload\_Activation\_Impact, Related\_Attack\_Patterns, Related\_Weaknesses, Resources\_Required | | | 2020-12-17(Version 3.4) | CAPEC Content Team | The MITRE Corporation | | Updated Related\_Weaknesses | | | 2023-01-24(Version 3.9) | CAPEC Content Team | The MITRE Corporation | | Updated Related\_Weaknesses | | | Previous Entry Names | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Change Date | Previous Entry Name | | | | 2015-11-09(Version 2.7) | Lifting Sensitive Data from the Client | | |  | | |   More information is available — Please select a different filter. |
