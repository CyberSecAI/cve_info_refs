**CVE-2014-3797**

*   **Root Cause:** A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vCSA is susceptible to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user logged into vCenter, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack requires tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link or opening a malicious web page while they are logged into vCenter. This indicates a user-interaction vector, likely involving phishing or social engineering.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link or web page and convince a logged-in vCenter user to interact with it. The attacker does not need to be directly connected to the internal network initially but does need to get the user to interact with the malicious content.
