Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-4501

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when handling a URL provided in a `client.reconnect` message within the Stratum mining protocol. Specifically, the `extract_sockaddr` function did not validate the length of the URL before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `extract_sockaddr` function. If a mining pool or malicious actor sends a `client.reconnect` message with an overly long URL, the copy operation overflows the buffer leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** A successful stack overflow can potentially allow an attacker to overwrite the return address, leading to arbitrary code execution. This could enable the attacker to take control of the mining client.
- **Denial of Service:** Even without code execution, overflowing the buffer could crash the mining software leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Stratum Pool:** A malicious mining pool can send a crafted `client.reconnect` message to connected miners.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker performing a MitM attack on a stratum connection could inject a malicious `client.reconnect` message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the mining client. This includes controlling the mining pool the client connects to or being in a position to intercept and modify stratum communication between a miner and a pool.

**Affected Software:**
- SGMiner before 4.2.2
- CGMiner before 4.3.5
- BFGMiner before 3.3.0

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found and reported by Mick Ayzenberg of Deja vu Security.
- The fix was to truncate the overlong address before copying it, preventing the buffer overflow. This is evident in the code diffs provided, where a check for `url_len >= sizeof(url_address)` is added, and url\_len is modified to `sizeof(url_address) - 1` before the sprintf.
- cgminer commit e1c5050 also shows usage of `snprintf` to prevent overflow
