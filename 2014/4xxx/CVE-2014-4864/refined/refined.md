- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Netgear ProSafe Plus Configuration Utility stores the device password in plaintext within the configuration backup file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (plaintext password) in a backup file, identified as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker who gains access to the configuration backup file can retrieve the administrative password, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the configuration backup file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to the configuration backup file. This could be through network access, physical access, or other means to obtain the file.
