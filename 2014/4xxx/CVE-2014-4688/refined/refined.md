{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `status_rrd_graph_img.php` script. It allows for command injection via the `database` parameter.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection vulnerability in the `database` parameter of `status_rrd_graph_img.php`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system, potentially leading to a reverse shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `status_rrd_graph_img.php` script with a malicious payload injected into the `database` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable pfSense instance. They also need valid credentials to log in to the pfSense web interface, and have knowledge of a valid CSRF token to bypass CSRF protection."
