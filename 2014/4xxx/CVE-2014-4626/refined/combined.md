## EMC Documentum products contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#315340

Original Release Date: 2014-12-15 | Last Revised: 2017-01-06

---

### Overview

EMC Documentum products including Content Server, D2, and Web Development Kit (WDK) contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| EMC Documentum Content Server, D2, and WDK contain numerous vulnerabilities of varying impact. For details, view our [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DiiUPCPvmaliWcfwPSc36y2mDvuidkDKQBWqaIuJi0A/edit?usp=sharing). For status from the vendor, please visit <https://support.emc.com/docu38558> (requires EMC Online Support credentials). Search by CVE ID and/or ESA ID referenced in the spreadsheet.  The CVSS score below reflects use of backdoor credentials (see VU#184360, VU#695112, and VU#982432 in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DiiUPCPvmaliWcfwPSc36y2mDvuidkDKQBWqaIuJi0A/edit?usp=sharing)). |
| --- |

### Impact

| The severity of impact varies. Specific examples include information disclosure, privilege escalation, authentication bypass, arbitrary code execution, shell command injection, and unauthorized access via backdoor credentials. Worst-case scenarios allow an attacker to take complete control of a vulnerable system. |

These fixes were rolled into 6.7 SP1 P22 and later.COMMENTS:Both Win-SQL and Linux-Oracle platforms have been fixed. | The status of issue is still not clear. EMC Documentum Content Server supports four RDBMSs: Oracle, MSSQL, Sybase and DB2. What does the EMC’s answer really mean, Sysbase and DB2 builds were not vulnerable or Sysbase and DB2 builds were not remediated? | The fix was done at the common layer.

| 4 | VU#830192 | CVE-2014-2518VRF#HUDBRX6QPSRC-2083ESA-2014-073 | Multiple EMC Documentum WDK applications (Webtop, Taskspace, Documentum Administrator, etc) contain CSRF vulnerabilities. | EMC Documentum WDK applications use the MVC design pattern, where controllers/views could be accessed directly through specific URLs like “/webtop/component/<controller/view name>?<controller/view startup arguments>”. Some controllers/views accept “query” as a startup argument and execute the passed query upon startup, making such controllers/views vulnerable to CSRF attacks. | THIS HAS BEEN FIXED: EMC Documentum Webtop versions 6.7 SP1 P28 or laterEMC Documentum Webtop versions 6.7 SP2 P15 or laterEMC Documentum Administrator versions 6.7 SP1 P28 or laterEMC Documentum Administrator versions 6.7 SP2 P15 or laterEMC Documentum Administrator versions 7.0 P15 or laterEMC Documentum Administrator versions 7.1 P06 or laterEMC Documentum Taskspace versions 6.7 SP1 P28 or laterEMC Documentum Taskspace versions 6.7 SP2 P15 or laterEMC Documentum Records Manager versions 6.7 SP1 P28 or laterEMC Documentum Records Manager versions 6.7 SP2 P15 or laterEMC Documentum Web Publisher versions 6.5 SP7 P15 or laterEMC Documentum Digital Asset Manager versions 6.5 SP6 P15 or laterEMC Documentum Engineering Plant Facilities Management Solution for Documentum 1.7 SP1, supported on WebTop 6.7 SP1 versions patch 13 or laterEMC Documentum Capital Projects 1.8, supported on WebTop 6.7 SP1 versions patch 11 or laterEMC Documentum Capital Projects 1.8, supported on WebTop 6.7 SP2 versions patch 11 or laterEMC Documentum Capital Projects 1.9, supported on WebTop 6.7 SP2 versions patch 01 or later. All instances will be fixed in 6.8 - coming out in Q4.COMMENTS:The fixes published in the ESA only apply to the instances reported originally. A more comprehensive fix will be released with WDK 6.8. | FIX CONTESTED:After extra analysis we can find that following controllers are vulnerable:-auditlist (comes from Documentum Administrator, not webtop, so this one is not mentioned in previous listing)-search-dqleditor (fixed in previous patches – does not accept “query” argument anymore)-appintxdql (fixed in previous patches – does not accept “query” argument anymore)-historicalactivityreportresults-processdetailreportresults-historicalprocessreportresults-historicaluserreportresultsAdditionally we should understand that there are controllers which are able to launch another controllers (examples 11, 12), and “actions” which are able to launch vulnerable controllers. | The fix for this depends on PSRC-2003 and it was fixed.  ESA-2015-131 CVE-2015-4531  Fixed version: • EMC Documentum Content Server 6.7SP1P32 or later • EMC Documentum Content Server 6.7SP2P25 or later • EMC Documentum Content Server 7.0P19 or later • EMC Documentum Content Server 7.1P16 or later • EMC Documentum Content Server 7.2P02 or later" | The fix for this depends on PSRC-2003 and it was fixed.

| 5 | VU#504416 | CVE-2014-4622VRF#HUDHKNW4PSRC-2072ESA-2014-091 | EMC Documentum Content Server: multiple issues in ESA-2012-009 were not properly analyzed and fixed. | 1. Sysadmin is not able to modify dm\_superusers\_dynamic and dm\_superusers system groups (dm\_superusers membership grants superuser privileges), but he is able to modify groups that belongs to dm\_superusers system group.2. Sysadmin is able to perform dump and load operations, and may create malicious superusers through load operation.3. Sysadmin is able to create dm\_method objects, so he is able to execute any code on Content Server, thereby elevating privileges.4. Sysadmin is able to create and modify dm\_client\_rights objects, which store information about capabilities of remote clients. By creating and modifying dm\_client\_rights objects, sysadmin is able to elevate privileges.5. Sysadmin is able to create and modify dmc\_module objects that execute code on java-clients such as Documentum Java Method Server, enabling him to execute any code on Documentum Java Method Server and thereby elevate privileges. | THIS HAS BEEN FIXED: EMC Documentum Content Server 7.1 P08 and laterEMC Documentum Content Server 7.0 P15: Hotfix is available for Windows and Linux. For Solaris and AIX, contact EMC Support.EMC Documentum Content Server 6.7 SP2 P17 and laterEMC Documentum Content Server 7.0: Hotfix is available for Windows and Linux. For Solaris and AIX, contact EMC Support. The fixes are rolled into CS 7.0 P16. | FIX CONTESTED:The first issue (elevating privileges through modifying dcs\_privileged\_users group) was fixed, other issues were not fixed, also see comment about sysadmin privilege in VRF#HW7M2PO2. | This is being tracked by PSRC-2517. The fix requires updates to scripts provided by third party. Due to external dependancy, it will take some time to fully address the root cause. ETA for fix: Q2’16. | CVE-2014-2507ESA-2014-046The third party library vendor is not able to provide the fix to EMC at this point, so we are limited to implementing mitigations on Documentum Content Server layer only. The interim fix with backlisting approach to mitigate known attack vectors was implemented in the following versions:• EMC Documentum Content Server version 7.2 P13 and later• EMC Documentum Content Server version 7.1 P29 and later• EMC Documentum Content Server version 7.0 P24 and laterMore comprehensive fix using whitelisting approach is being planned for future releases of the product. New security advisory will be released when the fixes are available. |

Consequently, a user is able to modify any object in the system using a crafted RPC save-command. | THIS HAS BEEN FIXED: EMC Documentum Content Server version 7.1 P05 and laterEMC Documentum Content Server version 7.0 P15 and laterEMC Documentum Content Server version 6.7 SP2 P14 and laterEMC Documentum Content Server version 6.7 SP1 P28 and laterCOMMENTS:See VU#160160 below for more details on additional attack vectors after the original fix. | FIX CONTESTED:Why is VRF#HUFG9EBA marked as fixed? | Additional exploits were fixed as part of PSRC-2493/ESA-2015-131/CVE-2015-4533.   New exploits were discovered after disclosing PSRC-2493. The latest exploits are tracked via PSRC-3048. ETA for the fix fro PSRC-3048: October, 2015.

The researcher now discusses new ways to exploit the vulnerability.The product team is aware of this and have determined that this warrants a longer term approach rather than point fixes which is currently under discussion. | FIX CONTESTED:In CVE-2014-2507 vendor just made changes in dm\_event\_sender.ebs (applied changes were described in VRF#HUFOKCF1) to prevent attack on "mailScript" parameter, but those changes are not reflected in dm\_html\_sender.ebs [Applies to PSRC-2074, PSRC-2075]In VRF#HUFOKCF1 the researcher has clearly outlined a vulnerable code.
