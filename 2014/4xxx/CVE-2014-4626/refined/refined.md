Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4626:

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Affected Product:** EMC Documentum Content Server
*   **Vulnerability:** Any user is able to elevate privileges, hijack Content Server filesystem, and execute arbitrary commands by creating malicious `dm_job` objects.
*   **Root Cause:** Documentum Content Server includes docbase methods that use special permissions to prevent method invocation by regular users. Users can bypass these restrictions by crafting `dm_job` objects containing arbitrary commands to be executed and by setting the owner of the object to a privileged user. This bypasses intended access controls.
*   **Attack Vector:** Create a malicious `dm_job` object containing arbitrary commands and set the owner of the object to a privileged user.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, filesystem hijacking, arbitrary command execution. An attacker could gain complete control over the vulnerable system.
