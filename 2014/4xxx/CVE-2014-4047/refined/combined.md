Project Security Advisory - AST-2014-007

| **Product** | Asterisk |

| **CVE Name** | CVE-2014-4047 |

| **Description** | Establishing a TCP or TLS connection to the configured HTTP or HTTPS port respectively in http.conf and then not sending or completing a HTTP request will tie up a HTTP session. By doing this repeatedly until the maximum number of open HTTP sessions is reached, legitimate requests are blocked. |

| **Resolution** | The patched versions now have a session\_inactivity timeout option in http.conf that defaults to 30000 ms. Users should upgrade to a corrected version, apply the released patches, or disable HTTP support. |
