Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Asterisk handles HTTP connections. If a TCP or TLS connection is established to the configured HTTP/HTTPS port but no complete HTTP request is sent, the connection remains open, consuming a session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Resource Exhaustion:** The core issue is the lack of a timeout mechanism for incomplete HTTP sessions. This allows an attacker to exhaust the maximum number of open HTTP sessions by repeatedly opening connections without sending proper requests.
- **Missing Session Timeout:** The absence of a session inactivity timeout on the HTTP/HTTPS ports is a critical weakness that enables the denial-of-service attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exhausting available HTTP sessions, legitimate requests are blocked. This prevents normal operation and access to HTTP-based services provided by Asterisk.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Unauthenticated Sessions:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without requiring any prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish TCP/TLS connections to the Asterisk server's HTTP/HTTPS ports.
- **Ability to Open Connections:** The attacker must be able to send incomplete HTTP connection requests repeatedly.

**Additional Details:**

- The advisory provides specific affected versions of Asterisk and indicates the corrected versions as well as patches for various branches.
- A fix has been provided by implementing a `session_inactivity` timeout option in `http.conf` which defaults to 30000ms.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions and branches of Asterisk.
