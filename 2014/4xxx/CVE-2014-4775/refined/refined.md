- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to unprotected authentication credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The system stores or transmits authentication credentials in a manner that makes them vulnerable to exposure.
-  **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not specified in detail, but it is implied that successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not described but the vulnerability exists in the software and could be exploited through a network connection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or access the exposed authentication credentials. The content does not specify if an attacker needs to have internal network access or not.
