Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `fpg_preview.php` file of the Flash Photo Gallery WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS. Specifically, the `path` parameter in the `fpg_preview.php` script is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal cookies, allowing them to hijack user sessions.
- **Defacement:** An attacker could deface the website.
- **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `path` parameter of `fpg_preview.php`.
- Example malicious URL:  `http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/wp-content/wp-plugs/flashâphotoâgallery/fpg_preview.php?path=path%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin:** The attacker needs to know that the target site is using the vulnerable Flash Photo Gallery plugin (versions 0.7 and possibly lower).
- **Ability to send a crafted link:** The attacker must be able to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL.
