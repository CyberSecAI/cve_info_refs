- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Remote attacker could send a malformed HTTP request by persuading an authenticated user to visit a malicious website.
    - This can lead to cross-site scripting attacks, web cache poisoning, and other malicious activities
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Remote attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into visiting a malicious website.
    - The attacker can then send a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user of the application into visiting a malicious website.
