Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4595:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `wp-restful` WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `oauth_callback`, `oauth_token_temp`, and `oauth_callback_temp` parameters in the `html_api_authorize.php` and `html_api_login.php` files are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to the lack of sanitization on the aforementioned parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of malicious JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
- Potential for cookie theft, session hijacking, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities that can be carried out using client-side scripting.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs that include malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters (`oauth_callback`, `oauth_token_temp`, and `oauth_callback_temp`).
- The attacker needs to induce a user to visit the malicious link (e.g. through social engineering, or by embedding it in an email, another website, etc.).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication or specific privileges on the target website.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute malicious links, e.g. by hosting them on the internet.
- The attacker does not require access to the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The plugin is closed and no fix is available.
- The identified version affected is 0.1, but lower versions might also be affected.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on June 12, 2014.
