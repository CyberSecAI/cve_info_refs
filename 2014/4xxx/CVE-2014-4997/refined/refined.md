Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `point-cli` Ruby gem's `setup.rb` file, where a `curl` command is constructed using string interpolation with a username and password. This command is then executed via backticks. The interpolated username and password are included in the command line, exposing them to the process table.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Process Table Exposure:** The primary vulnerability is that the username and password are exposed as part of the command line when the `curl` command is executed using backticks, making them visible in the process table.
- **Potential for Remote Command Injection (Conditional):** The advisory notes that *if* the gem is used in the context of a Rails application *and if* the username and password are supplied by the user, it is possible to inject commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker could gain access to the username and password by examining the process table.
- **Potential Command Injection:**  In specific scenarios (Rails application context with user-supplied credentials), an attacker might be able to inject malicious commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Process Examination:** An attacker with local access to the system could view the process table and extract the exposed credentials.
- **Remote Command Injection:** A remote attacker could potentially inject commands, but this requires the gem being used in a specific context where user-provided input is used for credentials, which is not always guaranteed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access:** To directly view the process table, an attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Rails application context (for remote injection):** For the remote command injection to be possible the gem needs to be utilized in a Rails application and user supplied input needs to be used for the username and password.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory references OSVDB-108577, which may contain additional information.
- The `curl` command is executed using backticks, which captures its output, and is then checked for a specific pattern using a regular expression.
- The advisory and the original report both highlight the exposure of credentials via the process table.
- The potential for command injection is conditional, and depends on how the gem is used.
