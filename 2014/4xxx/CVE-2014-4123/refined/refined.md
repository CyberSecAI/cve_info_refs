Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-4123:

**CVE Description:**

CVE-2014-4123 is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Internet Explorer. It exists because Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing scripts to run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to run. However, it can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) to take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the improper validation of permissions by Internet Explorer when handling scripts. This allows a malicious script to bypass security checks and execute with higher privileges than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Permission Validation:** Internet Explorer fails to correctly check and enforce permissions during script execution, leading to the possibility of privilege elevation.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** The core weakness is the ability of a malicious actor to escalate their privileges within the context of the Internet Explorer process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privileges:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can elevate their privileges within the Internet Explorer process. This allows them to perform actions with more permissions than they initially had.
*   **Chained Exploits:** This vulnerability does not directly enable arbitrary code execution. However, when combined with a separate remote code execution vulnerability, it can enhance the impact of that exploit by allowing the attacker's code to run with a higher integrity level (permissions of the current user).  For example, if a remote code execution exploit runs code at a low integrity level, the attacker can use this exploit to elevate the privileges to the medium integrity level (user level).
*   **Potential for System Compromise:** By combining this vulnerability with a remote code execution vulnerability, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the system if the user is logged in with administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers could host malicious websites designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers could inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that accept user-generated content.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website or open an attachment containing malicious content, often through methods like phishing emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one.**
*   **Ability to craft specific scripts or malicious content that exploits the vulnerability.**
*   **Need to convince the victim to interact with the malicious content via social engineering.**
*   **Ability to chain this vulnerability with another exploit to achieve arbitrary code execution.**

**Additional Notes:**

*   Microsoft's advisory states that this vulnerability was being exploited in the wild at the time the bulletin was released.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer, including versions 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
*   The fix involves adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer to properly check permissions during script execution.
