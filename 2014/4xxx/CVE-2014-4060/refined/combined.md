How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerability in Windows Media Center Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2978742)

Published: August 12, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file that invokes Windows Media Center resources. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows Media Center TV Pack for Windows Vista, all supported editions of Windows 7 except Starter and Home Basic editions, Windows Media Center when installed on Windows 8 Professional edition, and Windows Media Center when installed on Windows 8.1 Professional edition. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Component Object Model (COM) objects are handled in memory. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate whether to apply the security update to the affected systems using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table later in this bulletin.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

## CSyncBasePlayer Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2014-4060

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Windows Media Center, which could be exploited by convincing a user to open a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-4060](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-4060).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources**
  Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when MCPlayer.dll fails to properly clean up resources after a CSyncBasePlayer object is deleted.

**What is MCPlayer.dll?**

MCPlayer is a component of Windows Media Center that manages audio and video playback.

**What is the Component Object Model (COM)?**

The Component Object Model (COM) is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that are capable of interaction. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents) and ActiveX (Internet-enabled components) technologies.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing specially crafted Office files on a remote share or by attaching them to an email. When a user double-clicks the specially crafted file from a computer containing Windows Media Center, the malicious code may be able to run.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability mainly affects workstations that both run Microsoft Office and contain Windows Media Center components.

**Most Microsoft-Office-related vulnerabilities are rated Important; why is this vulnerability rated Critical?**

Most Microsoft Office vulnerabilities that require user interaction to exploit are rated Important. However, as of the publishing of this bulletin, Microsoft cannot rule out a web-based attack vector that could potentially be used to exploit the underlying vulnerable code. Accordingly, the vulnerability has been rated Critical.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Component Object Model (COM) objects are handled in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.
