Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-4060:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in `MCPlayer.dll`. Specifically, the `CSyncBasePlayer` object is not properly cleaned up after being deleted, which can lead to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the `CSyncBasePlayer` object within the `MCPlayer.dll`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution.
- An attacker can gain the same user rights as the current user. This means an attacker could potentially:
    - Install programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted Microsoft Office file. The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens this file, which then invokes Windows Media Center resources and exploits the use-after-free condition.
- Web-based attack scenarios are also possible, where a malicious website could host the crafted Office file, or compromised websites could inject malicious content to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious Office file. This could be achieved through:
    - Email attachments.
    - Hosting the file on a malicious website and enticing the user to visit the site and open the file.
    - Compromised websites.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `MCPlayer.dll`, which manages audio and video playback for Windows Media Center.
- The vulnerability is triggered by improper handling of Component Object Model (COM) objects in memory.
- The vulnerability affects Windows Media Center installations on various versions of Windows (Vista, 7, 8, 8.1). The specific affected versions and editions are outlined in the "Affected and Non-Affected Software" section of the Microsoft Security Bulletin.

This analysis is based on the information provided and aligns with the CVE description of a remote code execution vulnerability due to a use-after-free issue in Windows Media Center.
