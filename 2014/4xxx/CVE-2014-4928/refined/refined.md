Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `cId` parameter of the Invision Power Board forum CMS search module. The application attempts to filter malicious SQL queries using hardcoded blacklists but fails to prevent all malicious input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection. This means that the attacker cannot directly see the results of their injected SQL queries, but can infer information by observing changes in the application's response (e.g., presence or absence of search results).
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application uses hardcoded blacklists to filter SQL keywords (SELECT, UNION, single quotes). This approach is insufficient as attackers can employ various bypass techniques.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by using boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques. This includes usernames, passwords, and other potentially confidential data.
*   **File System Access:** Using the `load_file()` function, attackers can access and read files from the server's file system if the database user has the necessary privileges (FILE privilege).  This can be used to access configuration files and other sensitive data.
*   **Full Compromise (Potentially):** If the database user has sufficient privileges and the webserver is running with the same user, gaining code execution can be a possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious SQL code into the `cId` parameter of the search module's URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the web application and modify URL parameters.
*   **Understanding of SQL Injection Techniques:** The attacker needs a good understanding of blind SQL injection techniques, including boolean-based injection and the use of functions like `substr()`, `ascii()`, `isnull()` and `load_file()`.
*   **Database Knowledge:** Knowledge of the database type (e.g., MySQL) and syntax is helpful for crafting effective injection payloads.
*   **Privileged Database User (for file access):** To leverage `load_file()`, the database user needs to have the FILE privilege. The article also hints that if the database runs as root, the impact is bigger.
*   **Path Knowledge:** To read files using load\_file, an attacker must know the full path of the file, like `/var/www/html/board/upload/conf_global.php`, but the article explains how this could also be achieved using another public vulnerability of the same version.

**Additional Notes (from the content):**
*   The article mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in version 3.4.6 of Invision Power Board.
*   The attacker was able to bypass the hardcoded filters by using techniques such as:
    *   Boolean-based blind SQL injection using `AND 3=3--` and `AND 3=0--`.
    *   Extracting data character by character using `substr()` and `ascii()` functions.
    *   Using `load_file()` to read files from the server.
    *   Using the `isnull()` function to verify that `load_file()` could be used.
*   The vulnerability was not detected by most commercial web application scanners. SQLmap could help partially, but manual work was required for file access.
*   The author used hex encoding to avoid the blacklist on single quotes for the load\_file function.
