      "description": "The provided document from Microsoft directly addresses CVE-2014-4086.",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.",

        "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights. This could result in the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Web-based attacks: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to visit it.",
          "Compromised websites: Attackers could leverage compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content to host malicious content that exploits the vulnerability.",
           "Email or instant messaging: Attackers might trick users into clicking malicious links sent in email or instant messages."
         ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to convince a user to view the attacker-controlled content (e.g., visit a malicious website or open a malicious file). The attacker needs to craft malicious HTML/Javascript code that triggers memory corruption in Internet Explorer."
