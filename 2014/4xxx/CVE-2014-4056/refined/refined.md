Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-4056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability within Internet Explorer, stemming from the way it improperly handles objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: The vulnerability is caused by improper memory access, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. This could enable the attacker to take complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can also leverage compromised sites or those that accept user-provided content.
- Social engineering: Attackers have to convince users to visit the malicious site, typically through email or instant messenger links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to host or control a website containing the exploit.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to visit this website via some form of social engineering

**Affected Versions:**
- Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9, and 10 on Windows client systems are critically affected.
- Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9, and 10 on Windows server systems are moderately affected.

**Mitigations:**
- Using Internet Explorer on Windows Servers with Enhanced Security Configuration enabled provides some mitigation.
- Employing the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help mitigate the vulnerability.

**Workarounds:**
- Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones
- Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in the MS14-051 bulletin.
