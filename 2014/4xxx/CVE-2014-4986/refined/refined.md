CVE-2014-4986
```

Based on the provided information, here's a summary of the CVE-2014-4986 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in AJAX confirmation messages within phpMyAdmin.
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly escape column and table names when constructing AJAX confirmation messages. Specifically, a crafted column name can trigger an XSS when dropping the column in the table structure page, and a crafted table name can trigger an XSS when dropping or truncating the table in the table operations page.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into column or table names. When a user attempts to drop a column or table, the injected code is executed within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create/modify table/column names. The attacker must be authenticated to phpMyAdmin.
*   **Affected Versions:** phpMyAdmin versions 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.1), 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.2), and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.6).
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.1 or newer, 4.1.14.2 or newer, or 4.2.6 or newer. The provided commit links show the code changes that address the issue by escaping the table name using `escapeHtml()` before including it in the confirmation message.
