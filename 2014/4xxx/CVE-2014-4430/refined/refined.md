- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An encrypted volume would stay unlocked after being logically ejected, allowing it to be remounted without a password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The encryption keys were retained after the volume was logically ejected.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access to the system could remount an encrypted volume without a password after the user had logically ejected it.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker needs physical access to the machine and the ability to logically eject the encrypted volume.
