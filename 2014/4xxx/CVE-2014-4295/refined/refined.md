Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-4295:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the Java VM component of the Oracle Database Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in this document, but it's related to how the Java VM handles certain operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation can lead to partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The risk is classified as medium with a CVSS base score of 4.0
-  The provided text notes that the impact is only partial, meaning a complete compromise of the system or data is not expected.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is via the network using the Oracle Net protocol.
- A malicious actor needs to establish a database session ( "Create Session" privilege), which requires a database account, to be able to exploit the vulnerability, meaning no unauthenticated network based exploitation possible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to establish a valid Oracle Net connection to the target database server, and needs a valid database account to create a session. 
- The attacker does not need any special privileges within the database session, other than the ability to create it.
- This is not remotely exploitable without authentication, as the attacker must authenticate to the database server first, in order to create a database session.

**Affected Versions:**

- Oracle Database 11g Release 1 (11.1.0.7)
- Oracle Database 11g Release 2 (11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4)
- Oracle Database 12c Release 1 (12.1.0.1, 12.1.0.2)
