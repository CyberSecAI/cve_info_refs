The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6013.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Android device performs a MITM attack, intercepting and potentially modifying the communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be an attacker on a public Wi-Fi network or an attacker within the local network.
