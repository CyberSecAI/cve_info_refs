Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2014-6664.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to check the full SSL chain of trust.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic that should be encrypted by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploitation occurs during HTTPS connections made by the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Ability to intercept and potentially modify network traffic.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability affects multiple Android applications, with specific details available in an associated spreadsheet.
- The vulnerability was discovered using the CERT Tapioca tool.
- The vulnerability is related to a failure to implement secure SSL practices, as highlighted in the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java.
- The report mentions a related settlement by the Federal Trade Commission with vendors who failed to properly implement SSL encryption in their mobile apps.
- The advisory provides guidance on mitigation including avoiding affected applications, using web browsers instead of apps for accessing sensitive content, and avoiding untrusted networks.
- The document also includes CVSS metrics and links to related references.
