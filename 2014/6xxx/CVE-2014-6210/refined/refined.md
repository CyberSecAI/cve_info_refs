Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-6210:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is triggered by the execution of multiple `ALTER TABLE` statements in IBM DB2 and IBM InfoSphere BigInsights (Big SQL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness lies in how the DB2 server handles multiple `ALTER TABLE` statements. The processing of these statements can lead to an abnormal termination of the DB2 server process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. The DB2 server terminates abnormally, leading to database unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by executing multiple `ALTER TABLE` SQL statements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to execute SQL statements on the affected DB2 server instance. This likely requires some form of database access privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   IBM DB2 LUW (Linux, Unix, Windows) versions 9.7, 10.1, and 10.5, including various editions like Express, Workgroup, Enterprise, etc.  Also affects DB2 Connect products if a local database is created. DB2 pureScale V9.8 is also affected.
    *   IBM InfoSphere BigInsights versions 3.0 and 3.0.0.1
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Apply the recommended fix packs for the respective DB2 versions.
    *   Execute a `REORG` command after every `ALTER TABLE` statement as a temporary workaround.
* **Fixes:**
    *   DB2 V9.7: Fix Pack 11
    *   DB2 V10.1: Fix Pack 5
    *   DB2 V10.5: Fix Pack 5
    *   DB2 pureScale V9.8 : Contact IBM support for special build.
     * BigInsights 3.0 and 3.0.0.1 : Upgrade to BigInsights 3.0.0.2.
