      "Improper verification of server certificate during SSL/TLS communication.",
        "Failure to validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."

      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack through network interception."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This includes public and untrusted networks."
