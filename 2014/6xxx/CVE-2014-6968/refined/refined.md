The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6968.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate provided by a site is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- Possible outcomes include:
    - Viewing or modifying network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
    - Credential stealing.
    - Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on a network.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the victim's device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the device and the server.
