The provided content is related to CVE-2014-6713.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The main weakness is the improper SSL certificate validation in the Android applications, which stems from not properly checking the SSL/TLS chain against a trusted root CA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft, and possibly arbitrary code execution depending on the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where an attacker intercepts and manipulates network traffic between the Android device and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device (e.g., on the same Wi-Fi network) to perform a MITM attack.

**Additional Information:**
- A large number of applications were found to be affected (23,667 out of 1,000,462 tested).
- A spreadsheet is provided listing the affected applications (not included in this provided content).
- The vulnerability was discovered using CERT Tapioca.
