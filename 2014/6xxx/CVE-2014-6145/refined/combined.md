# Security Bulletin: IBM Cognos Business Intelligence Server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-6145, CVE-2014-1568, CVE-2014-4263, CVE-2012-5784, CVE-2014-3513, CVE-2014-3567 and CVE-2014-3568).

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Technology Edition that is used by IBM Cognos Business Intelligence. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in July 2014.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-3513](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3513)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak in the DTLS Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension parsing code. By sending multiple specially-crafted handshake messages, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97035> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-3567](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3567)

**DESCRIPTION:** OpenSSL is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by a memory leak when handling failed session ticket integrity checks. By sending an overly large number of invalid session tickets, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to exhaust all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97036> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-3568](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3568)

**DESCRIPTION**: OpenSSL could allow a remote attacker bypass security restrictions. When configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 2.6

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97037> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-3566](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Cognos Business Intelligence could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via the POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and calculate the plaintext of secure connections.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/97013> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-6145](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6145)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Cognos Business Intelligence is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 3.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96915> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-4263](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4263)

**DESCRIPTION**: An unspecified vulnerability related to the Security component has partial confidentiality impact, partial integrity impact and no availability impact.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 4

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/94606> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2014-1568](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-1568)

**DESCRIPTION:** Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to properly parse ASN.1 values in a digital signature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a Bleichenbacher attack variant against the RSA algorithm to forge RSA certificates and gain unauthorized access to secure data. Note: This vulnerability also affects Google Chrome.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/96194> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)

**CVE-ID:** [CVE-2012-5784](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-5784)

**DESCRIPTION**: Apache Axis 1.4, as used in multiple products, could allow a remote attacker to conduct spoofing attacks, caused by the failure to verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability using man-in-the-middle techniques to spoof an SSL server and launch further attacks against a vulnerable target.

**CVSS:**

CVSS Base Score: 4.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/79829> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
