The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6763.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This occurs because the applications do not properly verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain with a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic meant to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution, depending on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via network interception.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be on the same network as the Android device.
- Ability to intercept network traffic.
