Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6229:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `HashContext` class in `hphp/runtime/ext/ext_hash.cpp` incorrectly assumed that the key string it was handling was null-terminated. However, the key is actually a fixed-size block of data, not a null-terminated string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leakage:** The code could potentially read beyond the intended boundary of the key data if there was no null terminator within the allocated size, leaking adjacent memory.
- **Key Truncation:** If a null byte happened to exist within the key data before the allocated size, the key would be truncated, potentially affecting the security of the cryptographic operation relying on it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leak:** Attackers could potentially gain access to sensitive data residing in the memory adjacent to the key.
- **Cryptographic Weakness:** Truncated keys can weaken or nullify the security provided by hashing algorithms that rely on the integrity of input data.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability could be triggered by supplying a key with a specific size and content that does not contain a null terminator within the allocated size, or by including a null byte in the middle of the key. This could happen when creating or copying `HashContext` objects using functions such as `hash_copy`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need to be able to control the input key used in the `HashContext`. This could be through a user-supplied value in a web application, or any other context where the key is dynamically determined. No specific attacker position is mentioned, but the attacker has to be able to influence the key value used by the vulnerable code.
