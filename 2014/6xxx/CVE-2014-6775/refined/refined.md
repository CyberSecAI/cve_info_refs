The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6775.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker can intercept, view or modify network traffic that is supposed to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing, if the application transmits login information.
- Possible arbitrary code execution, depending on the application functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploitation occurs during a vulnerable application's network communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Ability to intercept network traffic.
