{
  "CVE-2014-6416": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow is present in the method that the kernel uses to handle libceph auth tokens.",
    "root_cause": "The kernel's method of handling libceph auth tokens had a fixed-size buffer of 256 bytes which was not enough for some setups. When tickets are not encrypted, `ceph_decode_copy` a simple `memcpy` wrapper did not have any size checks which led to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Lack of size check"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and panic) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted long unencrypted auth ticket to the Ceph filesystem in the Linux kernel."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a system running the vulnerable kernel and Ceph filesystem service."
  }
