Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-6300:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the micro history feature of phpMyAdmin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DOM-based XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-controlled input that is used to manipulate the DOM, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The XSS vulnerability can be leveraged to perform CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the XSS, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser.
- **Root Account Creation:** In some scenarios, the exploit can lead to the creation of a root account within the phpMyAdmin application.

**Attack vectors:**
- A logged-in user must be tricked into clicking on a crafted URL that contains malicious JavaScript code.
- This URL exploits the DOM-based XSS vulnerability in phpMyAdmin's micro history feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to deceive a logged-in phpMyAdmin user into clicking the crafted URL.
- No specific position is mentioned, but the attacker must be able to deliver the malicious URL to a target user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is considered critical.
- Affected versions include phpMyAdmin 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.3), 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.4), and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.8.1).
