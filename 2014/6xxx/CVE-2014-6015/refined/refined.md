  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the SSL/TLS certificate chain.",
      "Failure to verify that the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."

  "additional_details": {
    "testing_methodology": "Applications were tested using CERT Tapioca for dynamic SSL validation failures.",
    "affected_applications": "The vulnerability impacts numerous Android applications.",
     "mitigations": [
        "Apply updates for affected applications.",
        "Avoid using affected applications, and use alternative access methods (e.g., web browser).",
