The provided content is related to CVE-2014-6977.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means that they do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the chain of trust for SSL certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Viewing or modifying network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing.
- Possibility of arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploitation of insecure or untrusted networks, including public Wi-Fi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic (e.g., by being on the same network as the victim).
- The attacker does not need a high degree of skill, as the vulnerability stems from flaws in the application and not complex attack strategies.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using a tool called CERT Tapioca.
- A list of affected applications and their fix status is available in the provided Google Spreadsheet.
- The issue was discovered in 2012 and first published in 2014, with updates made as late as 2016.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-295 "Improper Certificate Validation" and CWE-296 "Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust".
- There is a reference to an FTC settlement with Fandango and Credit Karma for similar failures in secure data transmission.
