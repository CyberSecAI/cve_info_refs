Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6333:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Microsoft Word not properly handling objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. Specifically, the issue is related to a "double delete" operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper memory handling during the parsing of specially crafted Office files.
- A double-delete vulnerability exists, where an object might be freed twice which leads to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution within the context of the current user.
- An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted file to the user, and convinces the user to open the file in an affected version of Microsoft Office.
- **Web-based:** An attacker hosts a website containing a specially crafted Office file, or uses compromised websites to host such files. The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the website and open the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to open the crafted file. This can be done via email, instant messages, or by hosting the file on a website.
- The attacker does not need any special user rights. The impact is determined by the rights of the user who opens the file.
