```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the 'multipartRequest' servlet, allowing an attacker to manipulate the 'fileName' parameter.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability due to path traversal.",
    "Lack of authentication for the vulnerable functionality in some products."
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to denial of service or other system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/servlets/multipartRequest` with the `customIcon` parameter set to `delete` and the `fileName` parameter set to a path that includes directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the affected server. For OpManager and Social IT, no authentication is required. However, for IT360, authentication is required."
