## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (3008923)

Published: December 9, 2014 | Updated: April 14, 2015

**Version:** 3.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves fourteen privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows clients, and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 (IE 6), Internet Explorer 7 (IE 7), Internet Explorer 8 (IE 8), Internet Explorer 9 (IE 9), Internet Explorer 10 (IE 10), and Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) on affected Windows servers. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, by preventing the XSS filter in Internet Explorer from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes, by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature, and by modifying how the VBScript scripting engine handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3008923](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3008923).

## Vulnerability Information

## Multiple Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

Remote code execution vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from these vulnerabilities.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

### FAQ

**I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, or Windows Server 2012 R2. Does this mitigate these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for websites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**Does EMET help mitigate attacks that could attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities?**

Yes. The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) enables users to manage security mitigation technologies that help make it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in a given piece of software. EMET helps to mitigate these vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer on systems where EMET is installed and configured to work with Internet Explorer.

For more information about EMET, see [The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/jj653751).

## Multiple XSS Filter Bypass Vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer

XSS filter bypass vulnerabilities exist in the way that Internet Explorer disables an HTML attribute in otherwise appropriately filtered HTTP response data. The vulnerabilities could allow initially disabled scripts to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker could post on a website specially crafted content that is designed to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker would then have to convince the user to view the content on the affected website. If the user then browses to the website, the XSS filter disables HTML attributes in the specially crafted content, creating a condition that could allow malicious script to run in the wrong security context, leading to information disclosure.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause script code to run on another user's system in the guise of a third-party website. Such script code would run inside the browser when visiting the third-party website, and could take any action on the user's system that the third-party website was permitted to take. The vulnerability could only be exploited if the user clicked on a hypertext link, either in an HTML email or if the user visited an attacker's website or a website containing content that is under the attackerâs control. Any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations and terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

The update addresses the vulnerability by preventing the XSS filter in Internet Explorer from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer XSS Filter Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2014-6328](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-6328) | No | No |
| Internet Explorer XSS Filter Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2014-6365](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-6365) | No | No |

## Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2014-6368

A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer does not use the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, allowing an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass the [Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) security feature, which helps protect users from a broad class of vulnerabilities. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this ASLR bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, that could take advantage of the ASLR bypass to run arbitrary code. For example, a remote code execution vulnerability that is blocked by ASLR, could be exploited after a successful ASLR bypass.

In a web-browsing scenario, successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer. Therefore, any systems where a web browser is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to browse and read email on servers. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

The update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that affected versions of Internet Explorer properly implement the ASLR security feature.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet Explorer ASLR Bypass Vulnerability | [CVE-2014-6368](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-6368) | No | No |

## VBScript Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2014-6363

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the [VBScript](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) engine, when rendered in Internet Explorer, handles objects in memory. The vulnerability may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements by adding specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent through email.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Systems on which Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the VBScript scripting engine handles objects in memory.

The following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:

| **Vulnerability title** | **CVE number** | **Publicly Disclosed** | **Exploited** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VBScript Memory Corruption Vulnerability | [CVE-2014-6363](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-6363) | No | No |
