Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure in Microsoft Office to properly utilize Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a security feature designed to randomize memory locations of executables and libraries. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when Microsoft Office fails to use ASLR correctly while parsing specially crafted files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ASLR Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the bypass of ASLR. This makes it easier for attackers to predict the memory locations of specific instructions and data, which is a critical step for many memory corruption exploits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Feature Bypass:** The immediate impact is a security feature bypass, specifically the ASLR protection mechanism. By itself, this does not allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Facilitation of Code Execution:** However, this bypass can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability, like a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, to achieve arbitrary code execution. The ASLR bypass makes it easier to exploit the other vulnerability by making memory layout predictable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Files:** The primary attack vector involves opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file.
- **Email:** An attacker could send the malicious file to a user via email and convince them to open it.
- **Web-based attacks:** An attacker could host a malicious file on a website, or inject it into a compromised website or one that hosts user-provided content. They would need to trick the user to visit the website, usually through a link.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file, regardless of the delivery method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Files:** Attackers need the expertise to create a specially crafted Office file that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Deliver File:** They need a way to deliver this file to the victim, either via email, a malicious website, or other means.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Office 2007, 2010, and 2013.
- Word Viewer and the Preview Pane are not attack vectors for this vulnerability.
- The Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can be used as a workaround to mitigate this vulnerability by enforcing mandatory ASLR for at-risk applications.
- The vulnerability has been publicly disclosed.
- The vulnerability is rated "Important"
- The provided document includes a glossary explaining many of the security terms used.
