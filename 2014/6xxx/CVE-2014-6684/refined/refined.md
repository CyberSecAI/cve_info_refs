The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6684.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain of trust.
- Lack of proper implementation of SSL encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
- Ability to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploiting the lack of SSL certificate validation by intercepting and modifying the traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker must be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- No special privileges are required on the Android device itself.
