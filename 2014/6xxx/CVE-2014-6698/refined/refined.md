The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6698.

**Root Cause:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This failure means that the application does not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
- Attackers on the same network can view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- Possible outcomes include credential stealing and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- MITM attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic.
