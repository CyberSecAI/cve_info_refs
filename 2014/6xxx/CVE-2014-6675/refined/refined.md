Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-6675:

**Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate presented by a server is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).
*   **Weakness:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, the applications do not verify the chain of trust for SSL certificates.
*   **Impact:** An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to:
    *   Credential theft (usernames, passwords, etc.).
    *   Arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be on the same network as the Android device. This could be a public Wi-Fi network or a compromised local network.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the device and the server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability note references a CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java rule: "DRD19-J. Properly verify server certificate on SSL/TLS."
*   The vulnerability was discovered using a tool called CERT Tapioca.
*   The content includes a link to a spreadsheet containing affected applications, which is not viewable. It is stated that this spreadsheet is regularly updated with details on vulnerable applications, fixes, and testing notes.
*   It is stated that over 23,000 out of one million tested apps failed dynamic testing for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is also referenced in relation to FTC settlements with Fandango and Credit Karma.
*   The content provides a CVSS score and vector, which highlights the high severity of the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**

*   Users are advised to update affected applications, avoid using applications on untrusted networks, and avoid using affected applications.
*   Developers are encouraged to fix the SSL validation in their applications.
*   Android application stores are also encouraged to test applications before inclusion to their stores

**CVE Applicability:**

The content is relevant to the description of CVE-2014-6675 as it describes the core vulnerability of improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks.
