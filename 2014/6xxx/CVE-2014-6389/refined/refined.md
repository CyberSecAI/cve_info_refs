Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in PHPCompta/NOALYSS version 6.7.1 when processing backup requests. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the 'd' parameter in the `backup.php` script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The application uses the `passthru()` PHP function to execute commands based on user-supplied input via the `d` parameter. By injecting shell commands into the 'd' parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the vulnerable PHPCompta/NOALYSS application. This can lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the server
    *   Data breaches
    *   Malware installation
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `backup.php` script with malicious shell commands injected into the `d` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided exploit doesn't seem to require authentication

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `d` parameter in `backup.php` is the entry point for the exploit.
*   **Vulnerable Function:** The PHP `passthru()` function is used to execute the injected commands.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates creating a `exploit.php` file that contains `phpinfo()` to confirm the command execution vulnerability.

**Example of the Exploit (from the provided content):**

```
GET /phpcompta/backup.php?sa=b&t=m&d=123;%20echo%20%22%3c%3f%70%68%70%20%70%68%70%69%6e%66%6f%28%29%3b%3f%3e%22%20>%20exploit.php HTTP/1.1

```
This crafted request injects a command to create a PHP file named `exploit.php` with PHP code that outputs the `phpinfo()` information, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary commands.

**Affected Versions:**

*   PHPCompta/NOALYSS 6.7.1 5638

**Fixed Versions:**

*   PHPCompta/NOALYSS 6.7.2
