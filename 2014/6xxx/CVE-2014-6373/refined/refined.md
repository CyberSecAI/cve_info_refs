The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2014-6373.

**CVE-2014-6373**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability and convince a user to view it. The attacker could also use compromised websites or those hosting user-provided content to inject the exploit. The user needs to be convinced to visit the attacker's website, typically by clicking on a link or opening an attachment.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website and trick the user into visiting it using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
