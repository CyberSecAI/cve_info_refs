The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the TYPO3 extension "mm_forum", and specifically mentions CVE-2014-6297.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The extension failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input.
- Files were not checked against a file deny pattern.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to lack of proper sanitization of user input.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the ability to upload arbitrary files (e.g., PHP files) without proper checks.

- **CSRF:** Allows attackers to perform actions on behalf of logged-in users without their knowledge, such as creating forum posts.

**Attack vectors:**
- **XSS:** By injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied input fields.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading malicious files like PHP scripts.
- **CSRF:** By crafting malicious requests that trick a logged-in user's browser into performing unwanted actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **XSS:** Requires the ability to inject malicious scripts into the forum through user-supplied input.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Requires the ability to upload arbitrary files to the server.
- **CSRF:** Requires the user to be logged in and tricked into submitting a forged request.
