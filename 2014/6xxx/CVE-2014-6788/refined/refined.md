The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6788.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, the applications do not properly verify the server certificate during SSL/TLS connections.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. This allows them to intercept and potentially view or modify network traffic that is intended to be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft, arbitrary code execution and other impacts depending on the application's function.

**Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack through a compromised or untrusted network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be a public Wi-Fi network or any network where the attacker can intercept traffic.
