1.  VERIFIED: CVE-2014-6271 is related to a vulnerability in the Bash shell that allows for arbitrary command execution by passing crafted environment variables.

2.  Root cause of vulnerability: The root cause is improper parsing of function definitions within environment variables in GNU Bash. Specifically, Bash continues to process shell commands after the end of a function definition.

3.  Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The core vulnerability lies in bash's ability to process commands passed via environment variables after a function definition.
    - Command injection through crafted environment variables
    - Remote code execution
    - Privilege escalation

4.  Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system. In some cases, this could lead to complete system compromise.

5.  Attack vectors:
    - Crafted HTTP headers, particularly those passed to CGI scripts
    - SSH ForceCommand option
    - DHCP clients
    - Other services that pass environment variables to Bash
    - Exploitation through web interfaces, shell scripts, etc.

6.  Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Ability to send network requests with manipulated environment variables.
    - Some attack vectors require no authentication
    - Others require valid credentials

Additional Information:
- The vulnerability is triggered when bash processes environment variables, and if they contain a function definition. It continues to process shell commands after the function definition.
- The "Shellshock" vulnerability is related to CVE-2014-6271, and the initial fix for this issue was found to be incomplete, leading to subsequent CVEs: CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187. CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278.
- Multiple vendors were affected, including HP, IBM, VMWare, Cisco, and Red Hat.
- Patches often require systems to be restarted to fully resolve the vulnerability.
- Mitigations include restricting access to services through firewalls, disabling DHCP, avoiding use of CGI scripts, and using non-vulnerable versions of bash.
