How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

VMware Security Advisory

Advisory ID: VMSA-2014-0010
Synopsis:    VMware product updates address critical Bash
             security vulnerabilities
Issue date:  2014-09-30
Updated on:  2014-09-30 (Initial Advisory)
CVE numbers: CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186,
             CVE-2014-7187
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware product updates address Bash security vulnerabilities.

2. Relevant Releases (Affected products for which remediation is present)

    vCenter Log Insight 2.0

3. Problem Description

   a. Bash update for multiple products.

      Bash libraries have been updated in multiple products to resolve
      multiple critical security issues, also referred to as Shellshock.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the identifiers CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169,
      CVE-2014-7186, and CVE-2014-7187 to these issues.

      VMware products have been grouped into the following four
      product categories:

      I) ESXi and ESX Hypervisor
      ESXi is not affected because ESXi uses the Ash shell (through
      busybox), which is not affected by the vulnerability reported
      for the Bash shell.
      ESX has an affected version of the Bash shell. See table 1 for
      remediation for ESX.

      II) Windows-based products
      Windows-based products, including all versions of vCenter Server
      running on Windows, are not affected.

      III) VMware (virtual) appliances
      VMware (virtual) appliances ship with an affected version of Bash.
      See table 2 for remediation for appliances.

      IV) Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding
virtual
      appliances)

      Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding
      virtual appliances) might use the Bash shell that is part of the
      operating system. If the operating system has a vulnerable
      version of Bash, the Bash security vulnerability might be
      exploited through the product. VMware recommends that customers
      contact their operating system vendor for a patch.

      MITIGATIONS

      VMware encourages restricting access to appliances through
      firewall rules and other network layer controls to only trusted IP
      addresses. This measure will greatly reduce any risk to these
      appliances.

      RECOMMENDATIONS

      VMware recommends customers evaluate and deploy patches for
      affected products in Table 1 and 2 below as these
      patches become available.

      Column 4 of the following tables lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      Table 1 - ESXi and ESX Hypervisor
      =================================

      VMware           Product    Running  Replace with/
      Product          Version    on       Apply Patch
      ==============   =======    =======  =============
      ESXi             any        ESXi     Not affected

      ESX              4.1        ESX      Patch pending *

      ESX              4.0        ESX      Patch pending *

      * VMware will make VMware ESX 4.0 and 4.1 security patches available
      for the Bash shell vulnerability. This security patch release is an
      exception to the existing VMware lifecycle policy.

      Table 2 - Products that are shipped as a (virtual) appliance.
      =============================================================

# CVE-2014-7169

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-7156.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-7185.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-7169 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

The vulnerability is related to the way in which shell functions are passed though environment variables. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject commands into a Bash shell, depending on how the shell is invoked. The Bash shell may be invoked by a number of processes including, but not limited to, telnet, SSH, DHCP, and scripts hosted on web servers. All versions of GNU Bash starting with version 1.14 are affected by this vulnerability and the specific impact is determined by the characteristics of the process using the Bash shell. In the worst case, an unauthenticated remote attacker would be able to execute commands on an affected server. However, in most cases involving Cisco products, authentication is required before exploitation could be attempted.  Affected Products  * Cisco is currently investigating it's product line to determine which products may be affected and the extent of the impact of the vulnerability on it's products. Additional Cisco products will be added as the investigation progresses.       **The following Cisco products are currently under investigation**      *None*   Vulnerable ProductsCustomers interested in tracking the progress of any of the following bugs can visit the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool") to view the defect details and optionally select *Save Bug* and activate the *Email Notification* feature to receive automatic notifications when the bug is updated.

bash shell allows shell variables and functions to be exported to a child from its parent through the process environment. Function definitions are passed using environment variables that share the name of the function and start with `() {`.       The child bash process does not stop processing and executing code after processing the closing brace `}` which is passed in the function definition. An attacker could define a function variable such as: `FUNCT=() { ignored; }; /bin/id` to execute **/bin/id** when the environment is imported into the child process.       The impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product because some attack vectors such as SSH, require successful authentication to be exploited and may not result in any additional privileges granted to the user.      This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278.      Several software tools have been created to help administrators identify if the version of Bash running on their platforms has been fixed. Several of these tools provide false positive results or crash the Bash shell. The information provided for each bug ID in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool") identifies the versions of software that contain the fixed code and should be used to determine if a product is vulnerable.  Workarounds  * There are no mitigations for this vulnerability that can be performed directly on affected systems. However, the following network based mitigations may be of use to some customers.   + Cisco Intrusion Protection System (IPS) signature 4689-0 has been created and is available in release S824   + Cisco Sourcefire has published Snort signatures 31975-31977, 31985, 32038-32039, 32041-32043, 32045-32047, and 32049 to detect and protect networks against the Bash vulnerabilityCisco has published an Event Response for this vulnerability:   <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_Bash_09252014.html>       Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=35836>  Fixed Software  * Cisco will be providing software upgrades for vulnerable products. Information regarding the fix, including software versions that contain fixes can be found by referencing the Cisco bug ID from the list of vulnerable products and entering it in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool").      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the release notes of the bug and the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Bash Code Injection Vulnerability via Specially Crafted Environment Variables (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169)

Updated 2014-10-02T15:38:26+00:00 -
English

* [English](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223)
* [Japanese](https://access.redhat.com/ja/articles/1210893)
* [Korean](https://access.redhat.com/ko/articles/1215293)

Red Hat has been made aware of a vulnerability affecting all versions of the bash package as shipped with Red Hat products. This vulnerability [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) could allow for arbitrary code execution. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.

**Update: 2014-09-30 18:00 UTC**

Two new flaws have been reported that are mitigated by the currently available Bash packages. Please refer to [the FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223#faq_six_CVE_assignments) for further information.

**Update: 2014-09-29 05:00 UTC**

Malware is circulating that exploits this vulnerability. For more details, see [this article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1213683).

**Update: 2014-09-26 05:15 UTC**

Red Hat has become aware that the patch for [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) is incomplete. An attacker can provide specially-crafted environment variables containing arbitrary commands that will be executed on vulnerable systems under certain conditions. The new issue has been assigned [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169).

Updated bash packages that address [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support, and Shift\_JIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6. See also [Resolution for Bash Code Injection Vulnerability via Specially Crafted Environment Variables (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/node/1207723).

## Diagnostic Steps

[Red Hat Access Labs has provided a script](https://access.redhat.com/labs/shellshock/) to help confirm if a system is patched against to the Shellshock vulnerability. You can also manually test your version of Bash by running the following command:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"

```

If the output of the above command contains a line containing only the word `vulnerable` you are using a vulnerable version of Bash. The patch used to fix this issue ensures that no code is allowed after the end of a Bash function.

Note that different Bash versions will also print different warnings while executing the above command. The Bash versions without any fix produce the following output:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
vulnerable
bash: BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
bash: BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0: `BASH_FUNC_x() () { :;}; echo vulnerable'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

The versions with only the original CVE-2014-6271 fix applied produce the following output:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x()'
test

```

The versions with additional fixes from [RHSA-2014:1306](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html), [RHSA-2014:1311](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html) and [RHSA-2014:1312](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html) produce the following output:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

The difference in the output is caused by additional function processing changes explained in the "How does this impact systems" section below.

The fix for CVE-2014-7169 ensures that the system is protected from the file creation issue. To test if your version of Bash is vulnerable to CVE-2014-7169, run the following command:

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
bash: x: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `='
bash: x: line 1: `'
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
Fri Sep 26 11:49:58 GMT 2014

```

If your system is vulnerable, the time and date information will be output on the screen and a file called /tmp/echo will be created.

If your system is not vulnerable, you will see output similar to:

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
date
cat: /tmp/echo: No such file or directory

```

If your system is vulnerable, you can fix these issues by updating to the most recent version of the Bash package by running the following command:

```
# yum update bash

```
## How does this impact systems

This issue affects all products which use the Bash shell and parse values of environment variables. This issue is especially dangerous as there are many possible ways Bash can be called by an application. Quite often if an application executes another binary, Bash is invoked to accomplish this. Because of the pervasive use of the Bash shell, this issue is quite serious and should be treated as such.

All versions prior to those listed as updates for this issue are vulnerable to some degree.

See the appropriate remediation article for specifics.

The patch for CVE-2014-7169 introduces changes to how Bash evaluates environment variables. Applications which directly create Bash functions as environment variables need to be made aware of these changes. Previously, a function had to be stored in an environment variable of the same name. For example, the function "compute" would be stored in an environment variable named "compute". With the patch for CVE-2014-7169 applied, it would need to use the name "BASH\_FUNC\_compute()". As a result, there are now two pairs of parentheses in the environment string, as in "BASH\_FUNC\_compute()=() { }".

Functions written in Bash itself do not need to be changed, even if they are exported with "export -f". Bash will transparently apply the appropriate naming when exporting, and reverse the process when importing function definitions.

Services that create such environment variables will need to be restarted to work with the new version of Bash. This behavior is not used by any of the packages provided in any version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### Common Configuration Examples:

Red Hat performed an analysis to better understand the magnitude of this issue and how it affects various configurations. The below list is not exhaustive, but is meant to give some examples of how this issue affects certain configurations, and why the high level of complexity makes it impossible to specify something is not affected by this issue. The best course of action is to upgrade Bash to a fixed version.

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| httpd | CGI scripts are likely affected by this issue: when a CGI script is run by the web server, it uses environment variables to pass data to the script. These environment variables can be controlled by the attacker. If the CGI script calls Bash, the script could execute arbitrary code as the httpd user. mod\_php, mod\_perl, and mod\_python do not use environment variables and we believe they are not affected. |
| Secure Shell (SSH) | It is not uncommon to restrict remote commands that a user can run via SSH, such as rsync or git. In these instances, this issue can be used to execute any command, not just the restricted command. |
| dhclient | The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client (dhclient) is used to automatically obtain network configuration information via DHCP. This client uses various environment variables and runs Bash to configure the network interface. Connecting to a malicious DHCP server could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the client machine. |
| CUPS | It is believed that CUPS is affected by this issue. Various user supplied values are stored in environment variables when cups filters are executed. |
| sudo | Commands run via sudo are not affected by this issue. Sudo specifically looks for environment variables that are also functions. It could still be possible for the running command to set an environment variable that could cause a Bash child process to execute arbitrary code. |
| Firefox | We do not believe Firefox can be forced to set an environment variable in a manner that would allow Bash to run arbitrary commands. It is still advisable to upgrade Bash as it is common to install various plug-ins and extensions that could allow this behavior. |
| Postfix | The Postfix server will replace various characters with a ?. While the Postfix server does call Bash in a variety of ways, we do not believe an arbitrary environment variable can be set by the server. It is however possible that a filter could set environment variables. |

### Why are there six CVE assignments?

The original flaw in Bash was assigned [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271). Shortly after this issue went public, a researcher found a similar flaw that was not blocked by the first fix and this was assigned [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169). Later, Red Hat Product Security researcher Florian Weimer found additional problems and they were assigned [CVE-2014-7186](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186) and [CVE-2014-7187](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7187). Recently, two more flaws were reported, although the details of these flaws are currently non-public, and they were assigned [CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277) and [CVE-2014-6278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278). The first four flaws have been fixed in the latest Bash packages currently available, and the last two flaws are mitigated by the same. As of this writing (2014-09-30) there are currently no known security flaws that these Bash packages are vulnerable to. Please refer to the actual CVE pages noted for the latest statements on these flaws.

### I believe my system may have been compromised due to this vulnerability, what should I do?

If you have run the diagnostic steps in this article, and your system still appears to be vulnerable, or you believe your system has been compromised, [open a support case with Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/new) or [contact Red Hat support by phone](https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/technicalSupport).

### Do I need to reboot or restart services after installing the update for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169?

If your system uses exported Bash functions, restarting affected services is recommended. Affected interactive users may have to re-login, and screen or tmux sessions may need to be restarted.

The Bash update provided to fix these issues changes the names of exported functions in the environment. If a function is exported by the old version of Bash, it is not recognized by newly started Bash processes after the update, and essentially becomes undefined. Restarting the services ensures that the new version of Bash exports functions under the expected name, making it visible again.

To find out which services need to be restarted (or which users have to re-login), execute the following command after updating:

```
$ grep -l -z '[^)]=() {' /proc/[1-9]*/environ | cut -d/ -f3
```

The returned PIDs belong to processes which are using the old exported function definitions in their environment. These processes must be restarted. To discover which service started a certain PID and needs restarting, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, use the following command:

```
$ systemctl status <PID>
```

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier, use the `pstree -p` or `ps -axuf` command and look for a particular PID.

### Are other shells vulnerable to this issue?

Red Hat has tested other shells for this issue. We could not reproduce the behavior seen in Bash. If similar issues are discovered in other shells we will release updates as appropriate.

### Are there any possible mitigations against this issue?

Please see [Mitigating the shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169)](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1212303) for details on potential mitigations if you are unable to install the updated packages. The best mitigation is to install the latest available packages (noted above) as they currently protect against all reported vulnerabilities.

### Statement on Red Hat Website Vulnerability

The following Red Hat websites, which provide services to customers have been confirmed to be updated:

* www.redhat.com
* access.redhat.com (Red Hat Customer Portal)
* rhn.redhat.com (Red Hat Network)

Red Hat utilises Salesforce to deliver services to customers. Salesforce have [released a statement](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.salesforce.com%2Fapex%2FHTViewSolution%3Furlname%3DShellshock-Vulnerability-CVE-2014-6271-impact-on-Salesforce-com%26language%3Den_US) that it has determined Salesforce services are not vulnerable to this issue.

Red Hat has observed unsuccessful attempts to exploit this vulnerability against the above websites. We continue to monitor our systems to ensure their confidentiality, integrity and availability.

NOTE: HP strongly recommends implementing the following security best
practices to help reduce both known and future security vulnerability risks:

Isolate the HP Integrity Server's management network by keeping it separate
from the data or production network, and not connecting it directly to the
Internet without additional access authentication.
Patch and maintain Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and web
servers.
Use virus scanners, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and
vulnerability scanners regularly.
Apply all recommended HP Firmware updates.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1294)

## Topic

Updated bash packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support, Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support,
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The GNU Bourne Again shell (Bash) is a shell and command language
interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell (sh). Bash is the default
shell for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain
services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.
(CVE-2014-6271)

For additional information on the CVE-2014-6271 flaw, refer to the
Knowledgebase article at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223>

Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting this issue.

All bash users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

## Here When You Need Us

# Security Vulnerability : GNU Bash Remote Code Execution (aka ShellShock)

This document **(7015702)** is provided subject to the [disclaimer](#disclaimer) at the end of this document.

### Environment

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP2 LTSS
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 LTSS
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4 LTSS
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP3 LTSS
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP3
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP3
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3 for VMware
SLES Expanded Support platform release 6.5
SLES Expanded Support platform release 5.10

### Situation

SUSE has been made aware of a vulnerability affecting all versions of the bash package, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment (CVE-2014-6271 & CVE-2014-7169 ). Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.
### Resolution

There are several options that may be used to fix this issue:

**1.  Updating your entire system with the latest system updates:**

To make sure that you have the patches relative to these issues, update the complete system to the latest patch level (preferred option) by running the following commands from a terminal, after verifying that you have your patch channels configured:

* zypper ref -s
* zypper up

SUSE recommends that you always apply updates and consider running the latest version.

You can verify your current version by typing at a command prompt:

cat /etc/\*release

For more information on how to upgrade can be found in [TID 7012368.](http://https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7012368)

**2.  Apply only the latest bash patches**

If you prefer to update only the bash patches, use the following commands:

* zypper ref -s
* zypper up bash

**3.  Updating an Expanded Support Platform**

In case of SLES Expanded Support platform:

* yum update

**4. Applying CVE related fixes if you don't have LTSS maintenance:**

Due to the nature of this issue, it was decided that patches would be made available to active subscription customers who don't have an LTSS agreement and are on SLES10SPx and SLES11SP1/SP2.  Some patches have already been released on (details below): <https://download.suse.com/patch/finder/>

If you can not find the downloads for your OS version please contact Customer Support.

**Note**: On Patchfinder you need to select the LTSS equivalent of your product. For example if you are on SLES 10 SP3, you will need to search under SLES 10 SP3 LTSS to find the patch. Your current SLES entitlement will allow access to these files.

Please note that the exploit test of CVE-2014-6277 mentioned on "shellshocker.net" is NOT valid for SLES systems that have been patched. The segmentation fault is certainly not nice, but note that the function was defined in the shell itself, not passed via an environment variable. Bugs in the evaluation code are not mitigated by the hardening patch, but they no longer have the potential to be abused.

SUPPORT COMMUNICATION - SECURITY BULLETIN

Document ID: c04467807
Version: 1

HPSBGN03117 rev.1 - HP Remote Device Access: Virtual Customer Access System
(vCAS) running Bash Shell, Remote Code Execution

NOTICE: The information in this Security Bulletin should be acted upon as
soon as possible.

Release Date: 2014-09-30
Last Updated: 2014-09-30

Potential Security Impact: Remote code execution

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP Remote Device
Access: Virtual Customer Access System (vCAS) running Bash Shell . This is
the Bash Shell vulnerability known as "ShellShock" which could be exploited
remotely to allow execution of code.

    NOTE: The vCAS product is vulnerable only if DHCP is enabled.

References:

CVE-2014-6271
CVE-2014-7169
SSRT101724

SUPPORTED SOFTWARE VERSIONS*: ONLY impacted versions are listed.

vCAS version 14.06 (RDA 8.1)

===========================================================
             Information on CVSS is documented
            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

HP is actively working to address this vulnerability for the impacted product
versions of HP Remote Device Access: Virtual Customer Access System (vCAS)
running Bash Shell. This bulletin will be revised when the software update is
released.

NOTE: HP recommends to not power-down or disconnect the vCAS until the update
is available.

MITIGATION INFORMATION

A Shellshock attack requires the definition of an environment variable
introduced into Bash. The vCAS has three attack vectors: SSH, the lighttpd
web server, and the DHCP client.

  - The exploit does not elevate privileges.
  - The SSH and webserver exploits require vCAS credentials so there is no
risk for unauthorized access or code execution through this vulnerability.

The DHCP client uses Bash scripts and is vulnerable to Shellshock. The DHCP
exploit can be mitigated by ensuring that DHCP is disabled on the vCAS.

  Note: HP strongly discourages the use of DHCP on the vCAS.

The web UI forces the vCAS user to assign a static IP address and change the
hp-admin password. A vCAS user must manually configure DHCP for use on the
vCAS.

A vCAS user can verify that DHCP is disabled by inspecting the file
"/etc/network/interfaces" and ensuring that the "iface" line for device
"eth0" is set for a static IP.

  Example of a static IP configuration:

    # The primary network interface
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 172.27.1.68
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 172.27.1.1

#### *This article was originally published on the Red Hat Customer Portal. The information may no longer be current.*

The recent few days have been hectic for everyone who works in the Linux/Unix world. Bash security flaws have rocked the globe leaving people confused, worried, or just frustrated. Now that the storm is over and patches are available for most operating systems, here are the answers to some of the common questions we've been asked:

## Why are there four CVE assignments?

The original flaw in Bash was assigned CVE-2014-6271. Shortly after that issue went public a researcher found a similar flaw that wasn't blocked by the first fix and this was assigned CVE-2014-7169. Later, Red Hat Product Security researcher Florian Weimer found additional problems and they were assigned CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187. It's possible that other issues will be found in the future and assigned a CVE designator even if they are blocked by the existing patches.

## Is CVE-2014-7169 the same severity as the original flaw?

Our research, and that of [others,](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html) shows that it would not have been possible to exploit the CVE-2014-7169 flaw remotely in the same way that it was for the previous flaw. So, even though there were security consequences of the CVE-2014-7169 flaw, it was certainly not as severe as the original flaw.

## Why did Red Hat delay in providing a patch for CVE-2014-7169?

When a second issue with Bash was found a few minutes after the first one went public, we knew there was something wrong. We could have followed a duct-tape approach and issued patches to our customers quickly or we could have done this correctly. Applying multiple security updates is extremely difficult!

When CVE-2014-7169 went public, there was a lot of visible confusion around how to address this issue. This was fueled by the media and by the fact that exploits were immediately available on the Internet.

Red Hat carefully analyzed the root cause of the issue and wrote and tested patches. We posted these patches to the community for review and allowing everyone to freely use them if they wanted to. Doing things correctly takes time!

## Why is Red Hat using a different patch then others?

Our patch addresses the CVE-2014-7169 issue in a much better way than the upstream patch, we wanted to make sure the issue was properly dealt with.

## I have deployed web application filters to block CVE-2014-6271. Are these filters also effective against the subsequent flaws?

If configured properly and applied to all relevant places, the "() {" signature will work against these additional flaws.

## Does SELinux help protect against this flaw?

SELinux can help reduce the impact of some of the exploits for this issue. SELinux guru Dan Walsh has written about this in depth in [his blog](http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/71122.html).

## Are you aware of any new ways to exploit this issue?

Within a few hours of the first issue being public (CVE-2014-6271), various exploits were seen live, they attacked the services we identified at risk in our first post: from dhclient, CGI serving web servers, sshd+ForceCommand configuration, git repositories. We did not see any exploits which were targeted at servers which had the first issue fixed, but were affected by the second issue. We are currently not aware of any exploits which target bash packages which have both CVE patches applied.

## Why wasn't this flaw noticed sooner?

The flaws in Bash were in a quite obscure feature that was rarely used; it is not surprising that this code had not been given much attention. When the first flaw was discovered it was reported responsibly to vendors who worked over a period of under 2 weeks to address the issue.

## Did you have an outage?

Our security blog article was widely regarded as the definitive source of information about the flaw, being referenced in news articles, on Wikipedia, and from organizations such as US-CERT. This caused more demand than we expected so we did have some periods on Thursday where the blog was unavailable. Our customer portal also had some problems keeping up with demand at times. Many of the issues we saw have already been corrected.

## Is my lightbulb really affected by these flaws?

Only if your lightbulb runs Bash! Lots of press have latched onto the fact that this flaw could affect the Internet Of Things, allowing attackers to take control of your systems via home appliances. In reality, embedded devices rarely use Bash, going for more lightweight solutions such as BusyBox, which includes the ash shell that was not vulnerable to these issues. So while it's certainly plausible that some devices may be affected by this flaw, it won't be very common.

# Bash Code Injection Vulnerability via Specially Crafted Environment Variables (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169)

Updated 2014-10-02T15:38:26+00:00 -
English

* [English](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223)
* [Japanese](https://access.redhat.com/ja/articles/1210893)
* [Korean](https://access.redhat.com/ko/articles/1215293)

Red Hat has been made aware of a vulnerability affecting all versions of the bash package as shipped with Red Hat products. This vulnerability [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) could allow for arbitrary code execution. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.

**Update: 2014-09-30 18:00 UTC**

Two new flaws have been reported that are mitigated by the currently available Bash packages. Please refer to [the FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223#faq_six_CVE_assignments) for further information.

**Update: 2014-09-29 05:00 UTC**

Malware is circulating that exploits this vulnerability. For more details, see [this article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1213683).

**Update: 2014-09-26 05:15 UTC**

Red Hat has become aware that the patch for [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) is incomplete. An attacker can provide specially-crafted environment variables containing arbitrary commands that will be executed on vulnerable systems under certain conditions. The new issue has been assigned [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169).

Updated bash packages that address [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support, and Shift\_JIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6. See also [Resolution for Bash Code Injection Vulnerability via Specially Crafted Environment Variables (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/node/1207723).

## Diagnostic Steps

[Red Hat Access Labs has provided a script](https://access.redhat.com/labs/shellshock/) to help confirm if a system is patched against to the Shellshock vulnerability. You can also manually test your version of Bash by running the following command:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"

```

If the output of the above command contains a line containing only the word `vulnerable` you are using a vulnerable version of Bash. The patch used to fix this issue ensures that no code is allowed after the end of a Bash function.

Note that different Bash versions will also print different warnings while executing the above command. The Bash versions without any fix produce the following output:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
vulnerable
bash: BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
bash: BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0: `BASH_FUNC_x() () { :;}; echo vulnerable'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

The versions with only the original CVE-2014-6271 fix applied produce the following output:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x()'
test

```

The versions with additional fixes from [RHSA-2014:1306](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html), [RHSA-2014:1311](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html) and [RHSA-2014:1312](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html) produce the following output:

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

The difference in the output is caused by additional function processing changes explained in the "How does this impact systems" section below.

The fix for CVE-2014-7169 ensures that the system is protected from the file creation issue. To test if your version of Bash is vulnerable to CVE-2014-7169, run the following command:

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
bash: x: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `='
bash: x: line 1: `'
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
Fri Sep 26 11:49:58 GMT 2014

```

If your system is vulnerable, the time and date information will be output on the screen and a file called /tmp/echo will be created.

If your system is not vulnerable, you will see output similar to:

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
date
cat: /tmp/echo: No such file or directory

```

If your system is vulnerable, you can fix these issues by updating to the most recent version of the Bash package by running the following command:

```
# yum update bash

```
## How does this impact systems

This issue affects all products which use the Bash shell and parse values of environment variables. This issue is especially dangerous as there are many possible ways Bash can be called by an application. Quite often if an application executes another binary, Bash is invoked to accomplish this. Because of the pervasive use of the Bash shell, this issue is quite serious and should be treated as such.

All versions prior to those listed as updates for this issue are vulnerable to some degree.

See the appropriate remediation article for specifics.

The patch for CVE-2014-7169 introduces changes to how Bash evaluates environment variables. Applications which directly create Bash functions as environment variables need to be made aware of these changes. Previously, a function had to be stored in an environment variable of the same name. For example, the function "compute" would be stored in an environment variable named "compute". With the patch for CVE-2014-7169 applied, it would need to use the name "BASH\_FUNC\_compute()". As a result, there are now two pairs of parentheses in the environment string, as in "BASH\_FUNC\_compute()=() { }".

Functions written in Bash itself do not need to be changed, even if they are exported with "export -f". Bash will transparently apply the appropriate naming when exporting, and reverse the process when importing function definitions.

Services that create such environment variables will need to be restarted to work with the new version of Bash. This behavior is not used by any of the packages provided in any version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

### Common Configuration Examples:

Red Hat performed an analysis to better understand the magnitude of this issue and how it affects various configurations. The below list is not exhaustive, but is meant to give some examples of how this issue affects certain configurations, and why the high level of complexity makes it impossible to specify something is not affected by this issue. The best course of action is to upgrade Bash to a fixed version.

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| httpd | CGI scripts are likely affected by this issue: when a CGI script is run by the web server, it uses environment variables to pass data to the script. These environment variables can be controlled by the attacker. If the CGI script calls Bash, the script could execute arbitrary code as the httpd user. mod\_php, mod\_perl, and mod\_python do not use environment variables and we believe they are not affected. |
| Secure Shell (SSH) | It is not uncommon to restrict remote commands that a user can run via SSH, such as rsync or git. In these instances, this issue can be used to execute any command, not just the restricted command. |
| dhclient | The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client (dhclient) is used to automatically obtain network configuration information via DHCP. This client uses various environment variables and runs Bash to configure the network interface. Connecting to a malicious DHCP server could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the client machine. |
| CUPS | It is believed that CUPS is affected by this issue. Various user supplied values are stored in environment variables when cups filters are executed. |
| sudo | Commands run via sudo are not affected by this issue. Sudo specifically looks for environment variables that are also functions. It could still be possible for the running command to set an environment variable that could cause a Bash child process to execute arbitrary code. |
| Firefox | We do not believe Firefox can be forced to set an environment variable in a manner that would allow Bash to run arbitrary commands. It is still advisable to upgrade Bash as it is common to install various plug-ins and extensions that could allow this behavior. |
| Postfix | The Postfix server will replace various characters with a ?. While the Postfix server does call Bash in a variety of ways, we do not believe an arbitrary environment variable can be set by the server. It is however possible that a filter could set environment variables. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

This FAQ is for the vulnerability CVE-2014-6271 in Bash.

Some additional information regarding CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169 is available at: <https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/09/26/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-shellshock-bash-flaws/>

Some additional information regarding customers who have RHEL 4 Standard or Premium Entitlements, but not ELS, is available at <https://access.redhat.com/discussions/1211573>

### Why are there six CVE assignments?

The original flaw in Bash was assigned [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271). Shortly after this issue went public, a researcher found a similar flaw that was not blocked by the first fix and this was assigned [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169). Later, Red Hat Product Security researcher Florian Weimer found additional problems and they were assigned [CVE-2014-7186](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186) and [CVE-2014-7187](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7187). Recently, two more flaws were reported, although the details of these flaws are currently non-public, and they were assigned [CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277) and [CVE-2014-6278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278). The first four flaws have been fixed in the latest Bash packages currently available, and the last two flaws are mitigated by the same. As of this writing (2014-09-30) there are currently no known security flaws that these Bash packages are vulnerable to. Please refer to the actual CVE pages noted for the latest statements on these flaws.

### I believe my system may have been compromised due to this vulnerability, what should I do?

If you have run the diagnostic steps in this article, and your system still appears to be vulnerable, or you believe your system has been compromised, [open a support case with Red Hat](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/new) or [contact Red Hat support by phone](https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/technicalSupport).

### Do I need to reboot or restart services after installing the update for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169?

If your system uses exported Bash functions, restarting affected services is recommended. Affected interactive users may have to re-login, and screen or tmux sessions may need to be restarted.

The Bash update provided to fix these issues changes the names of exported functions in the environment. If a function is exported by the old version of Bash, it is not recognized by newly started Bash processes after the update, and essentially becomes undefined. Restarting the services ensures that the new version of Bash exports functions under the expected name, making it visible again.

To find out which services need to be restarted (or which users have to re-login), execute the following command after updating:

```
$ grep -l -z '[^)]=() {' /proc/[1-9]*/environ | cut -d/ -f3
```

The returned PIDs belong to processes which are using the old exported function definitions in their environment. These processes must be restarted. To discover which service started a certain PID and needs restarting, on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, use the following command:

```
$ systemctl status <PID>
```

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier, use the `pstree -p` or `ps -axuf` command and look for a particular PID.

### Are other shells vulnerable to this issue?

Red Hat has tested other shells for this issue. We could not reproduce the behavior seen in Bash. If similar issues are discovered in other shells we will release updates as appropriate.

### Are there any possible mitigations against this issue?

Please see [Mitigating the shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169)](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1212303) for details on potential mitigations if you are unable to install the updated packages. The best mitigation is to install the latest available packages (noted above) as they currently protect against all reported vulnerabilities.

### Statement on Red Hat Website Vulnerability

The following Red Hat websites, which provide services to customers have been confirmed to be updated:

* www.redhat.com
* access.redhat.com (Red Hat Customer Portal)
* rhn.redhat.com (Red Hat Network)

Red Hat utilises Salesforce to deliver services to customers. Salesforce have [released a statement](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.salesforce.com%2Fapex%2FHTViewSolution%3Furlname%3DShellshock-Vulnerability-CVE-2014-6271-impact-on-Salesforce-com%26language%3Den_US) that it has determined Salesforce services are not vulnerable to this issue.

Red Hat has observed unsuccessful attempts to exploit this vulnerability against the above websites. We continue to monitor our systems to ensure their confidentiality, integrity and availability.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## GNU Bash shell executes commands in exported functions in environment variables

#### Vulnerability Note VU#252743

Original Release Date: 2014-09-25 | Last Revised: 2015-04-14

---

### Overview

GNU Bash 4.3 and earlier contains a command injection vulnerability that may allow remote code execution.

### Description

| UPDATE: New CVE-IDs added for incomplete patches. Additional resources added and vendor patch information updated.  [**CWE-78**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html)**: OS Command Injection**Bash supports exporting of shell functions to other instances of bash using an environment variable. This environment variable is named by the function name and starts with a "() {" as the variable value in the function definition. When Bash reaches the end of the function definition, rather than ending execution it continues to process shell commands written after the end of the function. This vulnerability is especially critical because Bash is widespread on many types of devices (UNIX-like operating systems including Linux and Mac OS X), and because many network services utilize Bash, causing the vulnerability to be network exploitable. Any service or program that sets environment variables controlled by an attacker and calls Bash may be vulnerable.Red Hat has developed the following test:$ env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"The website [shellshocker.net](https://shellshocker.net/) from the health IT team at Medical Informatics Engineering has developed several tests for websites and hosts and includes update information. This vulnerability is being actively exploited. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A malicious attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code at the privilege level of the calling application. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**The first several set of patches (for CVE-2014-6271) do not completely resolve the vulnerability. CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-7186, and CVE 2014-7187 identify the remaining aspects of this vulnerability. Red Hat has provided a [support article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223) with updated information and workarounds.CERT/CC has also included vendor patch information below when notified of an update. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| Many UNIX-like operating systems, including Linux distributions and Apple Mac OS X include Bash and are likely to be vulnerable. Contact your vendor for information about updates or patches. This Red Hat [support article](https://access.redhat.com/node/1200223) and [blog post](https://access.redhat.com/node/1200223) describe ways that Bash can be called from other programs, including network vectors such as CGI, SSH, and DHCP. [Shell Shock Exploitation Vectors](https://www.dfranke.us/posts/2014-09-27-shell-shock-exploitation-vectors.html) describes other ways this vulnerability could be exploited. |

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Information contained below is subject to change due to the evolving nature of
CVE-reported information & available fixes.

"ShellShock" CVE-2014-6271 & CVE-2014-7169 are now resolved in software patches
made available via NIKSUN SupportNet. NIKSUN has now produced software updates
for all supported product lines. We continue to observe activity on the NSON
(NIKSUN Security Observation Network) to produce current threat detections â€“
more signatures may be released as we continuously observe behavior globally.
Current signatures should be downloaded & installed, available via SupportNet,
to get the most out of your NIKSUN security products.

The BASH component defect affecting the community-at-large is serious, but
unlike the Heartbleed defect, which generically affected many publically
available products in exactly the same way, Shellshock requires a specific set
of conditions to exist for exploitation.

NIKSUN is both a contributor to the open source community as well as a consumer
and is leveraging those relationships to bring this issue to a satisfactory
close.

"ShellShock" CVE-2014-6271 & CVE-2014-7169 are now resolved in software patches
made available via NIKSUN SupportNet. NIKSUN has now produced software updates
for all supported product lines, with additional work in progress on breaking
CVEs related to ShellShock exposed in the last few days â€“ software currently
in a quality assurance cycle will become available this week for remaining CVEs
associated with ShellShock now that the global community has agreed on a
sustainable, supportable fix. We continue to observe activity on the NSON
(NIKSUN Security Observation Network) to produce current threat detections with
more signatures released as we continuously observe behavior globally. Current
signatures should be downloaded & installed, available via SupportNet, to get
the most out of your NIKSUN security products.

NIKSUN is committed to providing a rapid resolution to this issue while
ensuring quality, stability & completeness of a fix.

Currently we have already patched CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169 in the FreeBSD ports tree, making it no longer vulnerable to these two issues. We will patch the new issues once the fix is validated.

The FreeBSD base system do not use bash at all and is therefore not affected.

# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in Bash affect IBM PureApplication System (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Six Bash vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014. This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock” and two memory corruption vulnerabilities. Bash is used by IBM PureApplication System.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID**: [CVE-2014-6271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

## Affected Products and Versions

* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.0 and later fix packs
* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.1 and later fix packs
* IBM PureApplication System Version 2.0 and later fix packs

## Remediation/Fixes

The solution is to apply the fixes with the following direction:

**PureSystems Managers:**

The PureSystems Managers on all IBM PureApplication System versions are affected. Upgrade the IBM PureApplication System to the following interim Fix (iFix) levels:

* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.0 and later fix packs:

+ Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V1.0.0.4 iFix 9

* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.1 and later fix packs:

+ Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V1.1.0.4 iFix 4

* IBM PureApplication System Version 2.0 and later fix packs:

+ Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V2.0.0.0 iFix 2

**Deployed Virtual Machines:**

Deployed AIX virtual machines are not affected. Upgrade all deployed Red Hat Linux virtual machines by using an emergency fix (eFix) provided by IBM:

* Download the eFix from IBM Fix Central (see the following link):

<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=RedHat_Image_Bash_Vulnerability&includeSupersedes=0>

* Import the eFix into the IBM PureApplication System Emergency Fix catalog.

* Apply this Emergency Fix on each deployed Red Hat Linux virtual machine. Bash is upgraded to version bash-4.1.2-15.e16\_5.2.

**Images:**

For images, you can use the new default image, or you can extend and capture the existing image by using the following general procedure:

* Import the eFix into the IBM Workload Deployer Emergency Fix catalog.

* From the image catalog, select the image and click "Extend."

* After the image extend operation completes succcessfully, click Service from the deployed virtual machine.

* Apply this emergency fix.

* From the image catalog, capture the image.

Use this newly captured image for future deployment.

#### *This article was originally published on the Red Hat Customer Portal. The information may no longer be current.*

The recent few days have been hectic for everyone who works in the Linux/Unix world. Bash security flaws have rocked the globe leaving people confused, worried, or just frustrated. Now that the storm is over and patches are available for most operating systems, here are the answers to some of the common questions we've been asked:

## Why are there four CVE assignments?

The original flaw in Bash was assigned CVE-2014-6271. Shortly after that issue went public a researcher found a similar flaw that wasn't blocked by the first fix and this was assigned CVE-2014-7169. Later, Red Hat Product Security researcher Florian Weimer found additional problems and they were assigned CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187. It's possible that other issues will be found in the future and assigned a CVE designator even if they are blocked by the existing patches.

## Is CVE-2014-7169 the same severity as the original flaw?

Our research, and that of [others,](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.co.uk/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html) shows that it would not have been possible to exploit the CVE-2014-7169 flaw remotely in the same way that it was for the previous flaw. So, even though there were security consequences of the CVE-2014-7169 flaw, it was certainly not as severe as the original flaw.

## Why did Red Hat delay in providing a patch for CVE-2014-7169?

When a second issue with Bash was found a few minutes after the first one went public, we knew there was something wrong. We could have followed a duct-tape approach and issued patches to our customers quickly or we could have done this correctly. Applying multiple security updates is extremely difficult!

When CVE-2014-7169 went public, there was a lot of visible confusion around how to address this issue. This was fueled by the media and by the fact that exploits were immediately available on the Internet.

Red Hat carefully analyzed the root cause of the issue and wrote and tested patches. We posted these patches to the community for review and allowing everyone to freely use them if they wanted to. Doing things correctly takes time!

## Why is Red Hat using a different patch then others?

Our patch addresses the CVE-2014-7169 issue in a much better way than the upstream patch, we wanted to make sure the issue was properly dealt with.

## I have deployed web application filters to block CVE-2014-6271. Are these filters also effective against the subsequent flaws?

If configured properly and applied to all relevant places, the "() {" signature will work against these additional flaws.

## Does SELinux help protect against this flaw?

SELinux can help reduce the impact of some of the exploits for this issue. SELinux guru Dan Walsh has written about this in depth in [his blog](http://danwalsh.livejournal.com/71122.html).

## Are you aware of any new ways to exploit this issue?

Within a few hours of the first issue being public (CVE-2014-6271), various exploits were seen live, they attacked the services we identified at risk in our first post: from dhclient, CGI serving web servers, sshd+ForceCommand configuration, git repositories. We did not see any exploits which were targeted at servers which had the first issue fixed, but were affected by the second issue. We are currently not aware of any exploits which target bash packages which have both CVE patches applied.

## Why wasn't this flaw noticed sooner?

The flaws in Bash were in a quite obscure feature that was rarely used; it is not surprising that this code had not been given much attention. When the first flaw was discovered it was reported responsibly to vendors who worked over a period of under 2 weeks to address the issue.

## Did you have an outage?

Our security blog article was widely regarded as the definitive source of information about the flaw, being referenced in news articles, on Wikipedia, and from organizations such as US-CERT. This caused more demand than we expected so we did have some periods on Thursday where the blog was unavailable. Our customer portal also had some problems keeping up with demand at times. Many of the issues we saw have already been corrected.

## Is my lightbulb really affected by these flaws?

Only if your lightbulb runs Bash! Lots of press have latched onto the fact that this flaw could affect the Internet Of Things, allowing attackers to take control of your systems via home appliances. In reality, embedded devices rarely use Bash, going for more lightweight solutions such as BusyBox, which includes the ash shell that was not vulnerable to these issues. So while it's certainly plausible that some devices may be affected by this flaw, it won't be very common.

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1293)

## Topic

Updated bash packages that fix one security issue are now available for Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The GNU Bourne Again shell (Bash) is a shell and command language
interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell (sh). Bash is the default
shell for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain
services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.
(CVE-2014-6271)

For additional information on the CVE-2014-6271 flaw, refer to the
Knowledgebase article at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223>

Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting this issue.

All bash users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

### NOVICE OR INDUSTRY PROFESSIONAL, WE TEACH YOU TO

## THINK LIKE YOUR ATTACKER

The fast evolution and constant threat of cyber attacks, our ever-growing reliance upon digital processes, and the exponential increase in online data makes cyber security one of the greatest challenges of our time. Despite this, few are equipped with the necessary skills to tackle it. Hacker House was created to close the skills gap quickly, efficiently and effectively. Taught by world-renowned ethical hackers, our students are plunged head-first into real world cyber-attack simulations and are assessed across a variety of practical assignments designed to cover every angle. In short, we teach students how to think, act and move like a hacker – and then outmanoeuvre them. We provide technical resources to assist companies in understanding the complex cyber threat theatre. From computer hacking, electronic surveillance, counter measures, espionage, exploits and malicious code.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

# BEAM & RSSMON are Webmin based configuration utilities
# that ship with RSS server 3.0. These packages are the
# recommended GUI configuration components and listen on
# a user specified port from 10000/tcp to 65535/tcp. They
# are accessible on the local host only in vanilla install
# unless the firewall is disabled. Both services run with
# full root permissions and can be exploited for LPE or
# network attacks. RSSMON has hardened SELinux policies
# applied which hinder exploitation of this vulnerability
# be limiting access to network resources. Commands are
# still run as root in a blind way.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Bash update for multiple products.

Bash libraries have been updated in multiple products to resolve multiple critical security issues, also referred to as Shellshock.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifiers CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, and CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278 to these issues.

VMware products have been grouped into the following four product categories:

**I) ESXi and ESX Hypervisor**
ESXi is not affected because ESXi uses the Ash shell (through busybox), which is not affected by the vulnerability reported for the Bash shell. ESX has an affected version of the Bash shell.
See table 1 for remediation for ESX.

**II) Windows-based products**
Windows-based products, including all versions of vCenter Server running on Windows, are not affected.

**III) VMware (virtual) appliances**
VMware (virtual) appliances ship with an affected version of Bash.
See table 2 for remediation for appliances.

**IV) Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding virtual appliances)**
Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding virtual appliances) might use the Bash shell that is part of the operating system. If the operating system has a vulnerable version of Bash, the Bash security vulnerability might be exploited through the product. VMware recommends that customers contact their operating system vendor for a patch.

MITIGATIONS

VMware encourages restricting access to appliances through firewall rules and other network layer controls to only trusted IP addresses. This measure will greatly reduce any risk to these appliances.

RECOMMENDATIONS

VMware recommends customers evaluate and deploy patches for affected products in Table 1 and 2 below as these patches become available.

For several products, both a patch and a product update are available. In general, if a patch is made available, the patch must be applied to the latest version of the appliance.

Customers should refer to the specific product Knowledge Base articles listed in Section 4 to understand the type of remediation available and applicable appliance version numbers.

Column 4 of the following tables lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Invalid CVSS vector, please try again with a valid CVSS vector.

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV/E:/RL:/RC:/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Updated bash packages fix CVE-2014-6271

Publication date: 24 Sep 2014

Modification date: 24 Sep 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-6271](CVE-2014-6271.html)

## Description

```
Updated bash packages fix security vulnerability:

A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain
services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue
(CVE-2014-6271).

Bash has been updated version 4.2 patch level 37 to patch level 48 to fix
this issue, as well as several other bugs.  See the upstream patches for
details on the other bugs.

This vulnerability can be exposed and exploited through several other
pieces of software and should be considered highly critical.  Please refer
to the RedHat Knowledge Base article and blog post for more information.

All users and sysadmins are advised to update their bash package immediately.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c0)  Wade Mealing    2014-09-15 02:24:57 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the bash functionality that evaluates specially formatted environment variables passed to it from another environment.  An attacker could use this feature to override or bypass restrictions to the environment to execute shell commands before restrictions have been applied.  Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c3)  Huzaifa S.

The import of functions from the environment is a GNU bash-only feature. Neither zsh nor mksh support this.  The format GNU bash uses is that, if an imported variable begins with “() {”, it’s taken as function. For every other shell, these are just normal strings.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c33)  Björn Puttmann    2014-09-25 12:16:23 UTC  ``` You are absolutely correct.

Yes, that is one of the CVEs that Red Hat builds are already immune to, by virtue of moving the function exports out of the regular variable namespace.  >  > See >  > <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.de/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html>  That blog is recommending that other distros and upstream bash follow Red Hat's lead.  >  > It seems to be recommended at this stage to kill the feature from orbit. >  > See <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13>  That is the patch Red Hat used to avoid ALL parser bugs becoming Shell Shock exploit avenues.  You do NOT need to kill function exporting, only kill the confusion of a regular variable being mistaken for a function export, which Red Hat has done.   ```  [Comment 55](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c55)  Peter Backes    2014-09-27 22:48:51 UTC  ``` Thanks Eric for clarification   ```  [Comment 56](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c56)  Mark Casey    2014-09-29 04:16:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Eric Blake from [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c47)) > (In reply to Fabio S.

Eric,  I'm testing upstream bash 4.3.27, built from source, and your method from [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c47) still includes 'vulnerable' in the output. However, none of the individual tests I can find for the CVEs I'm aware of seem to fail on their own - so I am a bit confused.  As far as I can tell I am passing everything from [ <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223> ], and also clear of the tests in your message at [ <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2014-09/msg00238.html> ]  Here is the console output of running the test from [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c47):  > testuser@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ bash --version > GNU bash, version 4.3.27(1)-release (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) > Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc. > License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <<http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>> >  > This is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it. > There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law. > testuser@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ cd /tmp && rm -f /tmp/echo && \ > >      env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'f=() { (a)=>\' \ > >      bash -c 'echo echo vulnerable'; cat echo > echo vulnerable > cat: echo: No such file or directory > testuser@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:/tmp$  I'm wondering if I'm simply failing to make a distinction between a line that says 'echo vulnerable' and a line that literally just says 'vulnerable'.(?)

## Synopsis

Critical: rhev-hypervisor6 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1354)

## Topic

An updated rhev-hypervisor6 package that fixes several security issues is
now available.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization
Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor
is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes
everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: a subset of the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise
Virtualization Agent.

Note: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for
the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.

A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain services
and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide
environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue. (CVE-2014-6271)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2014-6271 was incomplete, and Bash still
allowed certain characters to be injected into other environments via
specially crafted environment variables. An attacker could potentially use
this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell
commands. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated
attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this
issue. (CVE-2014-7169)

A flaw was found in the way NSS parsed ASN.1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One)
input from certain RSA signatures. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
forge RSA certificates by providing a specially crafted signature to an
application using NSS. (CVE-2014-1568)

It was discovered that the fixed-sized redir\_stack could be forced to
overflow in the Bash parser, resulting in memory corruption, and possibly
leading to arbitrary code execution when evaluating untrusted input that
would not otherwise be run as code. (CVE-2014-7186)

An off-by-one error was discovered in the way Bash was handling deeply
nested flow control constructs. Depending on the layout of the .bss
segment, this could allow arbitrary execution of code that would not
otherwise be executed by Bash. (CVE-2014-7187)

Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting CVE-2014-6271,
and the Mozilla project for reporting CVE-2014-1568. Upstream acknowledges
Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Intel Product Security Incident Response Team
as the original reporters of CVE-2014-1568. The CVE-2014-7186 and
CVE-2014-7187 issues were discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
Security.

Users of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to
upgrade to this updated package.

## Solution

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

# CVE-2014-6277

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6272.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6278.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6277 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6277)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access, and untrusted-pointer read and write operations) via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# About OS X bash Update 1.0

This document describes the security content of OS X bash Update 1.0.

This update can be downloaded from the [Apple Support website](https://support.apple.com/en_US/downloads).

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see [How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620).

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see [Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222).

## OS X bash Update 1.0

* **Bash**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.5, OS X Lion Server v10.7.5, OS X Mountain Lion v10.8.5, OS X Mavericks v10.9.5

  Impact: In certain configurations, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary shell commands

  Description: An issue existed in Bash's parsing of environment variables. This issue was addressed through improved environment variable parsing by better detecting the end of the function statement.

  This update also incorporated the suggested CVE-2014-7169 change, which resets the parser state.

  In addition, this update added a new namespace for exported functions by creating a function decorator to prevent unintended header passthrough to Bash. The names of all environment variables that introduce function definitions are required to have a prefix "\_\_BASH\_FUNC<" and suffix ">()" to prevent unintended function passing via HTTP headers.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2014-6271 : Stephane Chazelas

  CVE-2014-7169 : Tavis Ormandy

# TrendMicro InterScan Web Security Virtul Appliance
# ==================================================
# InterScan Web Security is a software virtual appliance that
# dynamically protects against the ever-growing flood of web
# threats at the Internet gateway exclusively designed to secure
# you against traditional and emerging web threats at the Internet
# gateway. The appliance however is shipped with a vulnerable
# version of Bash susceptible to shellshock (I know right?). An
# attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the CGI
# shellscript "/cgi-bin/cgiCmdNotify" which can be exploited
# to perform arbitrary code execution. A limitation of this
# vulnerability is that the attacker must have credentials for
# the admin web interface to exploit this flaw. The panel runs
# over HTTP by default so a man-in-the-middle attack could be
# used to gain credentials and compromise the appliance.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

openSUSE Security Update: Important security fix for bash that allows the injection of commands.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1238-1
Rating: important
References: #896776
Cross-References: CVE-2014-6271
Affected Products:
openSUSE Evergreen 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
This update fixes a bug in the bash shell that allows an attacker to
execute arbitrary commands upon shell invocation if he can control the
shell's environment. This is particularly dangerous if the shell is used
as a cgi interpreter for a web server, or if the shell handles untrusted
input inherited in the environment from other sources.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE Evergreen 11.4:
zypper in -t patch 2014-86
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

## Resolution

These issues affect all software that uses the Bash shell and parses values of environment variables. These issues are especially dangerous as there are many possible ways Bash can be called by an application. Quite often if an application executes another binary, Bash is invoked to accomplish this. Because of the pervasive use of the Bash shell, these issues are quite serious and should be treated as such.

In order to avoid exploitation from CVE-2014-6271, ensure that your system is updated to at least the following versions of Bash:

#### [RHSA-2014:1293](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1293.html)

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 - bash-4.2.45-5.el7\_0.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 - bash-4.1.2-15.el6\_5.1
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 - bash-3.2-33.el5.1

#### [RHSA-2014:1294](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1294.html)

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Lifecycle Support - bash-3.0-27.el4.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life - bash-3.2-24.el5\_6.1
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support - bash-3.2-32.el5\_9.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support - bash-4.1.2-9.el6\_2.1
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support - bash-4.1.2-15.el6\_4.1

#### [RHSA-2014:1295](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1295.html)

* SJIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 - bash-4.1.2-15.el6\_5.1.sjis.1
* SJIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 - bash-3.2-33.el5\_11.1.sjis.1

In order to avoid exploitation from CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, and CVE-2014-6278, ensure that your system is updated to at least the following versions of Bash, which also includes the prior fixes:

#### [RHSA-2014:1306](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html)

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 - bash-4.2.45-5.el7\_0.4
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 - bash-4.1.2-15.el6\_5.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 - bash-3.2-33.el5\_11.4

#### [RHSA-2014:1311](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html)

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Lifecycle Support - bash-3.0-27.el4.4
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life - bash-3.2-24.el5\_6.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support - bash-3.2-32.el5\_9.3
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support - bash-4.1.2-9.el6\_2.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support - bash-4.1.2-15.el6\_4.2

#### [RHSA-2014:1312](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html)

* SJIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 - bash-4.1.2-15.el6\_5.1.sjis.2
* SJIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 - bash-3.2-33.el5\_11.1.sjis.2

**NOTE:** Some additional information regarding customers who have RHEL 4 Standard or Premium Entitlements, but not ELS, is available at <https://access.redhat.com/discussions/1211573>

In order to update to the most recent version of the Bash package run the following command:

```
# yum update bash

```

Specify the package name in order to update to a particular version of Bash. For example, to update a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 system run:

```
# yum update bash-4.1.2-15.el6_5.2

```

## Root Cause

* A flaw was found in the bash functionality that evaluates specially formatted environment variables passed to it from another environment. This flaw is referred to as "Shellshock".

  An attacker could use this feature to override or bypass restrictions to the environment to execute shell commands before restrictions have been applied. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.
* For more information about this vulnerability, refer to the following article:

  [Bash Code Injection Vulnerability via Specially Crafted Environment Variables (CVE-2014-6271)](https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/1200223)

## Diagnostic Steps

* To determine if a system is affected by this vulnerability, review the version of Bash:

```
# rpm -qa bash

```

**주의** : 이 지식 기반의 영어 버전은 현재 자주 업데이트되고 있습니다. 최신 정보는 영어 버전을 참조하십시오.

Red Hat은 Red Hat 제품과 함께 제공되는 Bash 패키지의 모든 버전에 영향을 미치는 취약점에 대한 보고를 받았습니다. 이 취약점 [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) 을 사용하여 자의적인 코드를 실행할 수 있습니다. 인증되지 않은 원격 공격자가 특정 서비스 및 응용 프로그램 환경 변수를 제공할 수 있는 문제를 악용 할 수 있습니다.

**Update: 2014-09-30 18:00 UTC**

두개의 새로운 취약점이 사용 가능한 현재 Bash 패키지에 의해 완화되었다는 보고를 받았습니다. 자세한 정보는 [FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223#faq_six_CVE_assignments) 를 참조하시기 바랍니다.

**Update: 2014-09-29 05:00 UTC**

이 취약점을 악용하는 악성코드가 돌아다니고 있습니다. 이 취약점에 대한 자세한 내용은 [다음 기술자료](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1213683) 를 참조하십시오.

**Update: 2014-09-26 05:15 UTC**

Red Hat은 [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) 에 대한 패치가 미흡한 것으로 인식하고 있습니다. 공격자는 특정 상황에서 취약한 시스템에서 실행하는 자의적인 명령을 포함하는 특수하게 만들어진 환경 변수를 제공 할 수 있습니다. 이 새로운 문제는 [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) 에 대응하고 있습니다.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 및 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 Extended Life Cycle Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support, 그리고 Shift\_JIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 및 6의 서브스크립션을 가지고 계신 경우CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) 에 해당하는 bash 패키지의 업데이트 버전을 사용할 수 있습니다. 또한 [Red Hat Enterprise Linux 에서 특수하게 조작 된 환경 변수를 사용하여 Bash 코드 삽입 취약점 문제 해결 (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169)](https://access.redhat.com/node/1207723) 도 함께 참조하십시오.

## 진단 절차

Shellshock 취약점에 대한 패치가 시스템에 적용되었는지 여부를 확인하기 위해 [Red Hat Access Labs has provided a script](https://access.redhat.com/labs/shellshock/) 에서 스크립트가 제공되어 있습니다. 또한 다음 명령을 실행하면 사용하는 Bash 버전을 수동으로 테스트할 수 있습니다.

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"

```

사용하는 Bash 버전에 취약점이 포함 된 경우, 이 명령을 실행하면 vulnerable 문자 만 표시됩니다. 이 문제를 해결하는 패치를 사용하면 Bash 함수 종료 후에 어떠한 코드도 허용하지 않습니다. 이 명령을 실행했을 때 표시되는 경고 메시지의 내용은 사용하는 Bash 버전에 따라 다릅니다. 수정되지 않은 버전을 사용하는 경우는 다음과 같이 출력됩니다.

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
vulnerable
bash: BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
bash: BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0: `BASH_FUNC_x() () { :;}; echo vulnerable'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

원래 CVE-2014-6271 수정 만 적용하면 다음 출력이 생성됩니다.

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x()'
test

```

[RHSA-2014:1306](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html), [RHSA-2014:1311](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html) and [RHSA-2014:1312](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html) 에서 제공되는 추가 패치를 설치하면 다음과 같은 결과가 출력됩니다.

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

출력 내용은 아래의 "이 문제는 시스템에 어떤 영향을 가져올까요?" 절에 설명되어 있는 함수 처리가 변경 되었기 때문에 다릅니다. CVE-2014-7169 의 수정을 적용하면 파일 생성 문제로부터 시스템을 보호합니다. 다음 명령을 실행하면 사용자의 Bash가 CVE-2014-7169 영향을 받는지 여부를 테스트할 수 있습니다.

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
bash: x: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `='
bash: x: line 1: `'
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
Fri Sep 26 11:49:58 GMT 2014

```

만일 시스템이 취약한 상태라면, 시스템이 취약한 상태라고 화면에 시간이 표시되고 /tmp/echo 파일이 생성됩니다.

시스템에 취약점 문제가 포함되지 않는 경우는 다음과 같은 결과가 출력됩니다.

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
date
cat: /tmp/echo: No such file or directory

```

시스템이 취약한 상태의 경우 다음 명령을 실행하여 bash 패키지의 최신 버전을 업데이트하면 이 문제를 해결할 수 있습니다.

```
# yum update bash

```
## 이 문제는 시스템에 어떤 영향을 가져올까요?

이 문제는 Bash 쉘을 사용하여 환경 변수의 값을 해석하는 모든 제품에 적용됩니다. 응용 프로그램인 Bash 가 호출되는 경로는 많이 존재하기 때문에 이 문제는 특히 위험합니다. 응용 프로그램이 다른 바이너리를 실행할 경우, 실행을 위해 자주 Bash 가 호출됩니다. 이러한 Bash 쉘의 광범위한 사용 때문에, 이 문제는 매우 위험하며, 다음과 같이 대처해야만 합니다.

목록에 나열된 업데이트 버전 이전 버전은 모두 어느 정도 영향을 받습니다.

자세한 내용은 수정 내용을 기재한 각 문서를 참조하십시오.

CVE-2014-7169 패치를 적용하면 Bash 환경 변수를 평가하는 방법을 변경합니다. Bash 함수를 환경 변수로 직접 작성하는 응용 프로그램에 이러한 변경 사항을 인식해야합니다. 기존 함수는 같은 이름의 환경 변수에 저장해야 했습니다. 예를 들어, 함수 "compute"은 "compute" 라는 환경 변수에 저장됩니다. CVE-2014-7169 패치를 적용하면 이름은 "BASH\_FUNC\_compute ()" 입니다. 그 결과, "BASH\_FUNC\_compute()=() { }" 와 같이 환경 문자열에서 두 개의 괄호가 사용됩니다.

Bash 로 작성되는 함수는 "export -f" 명령으로 export 되는 경우에도 변경할 필요가 없습니다. Bash 는 내보낼 때 적절한 이름으로 투명하게 적용하고 함수 정의를 가져올 때 프로세스를 비활성화합니다.

이러한 환경 변수를 만들 서비스는 새로운 버전의 Bash 를 사용하도록 다시 시작해야합니다. 그러나 이 행위는 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 의 특정 버전에서 제공되는 패키지에서 사용되지는 않습니다. .

### 일반적인 설정 예:

Red Hat 은 이 문제의 심각도와 다양한 설정에 어떻게 영향을 주는지 이해를 돕기 위해 분석을 실시했습니다. 다음 표는 포괄적이지는 않지만, 특정 설정 하에서 이 문제의 영향의 예와 매우 복잡한 단계 때문에 이 문제에 영향을 주는 것을 확인하는 것이 불가능한 이유를 설명하고 있습니다 . 가장 권장되는 방법은 Bash 를 수정 된 버전으로 업그레이드 하는 것 입니다.

| 패키지 | 설명 |
| --- | --- |
| httpd | CGI 스크립트는 이 문제에 영향을 받을 가능성이 높습니다. CGI 스크립트를 web 서버에서 실행하면 이 스크립트는 환경 변수를 사용하여 스크립트에 데이터를 전달합니다. 공격자는이 환경 변수를 제어 할 수 있습니다. CGI 스크립트가 Bash 를 호출하면 이 스크립트는 자의적인 코드를 httpd 사용자로 실행할 수 있습니다. mod\_php, mod\_perl 및 mod\_python 환경 변수를 사용하지 않기 때문에 영향을 받지 않는 것으로 간주합니다. |
| Secure Shell (SSH) | rsync와 git 등의 SSH를 사용하여 사용자가 수행 할 수 있는 원격 명령을 제한하는 것은 드물지 않습니다. 이 때,이 취약점을 이용하여 제한된 명령뿐만 아니라 어떤 명령을 실행할 수 있습니다. |
| dhclient | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client (dhclient)를 사용하여 네트워크 설정 정보를 DHCP 에서 자동으로 가져옵니다. 이 클라이언트는 다양한 환경 변수를 사용하여 Bash를 실행하여 네트워크 인터페이스를 설정합니다. 공격자는 악성 DHCP 서버에 연결하여 클라이언트 시스템에서 자의적인 코드를 실행할 수 있습니다. |
| CUPS | CUPS 는이 문제의 영향을 받는다고 생각합니다. cups 필터를 실행할 때 사용자가 제공하는 다양한 값이 환경 변수에 저장됩니다. |
| sudo | sudo 에서 실행 한 명령은 이 문제의 영향을 받지 않습니다. 특히 sudo 는 함수에서 환경 변수를 찾습니다. 이렇게 하면 Bash 의 자식 프로세스가 자의적 코드를 실행할 수 있도록 실행중인 명령이 환경 변수를 설정하게 합니다. |
| Firefox | Firefox 에서는 Bash가 자의적인 명령을 실행할 수 있도록 환경 변수를 설정할 수 있다고 생각하지 않습니다. 그러나 이 작업을 허용하는 다양한 플러그인과 확장을 설치하는 것이 일반적이기 때문에 Bash를 업그레이드 할 것을 권장합니다. |
| Postfix | Postfix 서버는 다양한 문자를 ?로 대체합니다. Postfix 서버는 다양한 방법으로 Bash 를 호출하지만이 서버에 의해 자의적인 환경 변수를 설정할 수 있다고 생각하지 않습니다. 그러나 필터가 환경 변수를 설정할 가능성이 있습니다. |

## 자주 묻는 질문

이 FAQ는 Bash 취약점 CVE-2014-6271 대한 것입니다.

CVE-2014-6271 및 CVE-2014-7169에 대한 추가 정보는 <https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/09/26/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-shellshock-bash-flaws/> 를 참조 하십시오.

### 왜 CVE 가 6개나 있는 것일까요?

Bash의 최초 취약점은 [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) 에 할당되었습니다. 이 이슈가 공개되고난 직후, 발견자들이 비슷한 취약점이 처음 6개에 의해 차단되지 않는것을 발견하였고, 이것은 [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) 에 할당되었습니다. 이후, Red Hat 제품 보안 팀인 Florian Weimer 는 또다른 문제를 발견하고 [CVE-2014-7186](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186) 와 [CVE-2014-7187](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7187) 에 할당하였습니다.

최근, 2 개의 취약점이 더 보고되었고, 비록 이 취약점의 자세한 정보가 공개되지는 않았지만, [CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277) 와 [CVE-2014-6278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278) 에 할당되었습니다. 처음 4 개의 취약점이 최신 Bash 패키지에서 현재 수정되었으며, 마지막 두개의 취약점 또한 동일하게 완화되었습니다. 글을 쓰는 시점인 2014-0930 현재에는 Bash 패키지에 더 이상 알려진 보안 취약점이 없습니다. 실제 CVE 페이지를 참조하여 취약점의 최신 정보를 확인하시기 바랍니다.

소유하는 시스템이 본 취약점의 영향을 받을 수 있습니다. 어떻게 해야할까요?

### 소유하는 시스템이 본 취약점의 영향을 받을 수 있습니다. 어떻게 해야할까요?

패치 후에도 이 문서에 있는 진단을 수행하여 시스템이 취약한 상태라고 생각되거나 시스템이 취약하다고 판단되는 경우, [Red Hat 지원 케이스를 생성](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/new) 하거나 [지원팀에 전화](https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/technicalSupport) 로 연락 주시기 바랍니다.

### CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169 업데이트를 설치 한 후 시스템이나 서비스를 재시작 할 필요가 있습니까?

만일 시스템이 전달된 Bash 함수들을 사용하고 있다면, 영향받는 서비스들을 재시작하는 것이 권고됩니다. 영향받는 상호작용중인 유저들은 다시 로긴해할 지도 모르며, 스크린 혹은 tmux 세션 또한 재시작해야될 지도 모릅니다.

Bash 업데이트는 환경에서 전달된 함수의 이름을 변경하는 문제의 수정본을 제공하고 있습니다. 만일 함수가 오래된 버전의 Bash 에 의해 전달되었다면, 업데이트 이후에 새롭게 시작된 Bash 프로세스들에 의해 문제되지 않습니다. 또한 특별하게 정의되지 않게 됩니다. 서비스를 재시작하는 것은 새로운 버전의 Bash 가 예상된 이름으로 다시 보여지게끔 함수를 전달합니다.

어떤 서비스가 재시작되어야하는지 (어떤 유저가 다시 로긴되어야 하는지) 확인하기 위해서는 업데이트 이후에 다음 명령어를 수행합니다.

```
$ grep -l -z '[^)]=() {' /proc/[1-9]*/environ | cut -d/ -f3
```

출력된 PID 들은 환경에서 오래된 전달 함수 정의를 사용하고 있는 프로세스입니다. 이 프로세스들은 재시작되어야 합니다. 어떤 서비스가 재시작되어야 하는지 확인하려면 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 에서는 다음 명령어를 수행합니다.

```
$ systemctl status <PID>
```

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 혹은 이전 버전에서는 `pstree -p` 혹은 `ps -axuf` 를 통해 확인합니다.

### 다른 쉘은 이 문제의 영향을 받습니까?

Red Hat은이 문제에 대해 다른 쉘을 테스트 했습니다만, Bash 에서 보여진 동작을 재현 할 수 없었습니다. 향후 다른 쉘에서 비슷한 문제가 발견되면 필요에 따라 업데이트를 릴리스 할 것입니다.

### 이 문제를 완화하는 방법이 있을까요?

만일 업데이트 패키지 설치가 불가능한 경우에, 보다 자세한 가능한 완화법을 위해 [Mitigating the shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169)](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1212303) 문서를 참조하십시오. 가장 좋은 완화법은 (위에 언급한) 현재 모든 보고된 취약점에 보호받기위해 최신 가능한 패키지를 설치하는 것입니다.

RESOLUTION

HP has released the following software updates to resolve the vulnerability
in HP StoreFabric B-series switches running Bash Shell.

  Note: HP and the switch vendor recommend running an active version of
Fabric OS (FOS) listed on the HP Single Point of Connectivity Knowledge
(SPOCK) website ( <http://h20272.www2.hp.com/> ) and applying the work-around
information provided in the MITIGATION INFORMATION section below to protect
HP StoreFabric B-series switches from this vulnerability.

  Fabric OS (FOS) v7.3.0b (This version will be available soon and this
bulletin will revised at that time)

  The following focused fix FOS versions are available for the previously
released versions and have been renamed to include an additional hexadecimal
character appended to the FOS version on which it is based:

    FOS v7.2.1c1
    FOS v7.2.0d6
    FOS v7.1.2b1
    FOS v7.1.1c1
    FOS v7.1.0cb
    FOS v7.0.2e1
    FOS v7.0.0d1
    FOS v6.4.3f3
    FOS v6.4.2a3
    FOS v6.2.2f9

MITIGATION INFORMATION

  HP recommends the following steps to reduce the risk of this vulnerability:

    - Place the HP StoreFabric SAN switch and other data center critical
infrastructure behind a firewall to disallow access from the Internet.
    - Change all HP StoreFabric switch default account passwords, including
the root passwords, from the default factory passwords.
    - Examine the list of accounts, including ones on the switch and those
existing on remote authentication servers such as RADIUS, LDAP, and TACAS+,
to ensure only necessary personnel can gain access to HP StoreFabric FOS
switches. Delete guest accounts and temporary accounts created for one-time
usage needs.
    - Utilize FOS password policy management to strengthen the complexity,
age, and history requirements of switch account passwords.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-09-23 04:27:25 UTC  ``` Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris in team Prosecco, reported an issue in Network Security Services (NSS) libraries affecting all versions. He discovered that NSS is vulnerable to a variant of a signature forgery attack previously published by Daniel Bleichenbacher. This is due to lenient parsing of ASN.1 values involved in a signature and could lead to the forging of RSA certificates.  The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security also independently discovered and reported this issue.  Projects using NSS 3.17 should update the new 3.17.1 release.   External Reference:  <http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2014/mfsa2014-73.html>   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Intel Product Security Incident Response Team as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c4)  Huzaifa S.

This was in WooCommerce.  The WooCommerce PayPal logs indicated that SSL certificate validation was failing. This happened every time, over a period of 12 hours.  Theoretically this could indicate that someone was MITM-ing the connection, using this vulnerability. But that seems unlikely - there must be rather a lot of Digital Ocean servers in New York that want to connect to paypal.com. Is there any other possibility of how this update could have caused a problem?  In fact, the server had the same problem (certificate validation) connecting to stripe.com via HTTPS also, during that time.  When I rolled back the update, everything then worked again.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c9)  EJ Vincent    2014-09-28 01:09:23 UTC  ``` +1 David.  RHEL6 nss packages breaks Authorize.net / PayPal transactions. Apache service restart is required to clear the issue (or a roll back).  Users who are opted in to the automatic patching are getting a rude awakening on this one.

I am assuming WooCommerce is using nss and it fails to connect to paypal website after the nss upgrade?   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c13)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 10:54:37 UTC  ``` I wonder at which point NSS is involved in your configuration. Do you run mod_nss?  The connection that are breaking, do you connect to the main domains, or to a subdomain host (e.g. "some-subdomain.paypal.com")?  Did you get any entries in server logfiles that explain about the kind of failure, that might helpus?  In order to reproduce, I need to connect myself to one of the affected servers. (I wonder if it's the server certificates that are failing, or maybe something with the server-key-exchange of the servers you're trying to connect to.)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c14)  David Anderson    2014-09-29 11:22:13 UTC  ``` Hi,  WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin, and makes its http calls via the wp_remote_post() PHP function, which ultimately uses the PHP curl module.  When an order is made via PayPal checkout, the transaction happens on the PayPal site. PayPal then call back via ordinary HTTP to the website via a configured address. The website then makes an outgoing https call to PayPal, to verify the legitimacy of the callback and the status of the transaction. In WooCommerce, this is done via wp_remote_post(), with an <https://www.paypal.com> URL as the parameter.  WooCommerce was logging all the attempts to contact www.paypal.com via https from the time that the new nss was installed as failures due to an inability to validate www.paypal.com's SSL certificate.  PayPal allows these callback events to be replayed arbitrarily. I tried a few, and they all resulted in the same failure. I then checked my yum logs, downgraded the nss-* set of packages (the only thing to have changed), replayed the callbacks, and they all worked.  For the calls to stripe.com, this works more traditionally. The user types in their credit card number on my website (over an https connection to my website - and these were working fine, of course - I wouldn't have received any orders at all if it wasn't), and then the WooCommerce Stripe module makes POST requests to www.stripe.com to use its API. These also all failed - but there is no logging for these. I assume it was for the same reason. After downgrading nss-*, I contacted customers who had placed orders and tried to pay via Stripe, and those that came back and re-tried succeeded.  Nothing else was changed. Apache was not restarted.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c15)  David Anderson    2014-09-29 11:24:36 UTC  ``` "Did you get any entries in server logfiles that explain about the kind of failure, that might help us?"  The WooCommerce PayPal log stated that validation of the SSL certificate for PayPal was failing.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c16)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 12:03:49 UTC  ``` David, thank you for the details.  Based on your description, we might be able to reproduce the problem with a simple command like:   curl --head <https://www.paypal.com> while having the new NSS RPM packages installed, to see the failure.  I will see if I can reproduce the problem that way.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c17)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 12:29:13 UTC  ``` I cannot reproduce the error yet. I'm testing with a Centos 6.5 VM, fully updated.  # rpm -qa nss\* nspr\* curl\* libcurl\* | sort curl-7.19.7-37.el6_5.3.x86_64 libcurl-7.19.7-37.el6_5.3.x86_64 nspr-4.10.6-1.el6_5.x86_64 nss-3.16.1-7.el6_5.x86_64 nss_compat_ossl-0.9.6-1.el6.x86_64 nss-softokn-3.14.3-12.el6_5.x86_64 nss-softokn-freebl-3.14.3-12.el6_5.x86_64 nss-sysinit-3.16.1-7.el6_5.x86_64 nss-tools-3.16.1-7.el6_5.x86_64 nss-util-3.16.1-2.el6_5.x86_64  Maybe you are seeing a different set of server certificates from your position in the network?  I assume you aren't using authentication based on a client certificate, but are using simple unauthenticated https?  Could you please run this command on your server, and attach the log.txt to this bug? You can run it from your live system. It will simply execute a test connection to paypal, dump some connection results, and will disconnect immediately. It's fine to run it using the older NSS packages. It will tell us the certificates that your server sees when it makes a direct connection to the paypal server.  openssl s_client -showcerts -connect www.paypal.com:443 \    < /dev/null > /tmp/log.txt 2>&1   In addition, if you have a secondary test system (non-production) where you could temporarily install the latest NSS packages again, I would be interested in the output of   curl --head <https://www.paypal.com> (you should get a failure, if curl+nss is the culprit)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c18)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 12:57:31 UTC  ``` I installed php, and ran an interactive test.  I have a test.php file that contains:  <?php $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "<https://www.paypal.com/>"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 1); curl_exec($ch); curl_close($ch); ?>  I ran it using:   php -f test.php  I received a valid http response from the paypal server.  Either you are getting different certificates from the server (which I hope you will be able to provide), or there must be a non-obvious detail inside your interaction with the server that causes the issue.  The curl and php software used in a simple way seem to work correctly.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c19)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 13:55:57 UTC  ``` David, on Twitter, I found this statement from Stripe: <https://twitter.com/search?q=nss%20centos&src=typd>  "We've seen reports that a recent CentOS update for NSS is affecting SSL-enabled PHP libraries for processes started before the update. While the Stripe API is unaffected, PHP sites on CentOS may see errors with libraries like stripe-php. Restarting Apache fixes the issue."  Based on this message:  You might experience the issue, because you haven't stopped your processes. You should restart them.  This update consists of multiple libraries which depend on each other.  For example, if the application you're running continues to have one of the old libraries loaded, but during operation, your application dynamically loads one of the newer libraries from disk, you will have an incompatibility between the libraries, which can cause the application to malfunction.  You should stop your applications prior to the upgrade, and restart them after the upgrade is done.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c20)  Kai Engert (:kaie) (inactive account)    2014-09-29 13:56:28 UTC  ``` Correct link to the Twitter message: <https://twitter.com/stripestatus/status/516026559669358592>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2014-09-29 14:08:36 UTC  ``` Some additional flaw details in Adam Langley's blog post:  <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/09/26/pkcs1.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c22)  David Anderson    2014-09-29 14:26:10 UTC  ``` Hi Kai,  It's true that I didn't restart Apache after applying the update - but that's because the update was via yum automatic updates. It was not a manually applied update.  Shouldn't scripts in the update automatically restart any relevant services that are likely to not function correctly without a restart, rather than waiting for manual intervention?  If I re-apply the update, I'd be likely to restart Apache immediately - the machine is processing live orders, and I'd rather just remain in ignorance as to the cause of the defect, rather than have downtime on a live store.

We're left with a conundrum: an update was pushed to servers, which broke applications relying on third-party payment processors, yet Red Hat does not make it a habit to restart services, such as Apache, following an update. To be fair, that's expected.  As a result, applications remained in a broken state with very little visibility. The damage was already done, at which point customers start to take notice and wonder what's up.  Generally speaking, customers who use automatic updates don't make it a habit to review CVE changelogs or Red Hat errata (not feigning ignorance). I'd hate to recommend adding nss packages to the yum exclusion list.  Am I making any sense?  Thanks for all that you do!   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=1145429#c29)  Ronald    2014-10-03 04:44:12 UTC  ``` We experienced the same situation with RHEL6 after applying the nss update with PayPal, with Virtual Merchant (now Converge, by Elavon) and with First Data.  All of these were using php/curl.  Another gateway (CyberSource) using their proprietary SOAP client was not affected. Some notes which differ from the experiences described above:  - nss install was manual after prompted by Webmin and Apache was not restarted - all transactions continued to process normally (over 12 hours) until Apache was restarted by automatic log rotation process with Apache restart.  Transactions for all three gateways failed until system reboot was performed. (Another Apache restart was not attempted, since that was the trigger for the failure.)  - regarding the sub-domain question, of our gateways, Virtual Merchant uses a www. sub-domain, First Data and PayPal use sub-domains other than www.  - other nss updates had been applied in the same manner without impact to these gateways (recently 2014-07-25, 2014-02-14, 2013-12-23, 2013-12-13)  Thought I would share our experience.

openSUSE Security Update: bash: security and bugfix update
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1226-1
Rating: critical
References: #868822 #895475 #896776
Cross-References: CVE-2014-2524 CVE-2014-6271
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.1
openSUSE 12.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
bash was updated to fix a critical security issue, a minor security issue
and bugs:
In some circumstances, the shell would evaluate shellcode in environment
variables passed at startup time. This allowed code execution by local or
remote attackers who could pass environment variables to bash scripts.
(CVE-2014-6271)
Fixed a temporary file misuse in \_rl\_tropen (bnc#868822) Even if used only
by developers to debug readline library do not
open temporary files from public location without O\_EXCL (CVE-2014-2524)
Additional bugfixes:
- Backported corrected german error message for a failing getpwd
(bnc#895475)
- Add bash upstream patch 47 to fix a problem where the function that
shortens pathnames for $PS1 according to the value of $PROMPT\_DIRTRIM
uses memcpy on potentially-overlapping regions
of memory, when it should use memmove. The result is garbled pathnames
in prompt strings.
- Add bash upstream patch 46 to fix a problem introduced by patch 32 a
problem with "$@" and arrays expanding empty positional parameters or
array elements when using substring expansion, pattern substitution, or
case modfication. The empty parameters
or array elements are removed instead of expanding to empty strings ("").
- Add bash-4.2-strcpy.patch from upstream mailing list to patch collection
tar ball to avoid when using \w in the prompt and changing the directory
outside of HOME the a strcpy work on
overlapping memory areas.

## Warning

These mitigations involve making changes that could lead to unintended consequences if they are not performed correctly. It is recommended that only experienced system administrators who fully understand the implications of these changes apply the mitigations documented in this article. These mitigations have only been subjected to limited testing by Red Hat.

**Important:** Given that package updates are available to correct the flaws these mitigations were provided for, these mitigations should only be used in exceptional circumstances and not as a replacement for installing the updated packages. Red Hat recommends all users of Bash to upgrade to the updated packages as swiftly as possible.

## Network-based mitigations

### Network mitigation 1: mod\_security rules

The following mod\_security rules can be used to reject HTTP requests containing data that may be interpreted by Bash as a function definition if set in its environment. They can be used to block attacks against web services, such as attacks against CGI applications.

Request Header values:

```
SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS "^\(\s*\)\s+{" "phase:1,deny,id:1000000,t:urlDecode,status:400,log,msg:'CVE-2014-6271 - Bash Attack'"

```

SERVER\_PROTOCOL values:

```
SecRule REQUEST_LINE "^\(\s*\)\s+{" "phase:1,deny,id:1000001,status:400,log,msg:'CVE-2014-6271 - Bash Attack'"

```

GET/POST names:

```
SecRule ARGS_NAMES "^\(\s*\)\s+{" "phase:2,deny,id:1000002,t:urlDecode,t:urlDecodeUni,status:400,log,msg:'CVE-2014-6271 - Bash Attack'"

```

GET/POST values:

```
SecRule ARGS "^\(\s*\)\s+{" "phase:2,deny,id:1000003,t:urlDecode,t:urlDecodeUni,status:400,log,msg:'CVE-2014-6271 - Bash Attack'"

```

File names for uploads:

```
SecRule FILES_NAMES "^\(\s*\)\s+{"  "phase:2,deny,id:1000004,t:urlDecode,t:urlDecodeUni,status:400,log,msg:'CVE-2014-6271  - Bash Attack'"

```

It is possible, however unlikely, that these rules may result in false positives. These false positives, along with actual attempts, could result in log files of significant size.

### Network mitigation 2: IPTables rules

It is possible to use IPTables string matching to attempt to drop packets that could be part of an attack, using:

```
# iptables -A INPUT -m string --algo bm --hex-string '|28 29 20 7B|' -j DROP
# ip6tables -A INPUT -m string --algo bm --hex-string '|28 29 20 7B|' -j DROP

```

Note that this is a weak workaround, as an attacker could easily send one or two characters per packet, which would avoid matching this signature check. It may, in conjunction with logging, provide an overview of automated attempts at exploiting this vulnerability.

## System-based mitigations

The shellshock vulnerability arises from the fact that you can create environment variables with specially-crafted values before calling the Bash shell. These variables can contain code, which gets executed as soon as the shell is invoked. The initial patch for CVE-2014-6271 was found to be incomplete. The patch for CVE-2014-7169 addresses this, but it does not entirely remove the vulnerable functionality. If you entirely remove the vulnerable functionality from Bash, all possible attack variants will be mitigated.

### System-based mitigation 1: LD\_PRELOAD

LD\_PRELOAD is an environment variable used by the runtime linking process by searching for shared libraries at alternate locations and by forcibly loading and linking libraries that would be used. This forces some symbols/functions to be loaded and prioritized over built in functions a program. This code creates a new function "strip\_env" with the gcc "constructor" attribute set. Functions with this attribute set will execute before entering main(). See [https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Function-Attributes.html](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgcc.gnu.org%2Fonlinedocs%2Fgcc%2FFunction-Attributes.html) for more details.

* Download: [bash\_ld\_preload.c](https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/attachments/bash_ld_preload.c)
* Verify the SHA-256 checksum:

```
$ sha256sum bash_ld_preload.c
28cb0ab767a95dc2f50a515106f6a9be0f4167f9e5dbc47db9b7788798eef153
bash_ld_preload.c

```

* Compile it:

```
$ gcc bash_ld_preload.c -fPIC -shared -Wl,-soname,bash_ld_preload.so.1 \
-o bash_ld_preload.so

```

* Copy bash\_ld\_preload.so to /lib:

```
# cp bash_ld_preload.so /lib/

```

If you wish to apply this workaround across the entire system:

* Add the following to /etc/ld.so.preload on a line by itself:

```
/lib/bash_ld_preload.so

```

* Restart all relevant services or reboot the system.

Note that this is potentially very dangerous. It is recommend that you just apply this workaround to specific services that may be exploitable on your system. This can be achieved by adding bash\_ld\_preload.so to the LD\_PRELOAD environment variable in the script that will initialize the service. However, this will not work for services that use SUID binaries in some capacity (e.g. httpd with SUEXEC), as SUID binaries will not honour the LD\_PRELOAD command.

* Add the following two lines at the top of /etc/init.d/httpd, after the shebang line:

```
LD_PRELOAD=/lib/bash_ld_preload.so
export LD_PRELOAD

```

* Edit httpd.conf and add the following directive and save the configuration file:

```
PassEnv LD_PRELOAD

```

* Then restart httpd:

```
# service httpd restart

```
### System-based mitigation 2: systemtap

It may be possible to mitigate by enforcing bash to use privileged mode.

install the bash debuginfo

```
$ sudo debuginfo-install bash

```

install systemtap

```
$ sudo yum install systemtap

```

Run this command:

```
$ nohup sudo stap -g -e '  probe process("/bin/bash").function("initialize_shell_variables") { $privmode=1 }  '

```

This ensures that the bash privileged mode (the equivalent of bash -p) is always enabled. To verify, test for the original vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271):

```
$ env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
this is a test

```

The above is an example when it is NOT affected. Finally, test for the new vulnerability (CVE-2014-7169):

```
$  env X='() { (a)=>\' sh -c "echo date"; cat echo
date
cat: echo: No such file or directory

```

The above is an example when it is NOT affected.

Force-enabling privileged mode has side effects that some system administrators may need to be aware of. Listed below is a relevant extract from the bash man page.

```
  -p  Turn on privileged mode.  In this mode, the $ENV and $BASH_ENV files
      are not processed, shell functions are not inherited from the
      environment, and the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE
      variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored.  If the
      shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the
      real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, these
      actions are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user
      id.  If the -p option is supplied at startup, the effective user id
      is not reset.  Turning this option off causes the effective user and
      group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.

```

This script above is a temporary mitigation and will not persist between reboots.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c0)  Wade Mealing    2014-09-15 02:24:57 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the bash functionality that evaluates specially formatted environment variables passed to it from another environment.  An attacker could use this feature to override or bypass restrictions to the environment to execute shell commands before restrictions have been applied.  Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.

The import of functions from the environment is a GNU bash-only feature. Neither zsh nor mksh support this.  The format GNU bash uses is that, if an imported variable begins with “() {”, it’s taken as function. For every other shell, these are just normal strings.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c33)  Björn Puttmann    2014-09-25 12:16:23 UTC  ``` You are absolutely correct.

Yes, that is one of the CVEs that Red Hat builds are already immune to, by virtue of moving the function exports out of the regular variable namespace.  >  > See >  > <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.de/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html>  That blog is recommending that other distros and upstream bash follow Red Hat's lead.  >  > It seems to be recommended at this stage to kill the feature from orbit. >  > See <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13>  That is the patch Red Hat used to avoid ALL parser bugs becoming Shell Shock exploit avenues.  You do NOT need to kill function exporting, only kill the confusion of a regular variable being mistaken for a function export, which Red Hat has done.   ```  [Comment 55](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c55)  Peter Backes    2014-09-27 22:48:51 UTC  ``` Thanks Eric for clarification   ```  [Comment 56](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c56)  Mark Casey    2014-09-29 04:16:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Eric Blake from [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c47)) > (In reply to Fabio S.

Eric,  I'm testing upstream bash 4.3.27, built from source, and your method from [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c47) still includes 'vulnerable' in the output. However, none of the individual tests I can find for the CVEs I'm aware of seem to fail on their own - so I am a bit confused.  As far as I can tell I am passing everything from [ <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223> ], and also clear of the tests in your message at [ <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2014-09/msg00238.html> ]  Here is the console output of running the test from [comment #47](show_bug.cgi?id=1141597#c47):  > testuser@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ bash --version > GNU bash, version 4.3.27(1)-release (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu) > Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc. > License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <<http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>> >  > This is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it. > There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law. > testuser@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:~$ cd /tmp && rm -f /tmp/echo && \ > >      env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'f=() { (a)=>\' \ > >      bash -c 'echo echo vulnerable'; cat echo > echo vulnerable > cat: echo: No such file or directory > testuser@ip-xxx-xx-xx-xxx:/tmp$  I'm wondering if I'm simply failing to make a distinction between a line that says 'echo vulnerable' and a line that literally just says 'vulnerable'.(?)

* CVE-2014-6271

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-09-24 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.

See more information about CVE-2014-6271 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-6271)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : bash
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-6271

Stephane Chazelas discovered a vulnerability in bash, the GNU
Bourne-Again Shell, related to how environment variables are
processed.  In many common configurations, this vulnerability is
exploitable over the network, especially if bash has been configured
as the system shell.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2+dfsg-0.1+deb7u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your bash packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Bash is available in Red Hat Linux virtual machine images that can be deployed by using IBM Workload Deployer. Six Bash vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014. This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock” and two memory corruption vulnerabilities. Bash is used by IBM Workload Deployer.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID**: [CVE-2014-6271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

## Affected Products and Versions

All versions of IBM Workload Deployer 3.1 and later fix packs

## Remediation/Fixes

The solution is to apply the fixes with the following direction:

Upgrade the deployed virtual machines by using one of the following two methods:

**Option 1:** Update the virtual machine by using an eFix provided by IBM:

* Download the eFix from IBM Fix Central (see the following link):

<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Workload+Deployer&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=HV_RHEL6_X64_PATCHES_EFIX&includeSupersedes=0>
* Import the eFix into the IBM Workload Deployer Emergency Fix catalog.

* For deployed instances, apply this Emergency Fix on the virtual machine. Bash is upgraded to version bash-4.1.2-15.e16\_5.2.

**Option 2:** Upgrade the virtual machine with fixes obtained from Red Hat

* Contact Red Hat to obtain fixes and install these fixes directly on the deployed virtual machines as needed.

For images, you must extend and capture the image by using the following general procedure:

1. Import the eFix into the IBM Workload Deployer Emergency Fix catalog.
2. From the image catalog, select the image and click "Extend."
3. After the image extend operation completes succcessfully, click Service from the deployed virtual machine.
4. Apply this emergency fix.
5. From the image catalog, capture the image.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Quick notes about the bash bug, its impact, and the fixes so far](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html)

We spent a good chunk of the day investigating the [now-famous bash bug](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/24/11) (CVE-2014-6271), so I had no time to make too many jokes about it on Twitter - but I wanted to jot down several things that have been getting drowned out in the noise earlier in the day.Let's start with the nature of the bug. At its core, the problem caused by an obscure and little-known feature that allows bash programs to export function definitions from a parent shell to children shells, similarly to how you can export normal environmental variables. The functionality in action looks like this:
$ function foo { echo "hi mom"; }
$ export -f foo
$ bash -c 'foo' # Spawn nested shell, call 'foo'
hi mom

The behavior is implemented as a hack involving specially-formatted environmental variables: in essence, any variable starting with a literal "() {" will be dispatched to the parser just before executing the main program. You can see this in action here:
$ foo='() { echo "hi mom"; }' bash -c 'foo'
hi mom

The concept of granting magical properties to certain values of environmental variables clashes with several ancient customs - most notably, with the tendency for web servers such as Apache to pass client-supplied strings in the environment to any subordinate binaries or scripts. Say, if I request a CGI or PHP script from your server, the env variables `$HTTP_COOKIE` and `$HTTP_USER_AGENT` will be probably initialized to the raw values seen in the original request. If the values happen to begin with "() {" and are ever seen by `/bin/bash`, events may end up taking an unusual turn.And so, the bug we're dealing with stems from the observation that trying to parse function-like strings received in `HTTP_*` variables could have some unintended side effects in that shell - namely, it could easily lead to your server executing arbitrary commands trivially supplied in a HTTP header by random people on the Internet.With that out of the way, it is important to note that the [today's patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-025) provided by the maintainer of bash **does not** stop the shell from trying to parse the code within headers that begin with "() {" - it merely tries to get rid of that particular RCE side effect, originally triggered by appending commands past the end of the actual function def. But even with all the current patches applied, you can still do this:
Cookie: () { echo "Hello world"; }

...and witness a callable function dubbed `HTTP_COOKIE()` materialize in the context of subshells spawned by Apache; of course, the name will be always prefixed with `HTTP_*`, so it's unlikely to clash with anything or be called by incident - but intuitively, it's a pretty scary outcome.In the same vein, doing this will also have an unexpected result:
Cookie: () { oops

If specified on a request to a bash-based CGI script, you will see a scary bash syntax error message in your error log.All in all, the fix hinges on two risky assumptions:

1. That the bash function parser invoked to deal with variable-originating function definitions is robust and does not suffer from the usual range of low-level C string parsing bugs that almost always haunt similar code - a topic that, when it comes to shells, hasn't been studied in much detail before now. (In fact, I am aware of a ~~privately made~~ [now disclosed](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/32) report of such errors in the parser - CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187.)*Update (Sep 26): I also bumped into what seems to be a separate and probably exploitable use of an uninitialized pointer in the parser code; shared the details privately upstream.*- That the parsing steps are guaranteed to have no global side effects within the child shell. As it happens, this assertion has been already [proved wrong](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/514887394294652929) by Tavis (CVE-2014-7169); the side effect he found [probably-maybe isn't devastating](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/24/40) in the general use case (at least until the next stroke of brilliance), but it's certainly a good reason for concern.*Update (Sep 26): Found a sixth and most severe issue that is essentially equivalent to the original RCE on all systems that only have the original, maintainer-provided patch.*

Contrary to multiple high-profile reports, the original fix was not "broken" in the sense that there is no universal RCE exploit for it - but if I were a betting man, I would not bet on the patch holding up in the long haul *(Update: as noted above, it did not hold up)*. A more reasonable solution would involve temporarily disabling function imports, putting them behind a runtime flag, or blacklisting some of the most dangerous variable patterns (e.g., `HTTP_*`); and later on, perhaps moving to a model where function exports use a [distinct namespace](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) while present in the environment.What else? Oh, of course: the impact of this bug is an interesting story all in itself. At first sight, the potential for remote exploitation should be limited to CGI scripts that start with `#!/bin/bash` and to several other programs that explicitly request this particular shell. But there's a catch: on a good majority of modern Linux systems, `/bin/sh` is actually a symlink to `/bin/bash`!This means that web apps written in languages such as PHP, Python, C++, or Java, are [likely to be vulnerable](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/24/17) if they ever use libcalls such as `popen()` or `system()`, all of which are backed by calls to `/bin/sh -c '...'`. There is also some added web-level exposure through `#!/bin/sh` CGI scripts, `<!--#exec cmd="...">` calls in SSI, and possibly more exotic vectors such as `mod_ext_filter`.For the same reason, userland DHCP clients that invoke configuration scripts and use variables to pass down config details are at risk when exposed to rogue servers (e.g., on open wifi). A handful of MTAs, MUAs, or FTP server architectures may be also of concern - in particular, there are third-party reports of [qmail installations being at risk](http://marc.info/?l=qmail&m=141183309314366&w=2). Finally, there is some exposure for environments that use restricted SSH shells (possibly including Git) or restricted sudo commands, but the security of such approaches is typically fairly modest to begin with.Exposure on other fronts is possible, but probably won't be as severe. The worries around PHP and other web scripting languages, along with the concern for userspace DHCP, are the most significant reasons to upgrade - and perhaps to roll out more paranoid patches, rather than relying solely on the two official ones. On the upside, you don't have to worry about non-bash shells - and that covers a good chunk of embedded systems out there. In particular, contrary to several claims, Busybox should be fine.*Update (Sep 28): the previously-unofficial namespace isolation patch from Florian has eventually made it [upstream](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027). You should deploy that patch [ASAP](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html).**PS. As for the inevitable "why hasn't this been noticed for 15 years" / "I bet the NSA knew about it" stuff - my take is that it's a very unusual bug in a very obscure feature of a program that researchers don't really look at, precisely because no reasonable person would expect it to fail this way. So, life goes on.*

   This is actually a feature of GNU bash. One I could never understand, but, oh well.

   You can tighten your GNU/Linux-based systems to prevent this from leaking into popen/system.
   (No need to do this on Android/Linux because they use mksh as /system/bin/sh by default.)
   Install mksh, and use it as /bin/sh (on Debian-based systems, make the symlink to /bin/lksh
   which contains some quirks (enabled by being called as sh) which some legacy Debian
   maintainer scripts need).

     The later versions of debian have sh symlinked to dash, which does not suffer from this particular vulnerability.

   Given enough eyeballs all bugs are shallow. Thanks for the write-up, it surely explains many doubts about this vulnerability.

   I would assume the sensible defense here involves a patch to mod\_cgi to ignore (or possibly, prefix with an extra space) any headers whose values begin with the four characters '() {'.

   That and an update to any web application firewalls to wipe out any headers beginning with that sequence. Also, a snort rule to search out HTTP headers beginning with '() {' seems to be in order.

   I wonder why openBSD always said bash should not be used, and could be as any bloatware a security issue.
   I guess you are right no one could know, and that is the problem with bloatwares, no one cannot know if it is working «normally».
   But maybe stopping to use and make bloawares (like most of the tools we are designing nowadays) would expose us to less threats?
   Maybe Oauth2 is indeed the next harbringer of a new catastroph or diameter, or .... django or .... apache, mysql, emacs or vim...or dbus, systemd, gnome ...
   Maybe it is time to go back to basics: simpler tools that do one task and do it well. And taking time to code correctly

   Could bash disable this "feature" when invoked as /bin/sh, but enable it when invoked as /bin/bash?

   The vast majority of PHP pages are executed with mod\_php, not CGI, and thus are not vulnerable to this bug (as they never launch a bash process in the first place).

     As noted in the post, the main concern here would be any call to functions that are backed by popen() / system(), which are somewhat prevalent in especially in apps written in Python, PHP, and other interpreted languages.

     The other prerequisite is that at the time of the call, the environment must contain attacker-controlled variable values; this is probably not a concern for in-process execution on Apache via mod\_php, but may very well be for suphp, mod\_fcgid, and so on; and for most non-PHP languages such as Python.

   You wrote: "This means that web apps written in languages such as PHP, Python, C++, or Java, are likely to be vulnerable if they ever use libcalls such as popen() or system()"

   For the life of me, I just cannot get to work… On my (still) unpatched test servers, I've got that PHP script "installed": https://gist.github.com/alexs77/1357baf1b084a365becb

   It does a system("/usr/bin/id") and a shell\_exec("/bin/hostname") — but no testsite (eg. http://shellshock.brandonpotter.com/ and http://bashsmash.ccsir.org/) show this script as being exploitable.

   Could somebody maybe show the source of a PHP script, which can be exploited? I would like to "install" that on my servers and test again.

     Check the environment first. IIRC, some in-process ways of invoking PHP do not involve putting HTTP headers in env variables, in which case, you should be fine. I think that's the case for mod\_php, but not for mod\_fcgid, suphp, etc.

     Have same issue while testing php script with system('ls -l') on Ubuntu VM with Apache + php-cgi.
     Solution for me - change symlink /bin/sh from /bin/dash to /bin/bash. After that I got working bash bug on this script.

      6278. Although, both '78 and '77 are bad (as in, remotely exploitable).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

## Update 2014-09-30 19:30 UTC

Questions have arisen around whether Red Hat products are vulnerable to [CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277) and [CVE-2014-6278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278).  We have determined that [RHSA-2014:1306](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html), [RHSA-2014:1311,](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html) and [RHSA-2014:1312](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html) successfully mitigate the vulnerability and no additional actions need to be taken.

## Update 2014-09-26 12:00 UTC

We have written a FAQ to address some of the more common questions seen regarding the recent bash issues.

[Frequently Asked Questions about the Shellshock Bash flaws](https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/09/26/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-shellshock-bash-flaws/ "Frequently Asked Questions about the Shellshock Bash flaws")

---

## Update 2014-09-26 02:20 UTC

Red Hat has released patched versions of Bash that fix CVE-2014-7169.  Information regarding these updates can be found in the [errata](https://web.archive.org/web/20140926032635/https%3A//rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html).  All customers are strongly encouraged to apply the update as this flaw is being actively attacked in the wild.

Fedora has also released a patched version of Bash that fixes CVE-2014-7169.  Additional information can be found on [Fedora Magazine](http://fedoramagazine.org/shellshock-update-bash-packages-that-resolve-cve-2014-6271-and-cve-2014-7169-available/).

---

## Update 2014-09-25 16:00 UTC

Red Hat is aware that the patch for CVE-2014-6271 is incomplete. An attacker can provide specially-crafted environment variables containing arbitrary commands that will be executed on vulnerable systems under certain conditions. The new issue has been  assigned CVE-2014-7169.

We are working on patches in conjunction with the upstream developers as a critical priority. For details on a workaround, please see the [knowledgebase article](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223).

Red Hat advises customers to upgrade to the version of Bash which contains the fix for CVE-2014-6271 and not wait for the patch which fixes CVE-2014-7169. CVE-2014-7169 is a less severe issue and patches for it are being worked on.

Bash or the Bourne again shell, is a UNIX like shell, which is perhaps one of the most installed utilities on any Linux system. From its creation in 1980, Bash has evolved from a simple terminal based command interpreter to many other fancy uses.

In Linux, environment variables provide a way to influence the behavior of software on the system. They typically consists of a name which has a value assigned to it. The same is true of the Bash shell. It is common for a lot of programs to run Bash shell in the background. It is often used to provide a shell to a remote user (via ssh, telnet, for example), provide a parser for CGI scripts (Apache, etc) or even provide limited command execution support (git, etc)

Coming back to the topic, the vulnerability arises from the fact that you can create environment variables with specially-crafted values before calling the Bash shell. These variables can contain code, which gets executed as soon as the shell is invoked. The name of these crafted variables does not matter, only their contents. As a result, this vulnerability is exposed in many contexts, for example:

* ForceCommand is used in sshd configs to provide limited command execution capabilities for remote users. This flaw can be used to bypass that and provide arbitrary command execution. Some Git and Subversion deployments use such restricted shells. Regular use of OpenSSH is not affected because users already have shell access.
* Apache server using mod\_cgi or mod\_cgid are affected if CGI scripts are either written in Bash, or spawn subshells. Such subshells are implicitly used by system/popen in C, by os.system/os.popen in Python, system/exec in PHP (when run in CGI mode), and open/system in Perl if a shell is used (which depends on the command string).
* PHP scripts executed with mod\_php are not affected even if they spawn subshells.
* DHCP clients invoke shell scripts to configure the system, with values taken from a potentially malicious server. This would allow arbitrary commands to be run, typically as root, on the DHCP client machine.
* Various daemons and SUID/privileged programs may execute shell scripts with environment variable values set / influenced by the user, which would allow for arbitrary commands to be run.
* Any other application which is hooked onto a shell or runs a shell script as using Bash as the interpreter. Shell scripts which do not export variables are not vulnerable to this issue, even if they process untrusted content and store it in (unexported) shell variables and open subshells.

Like "real" programming languages, Bash has functions, though in a somewhat limited implementation, and it is possible to put these Bash functions into environment variables. This flaw is triggered when extra code is added to the end of these function definitions (inside the enivronment variable). Something like:

```
$ env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
 vulnerable
 this is a test
```

The patch used to fix this flaw, ensures that no code is allowed after the end of a Bash function. So if you run the above example with the patched version of Bash, you should get an output similar to:

```
 $ env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"
 bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
 bash: error importing function definition for `x'
 this is a test
```

We believe this should not affect any backward compatibility. This would, of course, affect any scripts which try to use environment variables created in the way as described above, but doing so should be considered a bad programming practice.

Red Hat has issued security advisories that fixes this issue for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Fedora has also shipped packages that fixes this issue.

We have additional information regarding specific Red Hat products affected by this issue that can be found at [https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/1207723](https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/1207723 "https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/1207723")

## ShellShock

# ShellShock 101 - What you need to know and do, to ensure your systems are secure

#### What is the ShellShock vulnerability and how do I know it exists on my systems?

A new vulnerability has been found that potentially affects Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X operating systems. First disclosed on September 24, 2014 and commonly known as the “Bash Bug” or “ShellShock”, the GNU Bash Remote Code Execution Vulnerability ([CVE-2014-6271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271) and [CVE-2014-7169](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169)) could allow attackers to gain control over a targeted computer if exploited successfully, giving them access to your data and networks.

The vulnerability leverages the Bash shell, a command language interpreter. An attacker can attach malicious code to environment variables that affect the way processes are run on a computer.

If you are using versions of Bash in operating systems based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 9, 10 or 11, your servers are potentially at risk. If your systems are affected, we recommend that you patch your systems right away.

[SUSE Manager](/products/suse-manager/) can also be used to verify the status of your systems, and apply the ShellShock patches if necessary. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvGe0VyNiM&list=UUbkuT_ABdCbrTIrQqzVeXcg) to see how quick and easy it is to verify, patch and audit your systems with SUSE Manager.

#### Is a patch available for me if I have current subscriptions and am running the most current version of SUSE Linux Enterprise 9, 10 or 11? What if I'm running earlier versions and have subscribed to Long Term Service Pack Support?

Yes and yes. There are two patches that close this vulnerability that you can access and apply, if you are a current customer with active support subscriptions, or a current customer with active support subscriptions and Long Term Service Pack Support (LTSS).

These patches are available through SUSE maintenance channels for your particular operating system. Instructions for how to get access to these patches and update your systems is available through [SUSE Update Advisories](/support/update/). Additional information about the process is available through this [SUSE Knowledgebase entry](/support/kb/doc?id=7015702).

#### What if I'm a current customer but I'm using older operating systems for some of my servers without a support contract like Long Term Service Pack Support for those older versions? Can I still get the patches?

Yes. Our primary concern and first priority is to make sure that your systems are secure.

Given the widespread use of Bash and its inclusion in multiple generations of our operating system products, we consider this to be an extraordinary circumstance. We want to make sure that all of your systems are protected, even those that you may have inadvertently chosen to run in an unsupported fashion.

In order to get access to these patches, we've created a special entitlement for you. Please go to our [patch finder](https://scc.suse.com/patches/) site to access and download the patches that you need. Alternatively, you can notify your local contact at our [global technical support organization](/support/). Once they have confirmed that you are a current customer with active support subscriptions, they will help you open a service request and provide you with instructions on how to access the security patches for your earlier, unsupported operating systems.

#### What if I'm using SUSE Linux Enterprise-based operating systems offered by public cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services? Do I need to patch those systems?

If you initiated service on or after Saturday, September 27, at 2 PM EDT, then your systems have already been patched and are secure. If your services were started prior to that date, your systems are potentially at risk. In order to ensure that your systems are secure, we recommend that you restart your services on secure systems, or patch your existing systems following the instructions described in the [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, AWS Updates & ShellShock blog](/c/blog/suse-linux-enterprise-server-aws-updates-shellshock/).

#### What does the patch address or not address? Do I need to do anything else after applying the patch to make sure I'm no longer vulnerable?

Applying the two patches eliminates the ability to append the Bash environmental variables with malicious code. After applying the patches, there are no additional tasks required to ensure you are no longer vulnerable.

SUSE works around the clock to fix known security issues that impact its supported products. When we become aware of an issue and a patch is created, we provide this information to our customers through security updates. As a general rule, we recommend that you watch for these updates and apply any patches that are critical to keeping your systems secure.

Customers can choose to be notified daily or weekly, via email or RSS, about just security updates, or all of the updates that are available for their systems. Go to our [patch finder](https://scc.suse.com/patches/) page for more information about how you can subscribe to proactive notifications.

#### After first hearing about this ShellShock vulnerability, I've since heard about other related security issues. Are there additional issues, and does it affect my systems?

There have been additional disclosures about related security vulnerabilities involving the Bash shell, but your SUSE Linux Enterprise-based systems are not impacted if they have recently been patched. The patches provided for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169 also take care of these new issues. [CVE-2014-6277](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6277) and [CVE-2014-6278](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278) describe these new issues in greater detail. More information is also available at this [knowledgebase entry](/support/kb/doc?id=7015714).

#### What's the best way to make sure I always receive security updates for all my SUSE Linux Enterprise-based systems as quickly as possible?

The best way is to ensure that you have active subscriptions for all your systems and are running current versions that are within their support life cycle. If you need to run an older version that is out of its standard life cycle, you should purchase extended life cycle support, such as our LTSS offering. For more information on purchasing subscriptions and LTSS, contact your SUSE sales representative or partner.

        This module exploits a shellshock vulnerability on Qmail, a public
        domain MTA written in C that runs on Unix systems.
        Due to the lack of validation on the MAIL FROM field, it is possible to
        execute shell code on a system with a vulnerable BASH (Shellshock).
        This flaw works on the latest Qmail versions (qmail-1.03 and
        netqmail-1.06).
        However, in order to execute code, /bin/sh has to be linked to bash
        (usually default configuration) and a valid recipient must be set on the
        RCPT TO field (usually admin@exampledomain.com).
        The exploit does not work on the "qmailrocks" community version
        as it ensures the MAILFROM field is well-formed.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Malware is circulating that exploits the shellshock security vulnerability

Updated 2014-09-29T13:28:34+00:00 -
English

* [English](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1213683)
* [Japanese](https://access.redhat.com/ja/articles/1370363)

A variety of malware is in circulation that exploits systems that are not fully patched for the shellshock security vulnerability. Some of this malware is connecting vulnerable systems to a [distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) botnet](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.itnews.com.au%2FNews%2F396197%2Cfirst-shellshock-botnet-attacks-akamai-us-dod-networks.aspx). Please ensure that your systems are all [fully patched](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1207723) to ensure you are not susceptible to this malware.

To determine whether your systems are vulnerable to the shellshock vulnerability, use Red Hat's [Shellshock Vulnerability Detector](https://access.redhat.com/labs/shellshock/).

Even if your systems are no longer vulnerable, they may have been previously compromised. To determine whether your systems are infected with shellshock malware, it is recommended that you perform a scan using a third-party anti-virus tool of your choosing. There are [multiple](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alienvault.com%2Fopen-threat-exchange%2Fblog%2Fattackers-exploiting-shell-shock-cve-2014-6721-in-the-wild) [articles](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fireeye.com%2Fblog%2Funcategorized%2F2014%2F09%2Fshellshock-in-the-wild.html) [analyzing](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.sucuri.net%2F2014%2F09%2Fbash-shellshocker-attacks-increase-in-the-wild-day-1.html) particular malware variants that exploit the shellshock vulnerability.

If your systems are already compromised by shellshock-based malware, you need to take immediate action. You can't be certain exactly what that attacker has changed or installed on your system. You should back up your data, image storage devices, and reinstall from scratch to ensure no trace of the attacker is left on your system. This guide from CERT will give you more details about the process you should follow in recovering from a compromise:

**アップデート: 2014/09/26 5:15 UTC**

Red Hat は、[CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) に対応するパッチが不十分であること認識しています。攻撃者は、特定の状況下で脆弱なシステムで実行する恣意的なコマンドを含む特別に作られた環境変数を提供できます。この新しい問題は [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) で対応しています。

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4、5、6、および 7、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 Long Life、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.9 Extended Update Support、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 Advanced Update Support、Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 Extended Update Support、そして Shift\_JIS for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 および 6 のサブスクリプションをお持ちの場合は、[CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) に対応した bash パッケージのアップデート版をご利用いただけます。また、[Resolution for Bash Code Injection Vulnerability via Specially Crafted Environment Variables (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169) in Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://access.redhat.com/node/1207723) も併せて参照してください。

## 診断手順

Shellshock 脆弱性に対応するパッチがシステムに適用されているかどうかを確認するために、Red Hat Access Labs で[スクリプト](https://access.redhat.com/labs/shellshock/)が提供されています。また、以下のコマンドを実行すると、使用している Bash のバージョンを手動でテストできます。

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"

```

使用している Bash のバージョンに脆弱性が含まれる場合は、このコマンドを実行すると `vulnerable` という文字だけが表示されます。この問題を修正するパッチを使用すると、Bash 関数終了後にいかなるコードも許可しません。

このコマンドを実行した時に表示される警告メッセージの内容は、 使用している Bash のバージョンによって異なります。修正されていないバージョンをお使いの場合は、以下のように出力されます。

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
vulnerable
bash:BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
bash:BASH_FUNC_x(): line 0:`BASH_FUNC_x() () { :;}; echo vulnerable'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

オリジナルの CVE-2014-6271 修正だけを適用した場合は、以下の出力が生成されます。

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x()'
test

```

[RHSA-2014:1306](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html)、[RHSA-2014:1311](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html)、および [RHSA-2014:1312](https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html) で提供されている追加の修正パッチをインストールすると、以下のような結果が出力されます。

```

$ env 'x=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' 'BASH_FUNC_x()=() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo test"
bash: warning: x: ignoring function definition attempt
bash: error importing function definition for `BASH_FUNC_x'
test

```

出力内容は、下記の「この問題は、システムにどのような影響を与えますか?」セクションで説明されている関数処理が変更されているため異なります。

CVE-2014-7169 の修正を適用すると、ファイル作成問題からシステムを保護します。以下のコマンドを実行すると、お使いの Bash が CVE-2014-7169 問題の影響を受けるかどうかをテストできます。

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
bash: x: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `='
bash: x: line 1:`'
bash: error importing function definition for `x'
Fri Sep 26 11:49:58 GMT 2014

```

システムが**脆弱な状態**だと画面に日時が表示され、/tmp/echo ファイルが作成されます。

システムに脆弱性問題が含まれない場合は、以下のような結果が出力されます。

```

$ cd /tmp; rm -f /tmp/echo; env 'x=() { (a)=>\' bash -c "echo date"; cat /tmp/echo
date
cat:/tmp/echo:No such file or directory

```

システムが脆弱な状態の場合は、以下のコマンドを実行して bash パッケージの最新バージョンをアップデートすると、この問題を修正できます。

```
# yum update bash

```
## この問題は、システムにどのような影響を与えますか?

この問題は、Bash シェルを使用し、環境変数の値を解析するすべての製品に影響します。この問題は、アプリケーションが Bash を呼び出す手段は数多く存在するため、特に危険です。アプリケーションが他のバイナリを実行する場合は、その実行のために頻繁に Bash が呼び出されます。これは、Bash シェルの一般的な使用方法であるためこの問題は非常に危険であり、その認識で対応する必要があります。

この問題に対応するアップデートとして一覧に挙げられているバージョン以前のバージョンはすべて、ある程度影響を受けます。

詳細については、修正内容を記載した各記事を参照してください。

CVE-2014-7169 のパッチを適用すると、Bash が環境変数を評価する方法が変更します。Bash 関数を環境変数として直接作成するアプリケーションに、これらの変更を認識させる必要があります。従来、関数は同じ名前の環境変数に保存する必要がありました。たとえば、関数 "compute" は、"compute" という名前の環境変数に保存されます。CVE-2014-7169 のパッチを適用すると、名前は "BASH\_FUNC\_compute()" となります。その結果、"BASH\_FUNC\_compute()=() { }" のように、環境文字列で 2 つの括弧が使用されます。

Bash で作成される関数は、"export -f" でエクスポートされる場合でも、変更する必要はありません。Bash は、エクスポート時に適切な命名を透過的に適用し、関数定義のインポート時にプロセスを無効にします。

このような環境変数を作成するサービスは、新しいバージョンの Bash を使用するように再起動する必要があります。ただし、この方法は、Red Hat Enterprise Linux のすべてのバージョンで提供されているパッケージには使用されていません。

### 影響を受ける製品:

### 一般的な設定例:

Red Hat は、この問題の重大度と、様々な設定にどう影響するか理解を深めるために解析を行いました。以下の表は包括的ではありませんが、特定の設定下でのこの問題の影響例と、非常に複雑であるため、この問題に影響しないものを特定するのが不可能な理由について説明しています。最も推奨される方法は、Bash を修正されたバージョンにアップグレードすることです。

| パッケージ | 説明 |
| --- | --- |
| httpd | CGI スクリプトがこの問題に影響される可能性は高いです。 CGI スクリプトを web サーバーで実行すると、このスクリプトは環境変数を使用してスクリプトにデーターを渡します。攻撃者は、この環境変数を制御できます。CGI スクリプトが Bash を呼び出すと、このスクリプトは恣意的なコードを httpd ユーザーとして実行できます。mod\_php、mod\_perl、および mod\_python は環境変数を使用しないため、影響を受けないと考えられます。 |
| Secure シェル(SSH) | rsync や git などの SSH を使用してユーザーが実行できるリモートコマンドを制限するのは珍しくありません。この時、この脆弱性を利用して、制限されたコマンドだけでなく、いずれのコマンドを実行できます。 |
| dhclient | Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Client (dhclient) を使用して、ネットワーク設定情報を DHCP から自動的に取得します。このクライアントはさまざまな環境変数を使用し、Bash を実行してネットワークインターフェイスを設定します。攻撃者は、悪意のある DHCP サーバーに接続して、クライアントマシンで恣意的なコードを実行できます。 |
| CUPS | CUPS はこの問題の影響を受けると考えられています。cups フィルターを実行する時に、ユーザーが提供するさまざまな値が環境変数に保存されます。 |
| sudo | sudo から実行したコマンドはこの問題の影響を受けません。特に、sudo は、関数でもある環境変数を探します。これにより、Bash の子プロセスが恣意的なコードを実行できるように、実行中のコマンドが環境変数を設定でます。 |
| Firefox | Firefox では、Bash が恣意的なコマンドを実行できるように環境変数を設定できるとは考えられていません。ただし、この操作を許可するさまざまなプラグインと拡張子をインストールするのが一般的であるため、Bash をアップグレードすることが推奨されます。 |
| Postfix | Postfix サーバーは、さまざまな文字を ? に置き換えます。Postfix サーバーはさまざまな方法で Bash を呼び出しますが、このサーバーによって恣意的な環境変数を設定できるとは考えられません。ただし、フィルターが環境変数を設定できる可能性はあります。 |

## よくある質問

この FAQ は、Bash の脆弱性 CVE-2014-6271 に関するものです。

CVE-2014-6271 および CVE-2014-7169 に関する追加情報は、<https://securityblog.redhat.com/2014/09/26/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-shellshock-bash-flaws/> を参照してください。

RHEL 4 Standard または Premium エンタイトルメントをお持ちで ELS をお持ちでないお客様に関する補足情報については、<https://access.redhat.com/discussions/1211573> を参照してください。

### CVE が 6 つに別れているのはなぜですか?

Bash に関する最初の不具合は [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) で対応しています。この問題が公開された直後に、最初の修正で阻止できない同様の不具合が発見され、[CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) で対応しています。その後、Red Hat Product Security の Researcher である Florian Weimer がさらなる問題を発見し、[CVE-2014-7186](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186) および [CVE-2014-7187](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7187) で対応しています。その後、不具合が 2 つ報告されました。その詳細は現在公開されていませんが、[CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277) および [CVE-2014-6278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278) で対応しています。最初の 4 つの不具合は、現在利用できる最新の Bash パッケージで修正されましたが、残りの 2 つは緩和しかされません。この (英語版の) 記事が作成された時点 (2014/09/30) では、これらの Bash パッケージが攻撃を受けるセキュリティの不具合は報告されていません。これらの不具合の最新情報については、CVE ページを参照してください。

### 所有するシステムがこの脆弱性の影響を受ける可能性があります。どうすれば良いですか?

パッチを当てた後も、このナレッジに記載されている診断手順を実行してシステムが脆弱な状態であると返される場合、またはシステムが脆弱であると思われる場合は、[Red Hat サポートケースを作成](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/new)するか、[電話](https://access.redhat.com/support/contact/technicalSupport)にてサポートチームにご連絡ください。

### CVE-2014-6271 および CVE-2014-7169 のアップデートをインストールした後、システムまたはサービスを再起動する必要はありますか?

エクスポートされた Bash 機能を使用している場合は、影響を受けるサービスを再起動することが推奨されます。影響を受けるインタラクティブなユーザーが再ログインしたり、画面または tmux セッションを再起動したりする必要があるかもしれません。

これらの問題を修正するために提供された Bash アップデートは、この環境でエクスポートされた関数の名前を変更します。古いバージョンの Bash が関数をエクスポートしている場合、その関数はアップデート後に新しく起動した Bash プロセスでは認識されないため、定義されていない状態になります。サービスを再起動すると、新しいバージョンの Bashは、期待した名前で関数をエクスポートするため、再度表示されます。

どのサービスを再起動する必要があるか (またはどのユーザーの再ログインが必要か) を特定するには、アップデート後に以下のコマンドを実行してください。

```
$ grep -l -z '[^)]=() {' /proc/[1-9]*/environ | cut -d/ -f3
```

このコマンドから返される PID は、以前エクスポートされた関数定義を使用するプロセスに属しています。したがって、これらのプロセスは再起動する必要があります。特定の PID を開始したサービスを特定するには、再起動が必要になります。 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 で、以下のコマンドを実行します。

```
$ systemctl status <PID>
```

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 以前の場合は、`pstree -p` または `ps -axuf` コマンドを実行して、特定の PID を探します。

### 他のシェルは、この問題の影響を受けますか?

Red Hat は、この問題について、他のシェルをテストしました。Bash に見られた動作を再現することはできませんでした。今後、他のシェルで同様の問題が見つかった場合は、必要に応じてアップデートをリリースします。

### この問題を緩和する方法はありませんか?

アップデートされたパッケージをインストールできない場合は、潜在的な緩和方法の詳細について、[Mitigating the shellshock vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169)](https://access.redhat.com/articles/1212303) を参照してください。最善の方法は、現在報告されているすべての脆弱性に対処できるため、利用できる最新のパッケージ (上述) をインストールすることです。

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1295)

## Topic

Updated bash Shift\_JIS packages that fix one security issue are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Critical security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

The GNU Bourne Again shell (Bash) is a shell and command language
interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell (sh). Bash is the default
shell for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

Shift\_JIS, also known as "SJIS", is a character encoding for the Japanese
language. This package provides bash support for the Shift\_JIS encoding.

A flaw was found in the way Bash evaluated certain specially crafted
environment variables. An attacker could use this flaw to override or
bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands. Certain
services and applications allow remote unauthenticated attackers to
provide environment variables, allowing them to exploit this issue.
(CVE-2014-6271)

For additional information on the CVE-2014-6271 flaw, refer to the
Knowledgebase article at <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223>

Red Hat would like to thank Stephane Chazelas for reporting this issue.

All users who require Shift\_JIS encoding support with Bash built-in
functions are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a
backported patch to correct this issue.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the

Vantage Point Security Advisory 2015-001
========================================

Title: Cisco Unified Communications Manager Multiple Vulnerabilities
Vendor: Cisco
Vendor URL: http://www.cisco.com/
Versions affected:  <9.2, <10.5.2, <11.0.1.
Severity: Low to medium
Vendor notified: Yes
Reported: Oct. 2014
Public release: Aug. 13th, 2015
Author: Bernhard Mueller <bernhard[at]vantagepoint[dot]sg>

Summary:
--------

Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) offers services such as session
management, voice, video, messaging, mobility, and web conferencing.

During the last year, Vantage Point Security has reported four security
issues to Cisco as listed below.

1. Shellshock command injection
--------------------------------

Authenticated users of CUCM can access limited functionality via the web
interface and Cisco console (SSH on port 22). Because the SSH server is
configured to process several environment variables from the client and a
vulnerable version of bash is used, it is possible to exploit command
injection via specially crafted environment variables (CVE-2014-6271 a.k.a.
shellshock). This allows an attacker to spawn a shell running as the user
"admin".

Several environment variables can be used to exploit the issue. Example:

$ LC_PAPER="() { x;};/bin/sh" ssh Administrator@examplecucm.com

2. Local File Inclusion
-----------------------

The application allows users to view the contents of any locally accessible
files on the web server through a vulnerability known as LFI (Local File
Inclusion). LFI vulnerabilities are commonly used to download application
source code, configuration files and files containing sensitive information
such as passwords. Exploiting this issue requires a valid user account.

https://cucm.example.com/:8443/reporter-servlet/GetFileContent?Location=/&FileName=/usr/local/thirdparty/jakarta-tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml

3. Unauthenticated access to ping command
-----------------------------------------

The pingExecute servlet allows unauthenticated users to execute pings to
arbitrary IP addresses. This could be used by an attacker to enumerate the
internal network. The following URL triggers a ping of the host 10.0.0.1:

https://cucm.example.com:8443/cmplatform/pingExecute?hostname=10.0.0.1&interval=1.0&packetsize=12&count=1000&secure=false

4. Magic session ID allows unauthenticated access to SOAP calls
---------------------------------------------------------------

Authentication for some methods in the EPAS SOAP interface can be bypassed
by using a hardcoded session ID. The methods "GetUserLoginInfoHandler" and
"GetLoggedinXMPPUserHandler" are affected.

Fix Information:
----------------

Upgrade to CUCM version 9.2, 10.5.2 or 11.0.1.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1146319#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-09-25 02:05:41 UTC  ``` It was found the patch applied to fix [CVE-2014-6271](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6271) was incomplete and could still allow some characters to be injected into another environment. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass some security restrictions, such as access files which he previously does not have access to etc (Standard file system permissions and selinux if enabled prevail though). There is no proof that this flaw could be used to execute arbitrary code, if it does it should be very difficult to exploit and depend on the specific configuration of the service.

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Security Advisory 0006 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1008-security-advisory-0006?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** September 29th 2014

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | September 29th 2014 | Initial release |
| 1.1 | September 30th 2014 | Additional details on maintenance releases |
| 1.2 | October 29th 2014 | Additional details on fixed releases |
| 1.3 | November 4th 2014 | Additional details on fixed releases |

**Shell command Bash code injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-6278, and CVE-2014-7169)**

On September 24th, Arista became aware of a vulnerability affecting all versions of the bash package shipped with Arista EOS. The bash code injection vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain shell access.

Arista switches are only vulnerable to administrators with current access to the switch CLI. The switch is not vulnerable to remote attack.

A software patch (RPM extension) is available for download. In addition fixes will be integrated for each currently supported version of EOS through regular maintenance releases. Currently supported versions of EOS include 4.9 through 4.14.

BugID’s 99948 and 99949 address the issue.

All models of the Arista 7000 Series of fixed and modular systems are affected.

| EOS Releases Affected | Fixed in | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.9.0 through 4.9.11 | 4.9.12 | Pending Release |
| 4.10.0 through 4.10.8 | 4.10.9 | Pending Release |
| 4.11.0 through 4.11.10 | 4.11.11 | Released |
| 4.12 through 4.12.8 | 4.12.9 | Released |
| 4.13 through 4.13.8 | 4.13.9 | Released |
| 4.14.0 through 4.14.3 | 4.14.4F | Released |

**Workaround:**
 Available mitigations include restricting access to a set of known trusted users, restricting ssh logins to trusted source IP addresses, and temporarily removing remote access to users with non privileged access.

Customers using Arista’s DHCP extensions or using dhclient in a custom setup may wish to disable the extension if it passes DHCP parameters to bash as environment variables.

**Verification:**
 To determine if the version of EOS is vulnerable use the following command:

```
switch# bash

-bash-4.1# X='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"

X='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"

vulnerable

this is a test
```

If the output of the above command contains a line containing the word “vulnerable” you are using a vulnerable version of Bash. The patch used to fix this issue ensures that no code is allowed after the end of a Bash function.

**Resolution:**

The resolution to this issue is through the installation of a patch, or through upgrading to a version of EOS that contains the resolution. This section will be updated once EOS maintenance releases are available. A patch is currently available.

Download URL for patch:

**Instructions to install the patch for Security Advisory 0006**

The extension is applicable for all EOS versions 4.9.0 - 4.14.3 inclusive.

Step 1. Copy the file secAdvisory0006.swix to the extension partition of the Arista switch using any of the supported file transfer protocols:

```
switch#copy scp://This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it./home/arista/secAdvisory0006.swix extension:
```

Step 2. Ensure that the file has been copied to the extensions partition and verify the checksum of the copied file:

```
switch#show extensions

Name          Version/Release          Status<          RPMs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
secAdvisory0006.swix secAdvisory0006.swix          4.1.14Ar/4.fc14          A, NI          1

A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F:forced

```

To verify the extension, compare the following sha512 or md5 checksum with the output of the verify command:

```
sha512sum: 3cf25bb085c3b3bb84430257887e0ee75f4abe52968d093258ce65cad95450e8163b374429da81db0cecccf344bcb469354fbfa0bc0c9651a33c7b509f89f88f
```
```
md5sum:
084606719ce59e65fb383ad99c50d186
```

**verify commands:**

```
switch#verify /sha512 extension:secAdvisory0006.swix
verify /sha512 (extension:secAdvisory0006.swix) = 3cf25bb085c3b3bb84430257887e0ee75f4abe52968d093258ce65cad95450e8163b374429da81db0cecccf344bcb469354fbfa0bc0c9651a33c7b509f89f88f
```
```
switch#verify /md5 extension:secAdvisory0006.swix
verify /md5 (extension:secAdvisory0006.swix) =
084606719ce59e65fb383ad99c50d186
```

Step 3. The patch is installed as an extension, and upon installation into a live system will automatically install with the following behavior:

```
switch#extension secAdvisory0006.swix
```

All modular switches with dual supervisors require the extension copying and installing on both supervisors.

Verify that the extension has been installed:

```
switch#show extensions

Name          Version/Release          Status          RPMs
----------------------------------------------------------------
secAdvisory0006.swix          4.1.14Ar/4.fc14          A, I           1

A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F: forced

```

Step 4. Post installation, any newly initialized shell sessions will use the fixed version of bash.

Note: As the vulnerability exists only during the startup of a new bash instance, existing running shell instances are unlikely to be affected. Existing bash scripts running as part of a custom setup may be restarted to ensure use of the new version of bash.

Step 5. Make the extension persist across reboots:

```
switch#copy installed-extensions boot-extensions
Copy completed successfully.
switch#show boot-extensions
secAdvisory0006.swix
```

Verification of the bash version after resolution:

```
switch#show version detail  | grep -i bash
bash 4.1.14Ar 4.fc14
```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=868822#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-03-18 07:00:55 UTC  ``` via oss-sec  From: Steve Kemp <steve@steve.org.uk> Subject: [oss-security] Insecure usage of temporary files in GNU Readline Date: Fri, 14 Mar 2014 18:05:31 +0000     Whilst auditing some code for insecure uses of temporary  files I spotted a potential area of concern in GNU readline.  (via an embedded copy of the same inside the Debian source  of GDB.)    The code in question comes from readline 6.x and is contained  in util.c:   int _rl_tropen () {   char fnbuf[128];    if (_rl_tracefp)     fclose (_rl_tracefp);   sprintf (fnbuf, "/var/tmp/rltrace.%ld", getpid());   unlink(fnbuf);   _rl_tracefp = fopen (fnbuf, "w+");   return _rl_tracefp != 0; }     _rl_tropen is invoked from _rl_trace, which is a debugging aid,  and it is implied that the function is private, because it is defined  in rlprivate.h:  /* rlprivate.h -- functions and variables global to the readline library,           but not intended for use by applications. */    That said the function _is_ available for using/linking, as  a trivial test program would demonstrate:         <http://pastebin.com/T0XimKED>   Given how widely used this library is potentially many applications are  unknowingly vulnerable to a classic race-condition.    I'm throwing this out there for two reasons:      * In theory this is exploitable, and should be fixed.      * In practice I cannot find an application which invokes _rl_trace,       although there are tantalising clues such as this page of commits       which refers to a snapshot of GNU Bash:              <https://gitlab.com/bminor/bash/commit/b0c16657b4514191b4f6c328615d162726758247>     Feel free to allocate an identifier, or even scan some of your  projects that have readline dependencies ;)     This is the first announcement of this issue I've made, I can  imagine some more paranoid distributions might wish to update, but  equally this seems so low-risk that I didn't consider it worthy  of vendor-sec.

RESOLUTION

HP is actively working on a firmware update to resolve the vulnerability in
HP StoreFabric H-series switches. This bulletin will be revised when the
update is available.

  MITIGATION INFORMATION

    HP recommends the following steps to reduce the risk of this
vulnerability:

      - Place the HP StoreFabric H-series switch and other data center
critical infrastructure behind a firewall to disallow access from the
Internet.
      - Change all HP StoreFabric switch default account passwords, including
the root passwords, from the default factory passwords.
      - Examine the list of accounts, including ones on the switch and those
existing on remote authentication servers such as RADIUS, LDAP, and TACAS+,
to ensure only necessary personnel can gain access to HP StoreFabric H-series
switches. Delete guest accounts and temporary accounts created for one-time
usage needs.
      - To avoid possible exploit through the embedded web GUI, QuickTools,
disable the web server with the following procedure:

        NOTE: After completing this procedure, the user will not be able to
manage the switch using QuickTools.

        1. Login to the Command Line Interface (CLI).
        2. Execute the "admin start" command to enter into an admin session.
        3. Execute the "set setup services" command and change setting for
EmbeddedGUIEnabled to "False".
