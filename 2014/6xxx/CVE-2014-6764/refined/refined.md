    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improperly validating SSL certificate chains, leading to man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerabilities."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network may view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS, potentially leading to credential theft or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker intercepts network traffic between the Android device and the server.",

    "testing_methodology": "Applications were tested using CERT Tapioca, as described in the CERT/CC blog.",
    "affected_applications": "A large number of Android applications were found to be vulnerable, with a detailed list available in a separate spreadsheet. A total of 23667 out of 1000462 tested apps failed dynamic testing. ",
    "solution": "Apply updates for the affected applications. If updates are not available, users are advised to not use affected applications and to avoid untrusted networks such as public WiFi."
