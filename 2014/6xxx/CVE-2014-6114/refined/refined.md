- **Root cause of vulnerability**: XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when processing XML data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to XXE injection, which allows an attacker to declare an entity referencing a local file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information by exploiting the XXE vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can inject malicious XML content containing an external entity reference to read local files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send crafted XML data to the vulnerable application.
