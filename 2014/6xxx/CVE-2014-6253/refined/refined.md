{
  "CVE-2014-6253": {
    "Root cause": "Lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the Zenoss Core application.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can force a user to perform actions without their knowledge. By tricking a user into visiting a malicious page, the attacker can embed malicious content that automatically performs POST or GET requests on behalf of the authenticated user. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary actions within the application.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can coerce a user to visit a malicious page with embedded content that triggers a POST or GET request to the vulnerable application. Additionally, XSS vulnerabilities on the site can be leveraged for this attack by forcing a user to view content on the control center site.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into visiting a malicious webpage, or exploit an existing XSS vulnerability on the target website."
