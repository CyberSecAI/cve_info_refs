Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6368:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's improper implementation of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), a security feature designed to make it harder for attackers to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the failure to properly utilize ASLR. This allows an attacker to more accurately predict memory offsets, which is critical for reliably exploiting other vulnerabilities. This is classified as a Security Feature Bypass (SFB).

**Impact of exploitation:**
By itself, the ASLR bypass does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, it significantly increases the exploitability of other vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution flaws, that might otherwise be difficult to exploit due to ASLR. An attacker could use the ASLR bypass to make code execution more reliable.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to lure a user into visiting a specially crafted website using an affected version of Internet Explorer. This requires a user to be logged on and running an affected version of Internet Explorer. The ASLR bypass vulnerability would then allow for other memory corruption vulnerabilities to be more reliably exploited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and convince a user to visit that website while using an affected version of Internet Explorer. Successful exploitation would also require another vulnerability such as a remote code execution to be present.
