- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers could host specially crafted websites designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince users to visit these sites. Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content could also be used to deliver the exploit. Attackers could use email or instant messages to trick users into clicking links or opening attachments that lead to malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage. They can use social engineering techniques through email or IM, or leverage compromised websites.
