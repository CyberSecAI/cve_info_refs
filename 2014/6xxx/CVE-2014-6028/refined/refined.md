Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-6028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control when retrieving user cookies within the `torrentflux` web application. The `getCookie` function in `torrentflux/www/functions.php` at line 395 is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application allows an authenticated user to access cookies of other users by manipulating the `cid` (cookie ID) parameter in the `profile.php?op=editCookies` URL. By iterating through different `cid` values, an attacker can retrieve cookies of all users stored in the database.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive cookie information, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** By obtaining other users' cookies, an attacker could impersonate those users and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can use stolen cookies to hijack active user sessions, potentially leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-based Attack:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the `torrentflux` application.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `cid` parameter in the `profile.php?op=editCookies` URL to access other user's cookies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the `torrentflux` web application to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL structure (`profile.php?op=editCookies&cid=<ITERATOR>`) to iterate and retrieve other user's cookies.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Nicolas Guigo from iSEC Partners.
*   The vulnerability was found in `torrentflux` version 2.4.5-1.
*   The issue was addressed by removing the package from Debian archive unstable as a fix was not implemented.
*   It was also noted that it is possible to delete or modify cookies using a similar method and was later assigned CVE-2014-6029.
