The provided content is related to CVE-2014-6860.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This occurs when applications do not verify that the certificate presented by a server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Untrusted networks, such as public WiFi, increase the chance of MITM attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
