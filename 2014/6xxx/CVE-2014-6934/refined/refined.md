The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6934, which is a placeholder for a description regarding Android apps failing to properly validate SSL certificates.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means that they do not verify that the certificate provided by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain.
- Failure to ensure the certificate comes from a trusted CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential theft.
- Possible arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploiting the lack of SSL certificate validation in the Android application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic.
