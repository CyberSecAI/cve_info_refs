The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6705.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Lack of verification of the SSL chain against a trusted root certificate authority.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
- View or modification of network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing
- Potential arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- Public WiFi or untrusted networks increase the risk of exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- This typically means the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the victim.
