Subject: Docker 1.3.2 - Security Advisory [24 Nov 2014]

Today, we are releasing Docker 1.3.2 in order to address two critical
security issues. This release also includes several bugfixes, including
changes to the insecure-registry option. Below are CVE descriptions for the
vulnerabilities addressed in this release.

Docker 1.3.2 is available immediately for all supported platforms:
<https://docs.docker.com/installation/>

Docker Security Advisory [24 Nov 2014]
=================================================================

=====================================================
[CVE-2014-6407] Archive extraction allowing host privilege escalation
=====================================================
Severity: Critical
Affects: Docker up to 1.3.1

The Docker engine, up to and including version 1.3.1, was vulnerable to
extracting files to arbitrary paths on the host during ‘docker pull’ and
‘docker load’ operations. This was caused by symlink and hardlink
traversals present in Docker's image extraction. This vulnerability could
be leveraged to perform remote code execution and privilege escalation.

Docker 1.3.2 remedies this vulnerability. Additional checks have been added
to pkg/archive and image extraction is now performed in a chroot. No
remediation is available for older versions of Docker and users are advised
to upgrade.

Related vulnerabilities discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
Security and independent researcher, Tõnis Tiigi.

=================================================================
[CVE-2014-6408] Security options applied to image could lead to container
escalation
=================================================================
Severity: Critical
Affects: Docker 1.3.0-1.3.1

Docker versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.1 allowed security options to be applied
to images, allowing images to modify the default run profile of containers
executing these images. This vulnerability could allow a malicious image
creator to loosen the restrictions applied to a container’s processes,
potentially facilitating a break-out.

Docker 1.3.2 remedies this vulnerability. Security options applied to
images are no longer consumed by the Docker engine and will be ignored.
Users are advised to upgrade.

=================================================================
Other changes:
=================================================================

Besides the above CVEs, the 1.3.2 release allows administrators to pass a
CIDR-formatted range of addresses for '—insecure-registry'. In addition,
allowing a cleartext registry to exist on localhost is now default
behavior. This change was made due to user feedback following the changes
made in 1.3.1 to resolve CVE-2014-5277.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=907012#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2014-11-25 09:08:06 UTC  ``` The Docker engine, up to and including version 1.3.1, was vulnerable to extracting files to arbitrary paths on the host during ‘docker pull’ and ‘docker load’ operations. This was caused by symlink and hardlink traversals present in Docker's image extraction. This vulnerability could be leveraged to perform remote code execution and privilege escalation.  Docker 1.3.2 remedies this vulnerability. Additional checks have been added to pkg/archive and image extraction is now performed in a chroot. No remediation is available for older versions of Docker and users are advised to upgrade.  Affects SLE 12 and openSUSE 13.2. Requires using an untrusted external repo, which is a bad idea anyway.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=907014#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2014-11-25 09:10:25 UTC  ``` Docker versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.1 allowed security options to be applied to images, allowing images to modify the default run profile of containers executing these images. This vulnerability could allow a malicious image creator to loosen the restrictions applied to a container’s processes, potentially facilitating a break-out.  Docker 1.3.2 remedies this vulnerability. Security options applied to images are no longer consumed by the Docker engine and will be ignored. Users are advised to upgrade.  --  Affects SLE 12 and openSUSE 13.2. Requires using an untrusted external repo, which is a bad idea anyway.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for docker
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1596-1
Rating: important
References: #907012 #907014
Cross-References: CVE-2014-6407 CVE-2014-6408
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
docker was updated to version 1.3.2 to fix two security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- Symbolic and hardlink issues leading to privilege escalation
(CVE-2014-6407).
- Potential container escalation (CVE-2014-6408).
There non-security issues were fixed:
- Fix deadlock in docker ps -f exited=1
- Fix a bug when --volumes-from references a container that failed to start
- --insecure-registry now accepts CIDR notation such as 10.1.0.0/16
- Private registries whose IPs fall in the 127.0.0.0/8 range do no need
the --insecure-registry flag
- Skip the experimental registry v2 API when mirroring is enabled
- Fixed minor packaging issues.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2014-757
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".
Package List:
- openSUSE 13.2 (x86\_64):
docker-1.3.2-9.1
docker-debuginfo-1.3.2-9.1
docker-debugsource-1.3.2-9.1
- openSUSE 13.2 (noarch):
docker-bash-completion-1.3.2-9.1
docker-zsh-completion-1.3.2-9.1
