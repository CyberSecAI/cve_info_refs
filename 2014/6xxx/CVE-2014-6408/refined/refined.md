Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-6408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Docker versions 1.3.0 through 1.3.1 allowed security options to be applied to images. These options could modify the default run profile of containers created from these images.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The vulnerability lies in Docker's handling of security options applied to images. These options were improperly processed, allowing a malicious image creator to weaken container security settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  A malicious actor could create a Docker image with security options that loosen the restrictions applied to the container's processes.
-  This could enable a container breakout, potentially granting the attacker control of the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a malicious image creator crafting an image with altered security options.
-  When a user pulls and runs a container based on this compromised image, the weakened security profile is applied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a malicious Docker image.
-  The attacker does not need direct access to the target system or Docker environment, but they do need to convince a user to run their image.
