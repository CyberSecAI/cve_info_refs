## Vulnerability in Microsoft Graphics Component Could Allow Information Disclosure (3013126)

Published: December 9, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user browses to a website containing specially crafted JPEG content. An attacker could use this information disclosure vulnerability to gain information about the system that could then be combined with other attacks to compromise the system. The information disclosure vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this information disclosure vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability to bypass security features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR).

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The update addresses the vulnerability by changing how memory is initialized and managed when JPEG images are decoded. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section.

For more information about this document, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3013126](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3013126).

## Vulnerability Information

## Graphics Component Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2014-6355

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Graphics Component that could allow an attacker to more reliably predict the memory offsets of specific instructions in a given call stack. The vulnerability is caused when the Microsoft Graphics Component improperly handles the decoding of [JPEG](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) images in memory. An attacker could use this information disclosure vulnerability to gain information about the system that could then be combined with other attacks to compromise the system. The information disclosure vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use this information disclosure vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability to bypass security features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The security update addresses the vulnerability by changing how memory is initialized and managed when JPEG images are decoded.

This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2013-6355](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-6355). When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.
