- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of JPEG image decoding in memory by the Microsoft Graphics Component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure vulnerability. Specifically, the vulnerability allows an attacker to predict memory offsets of instructions in a call stack more reliably.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain information about the system that could be combined with other attacks to compromise the system. It can be used to bypass security features such as Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). However, the information disclosure vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious JPEG image and hosting it on a website. When a user browses to this website, the vulnerable graphics component attempts to decode the image, triggering the information disclosure.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a website and lure a victim to browse to it. The attacker also requires the ability to craft a malicious JPEG image.
