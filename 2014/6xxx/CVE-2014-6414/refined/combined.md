## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-neutron security, bug fix, and enhancement update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1786)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue, several
bugs, and add multiple enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

It was discovered that unprivileged users could in some cases reset
admin-only network attributes to their default values. This could lead to
unexpected behavior or in some cases result in a denial of service.
(CVE-2014-6414)

The openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149742)

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Neutron

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although an
advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Admin-only network attributes may be reset to defaults by
non-privileged users
Reporter: Elena Ezhova (Mirantis)
Products: Neutron
Versions: up to 2013.2.4 and 2014.1 versions up to 2014.1.2

Description:
Elena Ezhova from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Neutron. By updating
a network attribute with a default value a non-privileged user may reset
admin-only network attributes. This may lead to unexpected behavior with
security implications for operators with a custom policy.json, or in some
extreme cases network outages resulting in denial of service. All
deployments using neutron networking are affected by this flaw.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Neutron

There is a known issue in all Havana releases that results in Neutron DHCP agent constantly resyncing its state once a network and a subnet
is created with a gateway outside of it. To avoid this, users are encouraged to set force\_gateway\_on\_subnet to True in neutron.conf. [https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/+bug/1304181](https://bugs.launchpad.net/neutron/%2Bbug/1304181)

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1785)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue, several
bugs, and add multiple enhancements are now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

It was discovered that unprivileged users could in some cases reset
admin-only network attributes to their default values. This could lead to
unexpected behavior or in some cases result in a denial of service.
(CVE-2014-6414)

The openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version
2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the
previous version. (BZ#1149753)

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

### Bug Description

If a non-admin user tries to update an attribute, which should be updated only by admin, from a non-default value to default, the update is successfully performed and PolicyNotAuthorized exception is not raised.

The reason is that when a rule to match for a given action is built there is a verification that each attribute in a body of the resource is present and has a non-default value. Thus, if we try to change some attribute's value to default, it is not considered to be explicitly set and a corresponding rule is not enforced.

Setting as private security as soon as Eugene made me aware of the bug.

This might allow users to reset arbitrary attributes to default values - which could be a security threat.

It has been in the open for about 50 minutes. I don't know if the security private flag still makes sense. But I don't know if there's a policy around that.

@Salvatore Well the policy is Once public, Forever public... Thus I'll mark this bug as Public security.

This bug is concerning, do we know how many release are impacted ?

This is a behaviour which has always been in the system.

I am looking at the patch to understand the exact scope.

I have verified that users still won't be allowed to un-share networks or make ext networks internals, which would cause immediate disruption in a cloud - this won't happen because the user will not own the object in the first place.

For instance this can allow users to restore SNAT on routers where the provider has disabled it (not a big deal - networking should just stop working in that case)

Another example is that a user can un-distribute a distributed router - again no big deal but this would however make the router not functional.

Even if it's not the end of the world, it's good to keep this bug as public security as deployers might be running customized policy.json files, and therefore might experience unexpected and possibly security-threatening behaviours.

Draft impact description:

Title: Administrator only network attributes may be reset to defaults by non-privileged users

Reporter: Elena Ezhova (Mirantis)

Products: Neutron

Versions: up to 2014.2

Description:

Elena Ezhova from Mirantis reported a vulnerability in Neutron. By updating a network attribute with a default value a non-privileged user may reset admin-only network attributes. This may lead to unexpected behavior with security implications for operators with a custom policy.json, or in some cases network outages resulting in denial of service. All deployments using neutron networking are affected by this flaw.

Title: Administrator only -> "Admin-only"

Desc: "some cases" -> "some extreme cases" (as we don't even know of such a case iiuc)

Versions: I think both havana and icehouse are affected, so this should mention 2014.1 up to... and 2013.2.x up to...

Otherwise looks good

Grant's impact description from comment #10 looks fine to me, though with Havana reaching EOL it way need the versions line adjusted to just be "up to 2014.1.2"

    value due to the fact that a corresponding policy rule is

    enforced only in the case when an attribute is present in the

    target AND has a non-default value.

Added a new attribute "attributes\_to\_update" which contains a list

    of all to-be updated attributes to the body of the target that is

    passed to policy.enforce.

Changed a check for whether an attribute is explicitly set.

    Now, in the case of update, the function should not pay attention

    to a default value of an attribute, but check whether it was

    explicitly marked as being updated.

Added unit-tests.

As far as I understand <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/StableBranch#Releases>, Havana will reach EOL on October, 16. Does it mean that backporting the fix to stable/havana does not make sense?

Elena, that document actually says "OpenStack Havana stable release will reach EOL at Juno (N+2) milestone-3" which according to <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Juno_Release_Schedule> (and subsequent reality) was several weeks ago. It was effectively extended to a week from this past Tuesday when the final 2013.2.4 stable point release was announced to account for any possible release-related accidents, but I'm planning to delete the branch as early as this coming Tuesday, September 30.

Big Switch: Switch to TLSv1 in server manager

Switch to TLSv1 for the connections to the backend

    controllers. The default SSLv3 is no longer considered

    secure.

TLSv1 was chosen over .1 or .2 because the .1 and .2 weren't

    added until python 2.7.9 so TLSv1 is the only compatible option

    for py26.

More interestingly, it uses excutils.save\_and\_reraise\_exception

Schema enhancement to support MultiSegment Network
Description:
Currently, there is nothing in the schema that ensures segments
for a network are returned in the same order they were specified
when the network was created, or even in a deterministic order.
Solution:
We need to add another field named 'segment\_index' in
'ml2\_network\_segment' table containing a numeric position index.
With segment\_index field we can retrieve the segments in the
order in which user created.
This patch set also fixes ML2 invalid unit test case in
test\_create\_network\_multiprovider().

Remove redundant initialization and check from DVR RPC mixin
The initialization, as well as the recurrent checks on whether the agent
is able to handle DVR requests, are not necessary; this is because the

Improve performance of security group DB query
The \_select\_ips\_for\_remote\_group method was joining the
IP allocation, port, allowed address pair, and security group tables
together in a single query. Additionally, it was loading all of
the port columns and using none of them. This resulted in a
very expensive query with no benefit.
This patch eliminates the unnecessary use of the port table by joining
the IP allocation table directly to the security groups and allowed
address pairs tables. In local testing of the method, this sped it up
by an order of magnitude.

Fix KeyError in dhcp\_rpc when plugin.port\_update raise exception
KeyError exception is seen because of following reasons
\* DhcpRpcCallback.\_port\_action() is called by two functions
- DhcpRpcCallback.create\_dchp\_port()
- DhcpRpcCallback.update\_dhcp\_port()
\* When create\_dhcp\_port() function calls \_port\_action(), the
function argument 'port' will have the body as
{'port': {'network\_id': foo\_network\_id, 'fixed\_ips': [..] ...}
\* When update\_dhcp\_port() function calls \_port\_action(), the
function argument 'port' will have the body as
{'id': port\_id, 'port': {{'port': {'network\_id': foo\_network\_id,
'fixed\_ips': [..] ...}}
\* If an exception occurs when \_port\_action() calls plugin.create\_port(),
network id is accessed as
net\_id = port['port']['network\_id']
\* If an exception occurs when \_port\_action() calls plugin.update\_port(),
network id is accessed as
net\_id = port['port']['network\_id']
which is causing the KeyError. network\_id should have been accessed as
net\_id = port['port']['port']['network\_id']
This patch fixes the issue by making the \_port\_action() take the
same port body. update\_dhcp\_port() insteading of passing the port\_id
and port information in a single argument, it now adds port\_id
in the port body itself.

Call DVR VMARP notify outside of transaction
The dvr vmarp table update notification was being called inside
of the delete\_port transaction in ML2, which can cause a yield
and lead to the glorious mysql/eventlet deadlock.

use an existing port dictionary rather than re-looking it up since
the port is now gone from the DB by the time it is called.

Race for l2pop when ports go up/down on same host
With l2pop enabled, race exists in delete\_port\_postcommit
when both create/update\_port and delete\_port deal with
different ports on the same host, where such ports are
either the first (or) last on same network for that host.
This race happens outside the DB locking zones in
the respective methods of ML2 plugin.
To fix this, we have moved determination of
fdb\_entries back to delete\_port\_postcommit and removed
delete\_port\_precommit altogether from l2pop mechanism
driver. In order to accomodate dvr interfaces, we
are storing and re-using the mechanism-driver context
which hold dvr-port-binding information while
invoking delete\_port\_postcommit. We loop through
dvr interface bindings invoking delete\_port\_postcommit
similar to delete\_port\_precommit.

Use EUI64 for IPv6 SLAAC when subnet is specified
This commit uses EUI64 for SLAAC and stateless IPv6 address
when subnet id in fixed\_ip is specified.
After this patch, all the ports created on a subnet which has
ipv6\_address\_mod=slaac or ipv6\_address\_mod=dhcpv6-stateless
will use EUI64 as the address.
This patch also checks if fixed IP address is specified
for a IPv6 subnet with address mode slaac or dhcpv6-stateless
during creating or updating a port. If yes, raise InvalidInput
error to stop the port creation or update.
Remove unit test test\_generated\_duplicate\_ip\_ipv6 because
fixed\_ip should not be specified for a slaac subnet.

- Renamed self to cls in @classmethods
(cisco/db/l3/device\_handling\_db.py)
- Removed whitespace around '=' in a kwarg
(cisco/db/l3/device\_handling\_db.py, cisco/db/n1kv\_db\_v2.py)
- Updated deprecated pylint 'disable-msg' directive to newer 'disable'
(cisco/extensions/qos.py)
- File-specific disable for too-many-format-args pending further
investigation of alternatives
(ml2/drivers/arista/arista\_l3\_driver.py)
- Import module rather than object and avoid long line

marked for removal in Kilo.
Now that Kilo opened, we can drop the deprecated one.

Avoid constructing a RouterInfo object to get namespace name
Constructing a RouterInfo object just for a string concatenation is

Refactor \_process\_routers to handle a single router
The method \_process\_routers no longer handles multiple routers. The
only caller of this method would construct a list of exactly one
router in order to make the call. This made the for loop unnecessary.
The method's logic is too heavy for its current purpose. This commit
removes much of the weight.
The use of the sets in this method is also no longer necessary. It
became clear that all of it boiled down to "if the router is not
compatible with with this agent but it is known in router\_info from
before then we need to remove it." This is an exceptional condition
that shouldn't be handled in this method so I raise an exception and
handle it in process\_router\_update where other router removal is
handled. Logging was added for this exceptional condition.
The eventlet pool was also obsolete. It was used to spawn two methods
and there was a waitall at the end. The other refactoring made it
clear that the two spawns were mutually exclusive. There was only one
thread spawned for any given invocation of the method and the eventlet
pool is overkill.

Disable PUT for IPv6 subnet attributes
In Juno we are not ready for allowing the IPv6 attributes on a subnet
to be updated after the subnet is created, because:
- The implementation for supporting updates is incomplete.
- Perceived lack of usefulness, no good use cases known yet.
- Allowing updates causes more complexity in the code.
- Have not tested that radvd, dhcp, etc. behave OK after update.
Therefore, for now, we set 'allow\_put' to False for the two IPv6
attributes, ipv6\_ra\_mode and ipv6\_address\_mode. This prevents the
modes from being updated via the PUT:subnets API.

Big Switch: Don't clear hash before sync
This patch removes the step of clearing the consistency
hash from the DB before a topology sync. This will ensure
that inconsistency will be detected if the topology sync
fails.
This logic was originally there to make sure the hash header
was not present on the topology sync call to the backend.
However, the hash header is ignored by the backend in a sync
call so it wasn't necessary.

Currently the l3 agent has 2 places where it allows generating ns\_name

RouterInfo's namespace. A simpler fix was also made for snat\_ns\_name.

L3 agent should always use a unique CONF object
The l3 agent accepts an oslo configuration in its constructor and uses
it throughout the code, but there are some references to the global
configuration object held by the oslo library. Since HA functional
tests need to create two agents, the configuration should be consistent
throughout the code.
The important difference between the agents is their 'host' value so
that they create different namespaces, and 'state\_path' value so the
agents get their own filesystem root.

Iterate over same port\_id if more than one exists
In certain cases where multiple ports can have the same
external\_ids:iface\_id property, the ovs agent will arbitrarily choose
one and ignore the rest. In case the chosen port isn't on the
integration bridge the ovs agent is managing, an error is returned to
the calling function. This is faulty since one of the other ports may
belong to the correct bridge and it should be chosen instead.
This is interesting for future L3 HA integration tests, where 2
different instances of l3 agents are needed to run on the same machine.
In this case, both agents will register ports which have the same
iface\_id property, but obviously only one of the ports is relevant for
each agent.

Don't fail when trying to unbind a router
If a router is already unbound from an l3 agent, don't fail. Log
the condition and go on. This is harmless since it can happen
due to a delete race condition between multiple neutron-server
processes. One delete request can determine that it needs to
unbind the router. A second process may also determine that it
needs to unbind the router. The exception thrown will result
in a port delete failure and cause nova to mark a deleted instance
as ERROR.

is not configured, a performance impact may be seen because

ML2: move L3 cleanup out of network transaction
Move \_process\_l3\_delete out of the delete\_network
transaction to eliminate the semaphore deadlock that
occurs when it tries to delete the ports associated
with existing floating IPs.
It makes more sense to live outside of the transaction
anyway because the operations it performs cannot be
rolled back only in the database if the L3 plugin makes
external calls for floating IP creation/deletion.
e.g. if delete\_floatingip is successful, it may have
deleted external resources and restoring the DB records
would make things inconsistent.
If a failure to delete the network does occur, any cleanup
done by \_process\_l3\_delete will not be reversed.

Update migration scripts to support DB2
Three of the migration scripts are causing failures with DB2.
- DB2 doesn't support nullable column in primary key
- Hard coded SQL statements which use False/True as Boolean arguments
are not compatible with DB2. In DB2, Boolean columns are created as
small integer with a constraint to allow only 0 & 1.
- Hardcoded update rows from other table sql is not compatible with DB2
- Foreign key constraints require additional handling

Do not assume order of report list elements
This fixes the test\_report\_multiple\_services unit test that breaks with a
randomized PYTHONHASHSEED (see the bug report).
The test assumed that the report list from self.driver.report\_status() had
elements in a particular order. Found with PYTHONHASHSEED=2455351445.
The fix refactors the test case to handle an unsorted report list by
sorting it before checking equality.

Note: There are several other unrelated unit tests that also break with a
randomized PYTHONHASHSEED, but they are not addressed here. They will be

Revert "Cleanup floatingips also on router delete"
This reverts commit c3326996e38cb67f8d4ba3dabd829dc6f327b666.
The patch being reverted here addresses an issue that can no longer be
reproduced, in that under no circumstances, I can make the FIP lie around
before deleting a router (which can only be done after all FIP have been
disassociated or released).
Unless we have more clarity as to what the initial commit was really meant
to fix, there is a strong case for reverting this patch at this point.

the current validator checks that the value does not exceed sys.maxsize

In SQLite Integer can be stored in 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending
on the magnitude of the value. Nevertheless, assume that it can not
exceed 4 bytes for consistency.

Forbid regular users to reset admin-only attrs to default values
A regular user can reset an admin-only attribute to its default
value due to the fact that a corresponding policy rule is
enforced only in the case when an attribute is present in the
target AND has a non-default value.
Added a new attribute "attributes\_to\_update" which contains a list
of all to-be updated attributes to the body of the target that is
passed to policy.enforce.
Changed a check for whether an attribute is explicitly set.
Now, in the case of update, the function should not pay attention
to a default value of an attribute, but check whether it was
explicitly marked as being updated.
Added unit-tests.

Rework and enable VPNaaS UT for Cisco CSR REST
The Cisco CSR REST client library unit tests were developed in
Icehouse, using the httmock library. However, the community did
not want to add this library to global requirements, as there was
a similar httpretty library available (albeit with some short-
comings). As a result, the test module was renamed with a "no"
prefix, to prevent inclusion in automated tests.
Since then, a new library, requests-mock, has been added to global
requirements, to replace httpretty, and is being used on several
other projects.
This commit reworks the unit test to use requests-mock, instead of
httmock. The functionality is the same, but the mechanism (a
fixture with URI registration vs context manager) is different.
This commit provides coverage for the REST client code, by using a
mock for the Cisco CSR VM. The unit test module can be subclassed,
and used with a real CSR VM, for 3rd party CI testing, in the
future.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1134612#c0)  dontu    2014-08-27 23:25:02 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Today if we modify the n1kv VSM credential in the cisco_plugins.ini, the older VSM ip address remains in the db, and all requests are sent to the older VSM. This patch deletes all n1kv VSM credentials on neutron start up before adding the newer VSM credentials. Hence making sure that there is only one n1kv VSM IP address and credential in the db.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1134612#c2)  dontu    2014-08-28 22:20:19 UTC  ``` Merged into Juno master on 7/25   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1134612#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-11-03 08:38:52 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

By updating a network attribute with a default value a non-privileged user may reset admin-only network attributes. This may lead to unexpected behavior with security implications for operators with a custom policy.json, or in some extreme cases network outages resulting in denial of service.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1686)

## Topic

Updated openstack-neutron packages that fix one security issue and several
bugs are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

OpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven
system that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main
function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red
Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'
as the core component of OpenStack Networking.

It was discovered that unprivileged users could in some cases reset
admin-only network attributes to their default values. This could lead to
unexpected behavior or in some cases result in a denial of service.
(CVE-2014-6414)

These updated packages also fix various bugs. Documentation for these bug
fixes is available in the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

All openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
