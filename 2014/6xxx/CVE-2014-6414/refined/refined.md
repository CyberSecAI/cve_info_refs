Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how OpenStack Neutron enforces policy rules for network attributes. Specifically, when a non-admin user attempts to modify an admin-only attribute by setting it to its default value, the policy check is bypassed. This happens because the policy engine only verifies if an attribute is present and has a non-default value; if the attribute is set to the default, it's not considered an explicit change and the policy is not enforced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper enforcement of access control policies. Non-privileged users can modify admin-only network attributes.
*   **Policy Bypass:** The mechanism for detecting attribute changes allows a specific type of modification (setting to default) to bypass security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Exploiting this vulnerability may lead to unpredictable behavior in the network infrastructure.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** In extreme cases, it could cause network outages, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Security Implications:** Operators who have custom `policy.json` files may experience security issues or unexpected behaviours due to the unauthorized changes to network attributes.
*   **Potential Disruption:**  Users could potentially restore settings (e.g SNAT) that were intentionally disabled by the administrator. Also, they could un-distribute a distributed router, effectively making it non-functional.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited via API calls to modify network attributes, as described in the Launchpad bug report.
*   A non-privileged user can make these API calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker must be an authenticated user within the OpenStack environment, but does not need to have administrative privileges.
*   **API Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the Neutron API and know how to modify network attributes.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects OpenStack Neutron up to versions 2013.2.4 and 2014.1.2
*   The fix involves modifying the policy enforcement mechanism to check if an attribute is explicitly marked as being updated, regardless of its value being the default or not.
*   Red Hat has addressed this issue in RHSA-2014:1686, RHSA-2014:1785 and RHSA-2014:1786.
*   The OpenStack bug report also indicates that this is not a new issue; it is a behavior that has always been present in the system, therefore this vulnerability affects a wide range of deployments.
