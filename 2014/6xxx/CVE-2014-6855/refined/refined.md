Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in VU#582497, which is related to CVE-2014-6855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means that these applications do not verify if the certificate presented by a server is signed by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The core weakness lies in the inadequate implementation of SSL/TLS certificate validation within the Android applications.
*   **Missing Chain of Trust Verification:** The applications do not verify the complete chain of trust to ensure the certificate provided by the server was issued by a trusted CA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should have been encrypted by HTTPS.
*   **Credential Stealing:**  Attackers can potentially steal user credentials transmitted via these vulnerable apps.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Depending on the application's functionality, the impact can range from data modification to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based MITM:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's Android device. This can include public Wi-Fi or compromised networks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the vulnerable Android device and the server it is communicating with.
*   **Ability to Forge Certificates:** The attacker will need to be able to generate or manipulate certificates to be accepted by vulnerable applications.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
*   The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of the server certificate on SSL/TLS.
*   The document references tools like CERT Tapioca used for discovering these flaws
*   A spreadsheet is maintained to track affected applications and the availability of fixes.

This analysis provides more details than a typical CVE description, outlining the technical specifics of the vulnerability, its impact, the attack vector, and the conditions needed for a successful exploit.
