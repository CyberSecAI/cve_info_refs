Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-6230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WP-Ban plugin, prior to version 1.6.4, used the `X-Forwarded-For` header to determine the client's IP address if it was present. This header is easily spoofed by malicious actors, allowing them to bypass IP-based blocking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IP Address Spoofing:** The plugin's reliance on the `X-Forwarded-For` header without proper validation or sanitization makes it susceptible to IP spoofing.
- **Lack of Warning:** The plugin doesn't warn administrators that the IP blocking mechanism might not work correctly with all web server configurations, specifically when `X-Forwarded-For` headers aren't properly handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass IP Blacklist:** Attackers could bypass the plugin's IP-based blocking mechanism, gaining access to the site despite being on the blacklist.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Injection:** The attack is performed by injecting a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header into the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **Header Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header of their requests.

**Additional Information:**
- **CVSS:** The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS base score of 5 (Medium), with a vector of `AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N`.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.4 of the WP-Ban plugin, where a setting was added to check for reverse proxy usage. If a reverse proxy is being used, it will check the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header to get the correct IP address.
- **Affected Plugin:** The vulnerability is specific to the WP-Ban WordPress plugin.
- **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to bypass the IP blacklist using `curl` with a modified `X-Forwarded-For` header.
