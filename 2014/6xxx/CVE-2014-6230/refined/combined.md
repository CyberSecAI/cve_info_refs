Probably one of those ban plugins that don’t work if you do not have the exact default wordpress login.
Bummer..

I have been searching for a tool to get rid of robot users and their advertising comments at my site’s comment section. This extension worked. It successfully blocked 48 entry from 8 different ip adress within one day.
Thanks for providing it

For whatever reasons, I cannot get this plugin to work. I’ve tried banning both an entire IP range, as well as each IP within that range and I am still receiving visitor reports stating that my site is receiving visitors from that range.

Not sure if this actually works, but it slowed my admin operations to a very annoying speed. I would rather de-install this one. Sorry

# Vulnerability in WP-Ban allows visitors to bypass the IP blacklist in some configurations (WordPress plugin)

---

*From*: dxw Security <security () dxw com>

*Date*: Wed, 17 Sep 2014 13:59:56 +0000

---

```
Details
================
Software: WP-Ban
Version: 1.62
Homepage: <http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-ban/>
Advisory report:
<https://security.dxw.com/advisories/vulnerability-in-wp-ban-allows-visitors-to-bypass-the-ip-blacklist-in-some-configurations/>
CVE: CVE-2014-6230
CVSS: 5 (Medium; AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)

Description
================
Vulnerability in WP-Ban allows visitors to bypass the IP blacklist in some configurations

Vulnerability
================
This plugin allows blacklisting users based on their IP address, however it takes the IP address from the
X-Forwarded-For header if available.
Not all Web server configurations will strip or replace X-Forwarded-For headers – in which case the IP ban can be
bypassed by sending this header. This plugin therefore only works in certain configurations, but does not warn admins
of this fact.

Proof of concept
================

Visit <http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=wp-ban/ban-options.php>
Set “Banned IPs” to “127.0.0.1″
Execute “curl [http://localhost/\"](http://localhost/%5C%22); and see the “You Are Banned” message
Execute “curl <http://localhost/> -H \'X-Forwarded-For: 999.999.999.999\'\" and see that it displays the page

Note that this will not work if your Web server sets or strips X-Forwarded-For headers.
(To remove the IP blacklist run this SQL: “delete from wp_options where option_name=\'banned_ips\';\")

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 1.6.4 or later.
If a reverse-proxy is used, check the “I am using a reverse proxy” box in the plugin settings, and ensure that
X-Forwarded-For headers are being set even if the request already contains an X-Forwarded-For header.

Disclosure policy
================
dxw believes in responsible disclosure. Your attention is drawn to our disclosure policy:
<https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/>

Please contact us on security () dxw com to acknowledge this report if you received it via a third party (for example,
plugins () wordpress org) as they generally cannot communicate with us on your behalf.

This vulnerability will be published if we do not receive a response to this report with 14 days.
