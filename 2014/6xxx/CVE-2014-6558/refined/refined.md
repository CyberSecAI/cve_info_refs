Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6558:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect exception handling within the `CipherInputStream` class implementation in OpenJDK.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in how `CipherInputStream` handles exceptions during the processing of encrypted streams. This improper handling could allow an attacker to manipulate the stream and compromise its integrity. This is a flaw in the Security component of OpenJDK.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could lead to a compromise of the integrity of an encrypted stream, meaning the attacker could potentially modify the contents of the stream without detection. This may lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker is able to influence the contents of the stream to point to malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, meaning a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability.  This vulnerability is related to processing of encrypted streams, so any application that uses the affected class to handle encrypted data is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to send a crafted stream that would trigger the improper exception handling logic in the vulnerable `CipherInputStream` class.

**Summary of Findings:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `CipherInputStream` class implementation within OpenJDK and IBM SDK which results in incorrect exception handling.
*   A remote attacker can potentially affect the integrity of an encrypted stream.
*   The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of OpenJDK and IBM SDK.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network.
*   Successful exploitation has a low impact on availability and confidentiality, but a partial impact on integrity of the affected system.
