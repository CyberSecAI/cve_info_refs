  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates during SSL/TLS communication.",
      "Failure to validate the SSL chain against trusted root certificate authorities (CAs)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic meant to be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",

        "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.",

      "Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.",
        "Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device."
