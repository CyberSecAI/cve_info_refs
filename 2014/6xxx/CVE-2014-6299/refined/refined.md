The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6299.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The mm_forum TYPO3 extension did not properly sanitize user-supplied input and lacked file type checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization of user input.
- Arbitrary Code Execution due to the ability to upload arbitrary files (including PHP files) without proper validation against a deny list.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) that allowed for the creation of posts on behalf of logged-in users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- XSS: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading malicious PHP files, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- CSRF: An attacker could create forum posts on behalf of logged-in users without their consent, potentially leading to reputation damage or other unwanted actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- XSS: By injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied input fields (e.g., forum posts).
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By uploading malicious PHP files.
- CSRF: By crafting malicious requests that could be unknowingly triggered by logged-in users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- XSS: An attacker would need to be able to inject scripts through user input mechanisms in the forum.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker would need the ability to upload files to the server through the forum's file upload feature.
- CSRF: An attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request.

**Additional details:**
The advisory also notes that the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.9.3. The advisory includes a CVSS vector string that indicates a high severity with a score of 8.6
