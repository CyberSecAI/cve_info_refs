### Vulnerability Summary:
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, potentially allowing an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### Root Cause:
The applications do not properly validate the SSL chain to ensure that the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

### Weakness:
Improper SSL certificate validation.

### Impact:
An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.

### Attack Vector:
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### Required Capabilities:
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
