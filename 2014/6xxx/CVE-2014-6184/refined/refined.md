Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6184:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) client. It is caused by insufficient validation of command line argument lengths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The program does not properly check the size of user-provided input (command-line arguments), leading to a buffer overflow on the stack when processing arguments that exceed the allocated space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user providing crafted command-line arguments to the TSM client.
*   The specific executable vulnerable is dsmtca (Trusted Communications Agent).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a local user on a system running a vulnerable version of the TSM client.
*   The attacker must have the ability to execute the dsmtca program.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   TSM Client 6.3.0.0 through 6.3.2.2
*   TSM Client 6.2.0.0 through 6.2.5.3
*   TSM Client 6.1.0.0 through 6.1.5.6
*   TSM Client 5.5.0.0 through 5.5.4.3
*   TSM Client 5.4.0.0 through 5.4.3.6
*   Affected platforms include AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Mac.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary fix involves upgrading to a version of the TSM client that includes the fix.
*   A workaround is to change the permissions on the `dsmtca` executable so that only trusted users are allowed to execute it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Matthias Kaiser from Daimler TSS GmbH.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.2.
*   The fix involves adding validation of command-line argument lengths to prevent the buffer overflow.
