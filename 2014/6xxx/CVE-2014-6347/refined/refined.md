- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption that could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. This could lead to complete system control if the user has administrative rights, enabling the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website. An attacker could host this website and convince a user to view it. They could also leverage compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject content into a website and convince a user to view it using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
