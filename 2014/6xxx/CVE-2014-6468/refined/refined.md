  "CVE-2014-6468": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Hotspot component in OpenJDK failed to properly handle malformed Shared Archive files.",
    "details": "The Hotspot component in OpenJDK failed to properly check the format of a loaded SharedArchiveFile.  If a JVM was instructed to load untrusted SharedArchiveFile, it could cause JVM to execute arbitrary code. An attacker able to modify a Shared Archive file used by a virtual machine of a different user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their privileges. OpenJDK versions 6 and 7 only load shared archive that is distributed with JDK and the file path is hard-coded in JVM.  OpenJDK 8 allows alternate shared archive file name to be specified using the -XX:SharedArchiveFile= command line option.",
    "vulnerability": "Insufficient validation of Shared Archive files leading to arbitrary code execution.",
     "impact": "A local attacker could potentially escalate their privileges by modifying a shared archive file used by a different user's virtual machine.",
     "attack_vector": "Local access to the system with the ability to modify Shared Archive files.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to modify shared archive files used by other users."
