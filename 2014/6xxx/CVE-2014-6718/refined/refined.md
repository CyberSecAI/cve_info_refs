  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificate on SSL/TLS connections."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable device."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device."

     "affected_applications": "The vulnerability affects multiple Android applications. A spreadsheet is provided that contains a list of applications that failed SSL validation testing.",
     "testing_methodology": "The CERT Tapioca tool was used to test the applications.",
    "solution": "Apply application updates that properly validate SSL certificates. Workarounds include not using affected applications and avoiding untrusted networks."
