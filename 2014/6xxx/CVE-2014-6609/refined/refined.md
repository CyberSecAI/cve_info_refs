- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The crash occurs because Asterisk allocates data of one type at one layer and then interprets the data as a separate type at a different layer when processing a SIP SUBSCRIBE request with unexpected mixes of headers for a given event package. This type confusion leads to a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Type confusion due to the lack of type-safety in the pubsub API.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trigger a crash in Asterisk, leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed SIP SUBSCRIBE request with unexpected header combinations to a configured endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a configured endpoint and must pass any authentication configured on the Asterisk server.
