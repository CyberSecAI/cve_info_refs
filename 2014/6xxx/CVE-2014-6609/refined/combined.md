| **CVE Name** | CVE-2014-6609 |

| **Description** | It is possible to trigger a crash in Asterisk by sending a SIP SUBSCRIBE request with unexpected mixes of headers for a given event package. The crash occurs because Asterisk allocates data of one type at one layer and then interprets the data as a separate type at a different layer. The crash requires that the SUBSCRIBE be sent from a configured endpoint, and the SUBSCRIBE must pass any authentication that has been configured.    Note that this crash is Asterisk's PJSIP-based res\_pjsip\_pubsub module and not in the old chan\_sip module. |

| **Resolution** | Type-safety has been built into the pubsub API where it previously was absent. A test has been added to the testsuite that previously would have triggered the crash. |
