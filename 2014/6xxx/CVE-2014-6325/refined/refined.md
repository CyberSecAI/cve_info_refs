- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Exchange Server does not properly validate input, specifically URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Outlook Web App (OWA).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could run scripts in the context of the current user, potentially allowing them to:
    - Read content the attacker is not authorized to access
    - Use the victim's identity to perform actions on the OWA site (e.g., change permissions, delete content)
    - Inject malicious content into the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Email Attack**: An attacker sends an email with a specially crafted URL to a user of the targeted OWA site, convincing them to click the link.
    - **Web-based attack**: An attacker hosts a website with a specially crafted URL, or uses compromised websites or websites with user-provided content to host the malicious URL.  The attacker must convince the user to visit the attacker's site and then click the specially crafted link to the OWA site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send email or host a website that users can access.
    - The attacker must convince the user to click a specially crafted link.
    - The targeted user must be using an affected version of Outlook Web App.
