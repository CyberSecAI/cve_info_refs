Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-6255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The login form of the Zenoss Core application accepts an arbitrary URL in the `came_from` query parameter. After a successful login, the application redirects the user to the URL specified in this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Open Redirect: The application fails to validate or sanitize the URL provided in the `came_from` parameter, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary external URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can craft a malicious link that appears to lead to the legitimate Zenoss application, but redirects the user to a page controlled by the attacker. This can be used for phishing attacks, where the attacker could steal user credentials or infect the user's system with malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a URL with a malicious value for the `came_from` query parameter and tricking a user into clicking on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious redirect and convince a user to click on this link. No special privileges or access to the Zenoss server is required.

**Additional Notes:**
The vulnerability has been resolved in Zenoss Core 4.2.5 SP161.
