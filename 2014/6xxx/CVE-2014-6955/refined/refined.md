The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6955.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL/TLS server certificate chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can be performed.
- An attacker can potentially view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, typically via a MITM attack on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
