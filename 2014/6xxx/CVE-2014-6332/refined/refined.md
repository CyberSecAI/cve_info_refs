  "CVE-2014-6332": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in how the `SafeArrayRedim` function in OleAut32.dll handles array resizing in VBScript. When an error occurs during resizing, the function doesn't reset the array size, leading to a discrepancy between the actual and reported array sizes. This allows memory corruption by manipulating array elements outside the intended bounds.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper bounds checking in the SafeArrayRedim function within the OleAut32.dll library, which is used by VBScript to manage arrays. Specifically, when a resizing operation fails, the function does not reset the array size before returning, allowing subsequent operations to access memory beyond the intended boundaries.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) by manipulating memory and bypassing security mechanisms like Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) in Internet Explorer and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). This can lead to complete system compromise.",
      "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted web page that exploits the vulnerability via VBScript in Internet Explorer. The attacker can also achieve the same by embedding the malicious VBScript in other applications that use OleAut32.dll.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious web page or open a malicious document that contains the exploit. The attacker must also be able to host the malicious page or send the malicious file."
    },
    {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from improper memory access in the OleAut32 library when used in conjunction with VBScript. Specifically, the 'redim preserve' command can lead to incorrect handling of array sizes if an error occurs during the process.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is present in the `SafeArrayRedim` function within `OleAut32.dll`. It is triggered when VBScript attempts to resize an array using the `redim preserve` command, and an error occurs in `SafeArrayRedim`, but the array size is not reset correctly before returning to the calling function. This condition leads to out-of-bounds memory access.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE), gaining the same user rights as the current user, with the potential for complete system compromise if the user is an administrator. It can also bypass Internet Explorer's Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) sandbox and Microsoft's EMET tool.",
      "Attack vectors": "Exploitation is possible through a malicious web page viewed via Internet Explorer or other software using the vulnerable OleAut32 library and/or VBScript. This includes techniques like using drive-by downloads from a compromised webpage or convincing a user to open a malicious HTA (HTML Application) file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or send a malicious HTA to a targeted user. User interaction (e.g., visiting the website or opening the HTA) is needed."
    },
      {
       "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to improper memory handling within the OleAut32 library during array resizing operations, specifically when using `SafeArrayRedim` with VBScript's `redim preserve`. The issue occurs when the size of the array is not correctly reset after a failed resizing, leading to incorrect memory access during later array operations.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"The vulnerability is present in how the `SafeArrayRedim` function in the `OleAut32.dll` library handles array resizing. When an error occurs during the `redim preserve` operation in VBScript, the size is not reset, leading to a memory corruption condition.",
        "Impact of exploitation":"The vulnerability leads to remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can use this to manipulate memory and bypass security mechanisms like Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) in Internet Explorer and EMET to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.",
        "Attack vectors":"The main attack vector involves enticing a user to visit a specially-crafted webpage in Internet Explorer. Other applications that use `OleAut32.dll` or `VBscript` may also be vulnerable.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position":"An attacker requires a mechanism to persuade the target to interact with malicious content. This may be done by hosting a website or sending malicious HTML files through email."

    },
  {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the `SafeArrayRedim` function within `OleAut32.dll` not properly handling array resizing in certain error conditions when called from VBScript. When an error occurs, the size of the array is not reset properly.",
     "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper memory management in the `SafeArrayRedim` function of `OleAut32.dll`, used during VBScript array resizing with `redim preserve`. The function fails to reset the array size upon encountering an error, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "The attacker can achieve remote code execution by manipulating memory and bypassing protections such as Internet Explorer's Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) and EMET, leading to complete system compromise.",
     "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted webpage viewed in Internet Explorer using VBScript can exploit this vulnerability, as well as other applications leveraging OleAut32.dll or VBscript.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must host a malicious web page or send a malicious file, and induce the target user to access it through Internet Explorer, or an application using the vulnerability libraries."
    },
   {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from an issue within the OleAut32.dll library's SafeArrayRedim function. When this function is called via VBScript's redim preserve, there's a code path where, if an error happens, the array size is not correctly reset. This leaves the system open for memory manipulation.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present":"The vulnerability exists because the SafeArrayRedim function does not properly handle errors when resizing SafeArrays. In VBScript, when using the 'redim preserve' statement, if SafeArrayRedim returns an error, the old array size is not reset before returning to the calling function. This allows memory corruption by writing outside of bounds.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). By manipulating memory, the attacker could bypass the Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) sandbox in Internet Explorer and the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET). This could lead to a complete system compromise.",
      "Attack vectors":"The most likely exploitation vector is through a malicious web page containing VBScript opened by Internet Explorer, as it contains VBScript.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must convince the user to browse a malicious website via Internet Explorer or open a malicious file containing embedded scripting that leverages the vulnerability."
