The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6649.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means they do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify server certificates on SSL/TLS connections.
- Use of vulnerable libraries in some applications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Ability to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, depending on application functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Untrusted networks, including public WiFi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- Position on the same network as the victim device is sufficient.
