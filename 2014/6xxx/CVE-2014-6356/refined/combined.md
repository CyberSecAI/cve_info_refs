## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office Web Apps Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3017301)

Published: December 9, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office Web Apps. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker convinces a user to open or preview a specially crafted Microsoft Word file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft Word 2013, Microsoft Word 2013 RT, Microsoft Office for Mac 2011, Microsoft Word Viewer, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, and for affected Microsoft Office services and Web Apps on supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, and Microsoft Office Web Apps Server 2013. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how Microsoft Word parses specially crafted Office files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Vulnerability Information** section for the specific vulnerability.

For more information about this update, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3017301](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3017301).

## Vulnerability Information

## Invalid Index Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2014-6356

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in how Microsoft Word improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. System memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Systems where affected Microsoft Word software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a file that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

This update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Word parses specially crafted files. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a file that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.
