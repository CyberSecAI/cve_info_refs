The content is related to CVE-2014-6356.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Word improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. Specifically, system memory can be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
An invalid index vulnerability exists due to improper handling of objects in memory, leading to memory corruption. This allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing, changing, or deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
Attack vectors include:
1.  **Email:** Sending a specially crafted file to the user and convincing them to open it in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.
2.  **Web-based:** Hosting a website containing a malicious file, or hosting the file on a compromised website or a website that allows user-provided content, and then convincing the victim to visit the site and open the file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to:
1.  Create a specially crafted Microsoft Word file.
2.  Convince the victim to open the file using an affected version of Microsoft Office software, either through email or by luring them to a malicious website.
