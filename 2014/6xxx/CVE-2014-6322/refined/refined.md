Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-6322:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by the Microsoft Windows Audio service improperly validating permissions under specific conditions. This improper validation can allow a script to be run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper permission validation in the Windows Audio service component.
- Potential for privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to elevate privileges on an affected system.
- While the vulnerability itself doesn't allow arbitrary code execution, it can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability to run code with higher privileges.
- For instance, if a remote code execution vulnerability is used to execute code with low integrity, this vulnerability could allow that code to run with medium integrity (user level permissions), effectively escalating privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could host a website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content could also be used to deliver an exploit.
- The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the malicious website or interact with the malicious content to initiate the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to run code on the target system with at least low-integrity level permissions.
- To reach the low-integrity level, the attacker needs to exploit another vulnerability in a component like Internet Explorer to run code on the victimâ€™s system.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince the victim to interact with their malicious content.
- The attacker does not need remote code execution to exploit this vulnerability, but a method of code execution with limited privileges is required in order to leverage the vulnerability and elevate privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed by adding extra permission validations to the Windows Audio service.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Windows versions, including Windows Vista, Server 2008, 7, Server 2008 R2, 8, 8.1, Server 2012, Server 2012 R2, RT, and RT 8.1.
- Microsoft was not aware of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild at the time of the bulletin release.
- The severity rating is "Important," and the maximum security impact is "Elevation of Privilege."
- The vulnerability requires a separate vulnerability to initially execute code on the system before the elevation of privilege is possible.
