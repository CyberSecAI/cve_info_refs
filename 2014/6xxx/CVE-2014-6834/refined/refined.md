  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections.",

      "Improper SSL certificate validation.",
      "Failure to verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, allowing them to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",

      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.",
      "Exploitation of vulnerable applications communicating over HTTPS."
