The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6990.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper SSL certificate validation. The applications do not verify that the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.

**Attack vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
