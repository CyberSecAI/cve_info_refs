Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6457:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the TLS/SSL implementation within the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) component of OpenJDK.
*   The root cause is an insufficient check of the server's identity during renegotiation following session resumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper server identity verification during TLS/SSL renegotiation after session resumption.
*   Failure to adequately protect against the Triple Handshake attack during renegotiation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   A malicious server could potentially manipulate the authenticated session of a client with a different server.
*   This manipulation is possible if the client uses client certificate authentication with the vulnerable JSSE implementation.
*   An attacker could affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the system using this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A malicious TLS/SSL server is needed.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during the renegotiation process following a session resumption.
*   The client must use client certificate authentication.
*   The attack can be performed remotely over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker needs to control a malicious TLS/SSL server.
*   Attacker needs to be in a position to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack and manipulate the TLS/SSL renegotiation.

**Additional notes:**
*   This vulnerability was addressed in Oracle Java SE 5.0u75, 6u85, 7u71, and 8u25.
*   The issue was fixed in IcedTea6 1.13.5 and IcedTea7 2.5.3.
*   The upstream OpenJDK commit is: `http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u/jdk/rev/8b0fbfddc048`
*   The IBM SDK disables the SSL 3.0 protocol to address CVE-2014-3566
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security.
*  Several advisories were published to address the vulnerability in different products.
