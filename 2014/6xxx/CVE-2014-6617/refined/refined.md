  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain root access to the device, allowing them to copy or alter configuration data, and modify other device parameters.",
  "Attack vectors": "Remote access via the telnet protocol.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the device."
