Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-6361:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Excel improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. This improper handling leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The core weakness is an invalid pointer issue that occurs when parsing specially crafted Office files in Microsoft Excel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system.
- This control could be used to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer rights would be less impacted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attack:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file to a user, and convinces the user to open it.
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a website containing a malicious Excel file. The attacker would need to convince the user to visit the website, typically through a link in an email or instant message. Compromised websites or those accepting user content could also host such files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted Excel file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file.
- The attacker does not need any specific position in the network, but the user must have access to the attackerâ€™s file.
