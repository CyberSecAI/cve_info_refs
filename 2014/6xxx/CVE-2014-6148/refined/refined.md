Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-6148

**Vulnerability Description:**
IBM Tivoli Application Dependency Discovery Manager (TADDM) has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to steal sensitive information required to access the TADDM database.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that there is a flaw in how TADDM handles access or authentication to the database, allowing unauthorized access through information leakage. Additionally, the related bulletin mentions a vulnerability in the BIRT-Report Viewer application, suggesting this component may be involved in the information exposure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive information disclosure leading to unauthorized database access.
- Potential for unauthorized access to the TADDM database.
- Vulnerability in BIRT-Report Viewer application (referenced in the related bulletin).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the TADDM database.
- Sensitive data within the TADDM database can be stolen.
- Potential for further malicious activities within the compromised TADDM environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it is likely a network-based attack targeting TADDM.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to bypass authentication or gain access to internal database details, potentially through the BIRT-Report Viewer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker likely needs network access to the TADDM environment.
- It is likely the attacker needs some knowledge of TADDM to leverage the vulnerability, although this is not explicitly stated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects TADDM versions 7.2.2.0 through 7.2.2.2.
- A specific eFix is available for each affected release of TADDM.
- As a workaround, disabling the BIRT-Report Viewer application is recommended.
