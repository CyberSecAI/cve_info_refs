## Error description

* ```
  If a user account is hijacked, the hijacker has access to
  the My Account menu which allows a password change.  The
  password change screen requires the old password, but does not
  honor the ConsecFailedAttempts setting from the ui.properties
  file, so it can be tried an infinite number of times.

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  If a user account is hijacked, either from an idle workstation
  or through a session-stealing attack method, and the Change
  Password screen opens on the Login page, either due to
  password expiration or first time user login as required by a
  password policy that has been put in place, the hijacker can
  try the existing password field, using trial and error, an
  infinite number of times.  The system does not honor the value
  set for the ConsecFailedAttempts parameter in the ui.properties
  file and does mot lock the user upon reaching the limit of
  failed logins.
