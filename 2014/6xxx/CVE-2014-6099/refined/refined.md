Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-6099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the failure of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator to enforce the `ConsecFailedAttempts` setting (defined in the `ui.properties` file) on the "Change Password" screens. This setting is designed to limit the number of failed login attempts before a user account is locked out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Brute-force vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the ability for an attacker to make an unlimited number of password attempts without triggering account lockout.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The `ConsecFailedAttempts` setting was not being honored on the "My Account > Change Password" screen (IT03935) and also when the "Change Password" screen appears due to password expiration or first-time user login (IT03936).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account takeover:** If a user account is hijacked (e.g., through a session-stealing attack or an unattended logged-in workstation), an attacker can try an unlimited number of password combinations to change the password and gain control of the account.
*   **Data breach:** Successful account takeover could lead to the unauthorized access to sensitive data within the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator system, resulting in data breaches and confidentiality violations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Hijacked user sessions:** An attacker could exploit an already authenticated user session (from an idle workstation or a session-stealing attack) to access the "Change Password" screen and attempt to change the password.
*  **Password Expiration / First Time User Login:** An attacker could also exploit the "Change Password" screen that appears on the login page during password expiration or initial login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a hijacked user session:** The attacker needs a hijacked user session or the ability to access a system that requires a password reset.
*   **Knowledge of the target user's username:** The attacker would need to know the username for the account they are trying to compromise.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this issue was delivered in Generic Interim Fix 5020402\_4 for IBM Sterling B2B Integrator 5.2 and Generic Interim Fix 5104\_6 for Sterling Integrator 5.1.
*   The vulnerability is identified by two APARs, IT03935 and IT03936.
