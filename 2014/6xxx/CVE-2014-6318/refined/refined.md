    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-6318",
      "description": "A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) when RDP does not properly log failed logon attempts. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass the audit logon security feature. The security feature bypass by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution. However an attacker could use this bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability.",
      "root_cause": "The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) fails to properly log audit events related to failed logon attempts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper logging of failed logon attempts"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker could bypass the audit logon security feature. This allows an attacker to evade detection of multiple failed logon attempts.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly attempting failed logon attempts via RDP."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to connect to an RDP service, and attempt multiple failed logons.",
        "additional_notes": "This vulnerability can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability for further exploitation, but does not allow arbitrary code execution on its own. Systems with RDP disabled are not at risk."
