Details
==========
Software: ClassApps SelectSurvey.net
Description: Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
Version: 4.124.004
Homepage: <https://www.classapps.com/SelectSurveyNETOverview.asp>
Vendor Fix: 4.125.002
CVE: 2014-6030

Description
==========
SelectSurvey.net is a web-based survey application written in ASP.net
and C#. It is vulnerable to multiple SQL injection attacks, both
authenticated and unauthenticated. The authenticated vulnerability
resides within the file upload script, as the parameters are not
sanitized prior to being placed into the SQL query. ClassApps had
previously listed 'SQL injection protection' as a feature and did have
several functions in place to attempt to prevent such attacks but due to
using a "blacklisting" approach, it is possible to circumvent these
functions. These functions are used elsewhere throughout the application
to protect GET request variables but are not sufficient. Only this
specific version of the application has been tested but it is highly
likely these vulnerabilities exist within prior versions. It has not
been confirmed that these vulnerabilities are fixed. The vendor stated
that they would be fixed in this new release however, they do not allow
download of the code unless you are a customer so fixes have not been
verified.

Examples
==========
/survey/ReviewReadOnlySurvey.aspx?ResponseID=<num>&SurveyID=[SQLi]
(unauthenticated)
/survey/UploadImagePopupToDb.aspx?ResponseID=<num>&SurveyID=[SQLi]
(authenticated)

sqlmap identified the following injection points:

    Type: stacked queries
    Title: Microsoft SQL Server/Sybase stacked queries
