Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-6030

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of input parameters before they are used in SQL queries. The application employs a "blacklisting" approach which can be easily bypassed, instead of sanitizing user-supplied inputs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** Both authenticated and unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the application.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize parameters used in SQL queries. It uses a "blacklisting" approach which can be bypassed.
*   **Vulnerable File Upload Script:** The authenticated SQL injection vulnerability resides in the file upload script specifically.
*   **GET Request Variable Vulnerability:**  The application attempts to protect GET request variables, but the method is not sufficient to prevent SQL injections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or potentially gaining control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `SurveyID` parameter in the `/survey/ReviewReadOnlySurvey.aspx` URL.
*   **Authenticated SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `SurveyID` parameter in the `/survey/UploadImagePopupToDb.aspx` URL.
*   **GET Requests:** The application exposes vulnerabilities in GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Attack:** Requires network access to the application, no prior authentication required for `/survey/ReviewReadOnlySurvey.aspx`
*   **Authenticated Attack:** Requires valid user credentials for the application to access the file upload script, `/survey/UploadImagePopupToDb.aspx`.

**Technical details:**
*   The application is a web-based survey application written in ASP.net and C#.
*   The back-end database is Microsoft SQL Server.
*   The provided SQL injection examples demonstrate boolean-based blind, stacked queries and time-based blind techniques.
