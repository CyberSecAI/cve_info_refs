  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper SSL certificate validation"
    ],

    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
