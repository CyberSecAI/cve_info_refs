The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6004.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper SSL certificate validation. The applications fail to properly verify the SSL chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that is intended to be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution. The specific impact depends on the functionality of the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be on the same network as the Android device. This can be achieved by controlling the network (e.g., public Wi-Fi) or by being on a network that the device is using.
