The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6678.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CA

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can be performed.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic that should be encrypted by HTTPS.
- Potential credential theft and arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploitation occurs during HTTPS communication when the application does not properly validate the server's SSL certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform a MITM attack on the same network.
