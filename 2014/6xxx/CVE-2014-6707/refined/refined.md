- Viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS
- Credential theft
- Arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to a widespread issue found in many Android applications.
- CERT Tapioca was used to test the applications.
- The vulnerability was publicly known as early as 2012, but the CERT advisory was released in 2014, indicating a lag in widespread awareness and mitigation.
- A spreadsheet containing a list of vulnerable applications and their status is mentioned, which is periodically updated.
- The issue affects many applications, with over 23,000 vulnerable out of over 1 million tested apps.
