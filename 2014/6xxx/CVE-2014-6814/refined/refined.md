The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6814.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means they do not verify that the certificate presented by the server is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution, depending on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker on the same network as the Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- Must be on the same network as the victim or able to position themselves between the device and the server (e.g., via a malicious WiFi hotspot).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is widespread across multiple Android applications.
- The content references a spreadsheet that contains information about affected apps, their versions, and available fixes.
- The issue was discovered via dynamic testing of Android applications using a tool named CERT Tapioca.
- The vulnerability is related to improper implementation of SSL encryption as highlighted by the FTC settlement with Fandango and Credit Karma.
- The document lists workarounds like avoiding untrusted networks and using a web browser instead of the app where possible.
