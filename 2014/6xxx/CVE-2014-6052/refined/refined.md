{
  "cve": "CVE-2014-6052",
  "description": "The HandleRFBServerMessage function in libvncclient/rfbproto.c in LibVNCServer did not check certain malloc return values, which allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by specifying a large screen size in a (1) FramebufferUpdate, (2) ResizeFrameBuffer, or (3) PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer message.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "<= 0.9.9"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `HandleRFBServerMessage` function in `libvncclient/rfbproto.c` lacks proper checks on the return values of `malloc`, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of `malloc` return value checking",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious VNC server can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code by specifying a large screen size in `FramebufferUpdate`, `ResizeFrameBuffer`, or `PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer` messages. The vulnerability occurs due to the absence of checks on the return value of `malloc` during framebuffer setup.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted RFB messages with a large screen size"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A malicious VNC server is required to exploit the vulnerability and can do so by sending malformed messages to the client application.",
        "attacker_positioning": "The attacker needs to control a VNC server that a vulnerable client connects to. A man-in-the-middle could also exploit this vulnerability. "
