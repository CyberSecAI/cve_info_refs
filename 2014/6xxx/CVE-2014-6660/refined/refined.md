The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6660.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure the certificate presented by the server is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. This includes a failure to check if the server's certificate is signed by a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This can lead to:
    - Viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
    - Credential stealing.
    - Arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific application.

**Attack vectors:**
    - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device.
    - The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic (MITM).
