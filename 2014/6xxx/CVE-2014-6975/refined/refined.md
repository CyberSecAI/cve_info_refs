  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-6975",
      "description": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections, which may allow an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.",
      "root_cause": "The applications do not properly validate the SSL chain to ensure the certificate was issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper verification of server certificate in SSL/TLS communication."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
      "attack_vector": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the device.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's device and be able to intercept and modify network traffic."
    }
  ],
  "additional_information": {
    "affected_applications": "The provided document links to a spreadsheet containing a list of affected applications and their status. A total of 23,667 apps out of 1,000,462 tested failed the SSL validation.",
    "solution": "Apply an update for the affected applications or avoid using the applications on untrusted networks. Accessing resources through a web browser instead of an affected app can also mitigate the risk. A spreadsheet containing information about affected applications and fixes is available (if you are unable to access the spreadsheet, a static copy is provided as well).",
      "testing_methodology": "The applications were tested with CERT Tapioca. Details on the methodology are available on the CERT/CC blog.",
       "acknowledgements": "Vulnerability reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC, with additional contributions from Tony Trummer, Tushar Dalvi, Kuo Chiang, Sascha Fahl, Marian Harbach, Thomas Muders, Matthew Smith, Lars Baumg√§rtner, and Bernd Freisleben."
