The provided document contains information about CVE-2014-6328, along with other vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-080.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of CVE-2014-6328 is a flaw in how the Internet Explorer XSS filter disables HTML attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is an XSS filter bypass. The XSS filter in Internet Explorer incorrectly disables HTML attributes in filtered HTTP response data. This allows disabled scripts to run in the wrong security context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure. The attacker could execute script code on another user's system in the context of a third-party website. This allows the script to perform any action that the third-party website is permitted to take on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could post specially crafted content on a website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then needs to convince a user to view the content on the affected website. If a user views the content, the XSS filter incorrectly disables HTML attributes, allowing malicious script to run. This attack vector relies on user interaction, such as clicking a link or visiting a compromised website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to post content on a website, or compromise a website, in order to host the malicious content. The attacker needs to induce the user to visit the webpage with the malicious payload through some form of social engineering (e.g. through an email or instant message).
