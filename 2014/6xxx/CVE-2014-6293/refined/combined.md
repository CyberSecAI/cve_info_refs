# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2014-002: Several vulnerabilities in third party extensions

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the following third-party TYPO3 extensions: alpha\_sitemap, femanager ke\_stats, outstats, px\_phpids, smarty, wec\_map

**Release Date:** February 12, 2014

**Bulletin update:** September 18, 2014 (added CVEs)

**Please read first:** This Collective Security Bulletin (CSB) is a listing of vulnerable extensions with neither significant download numbers, nor other special importance amongst the TYPO3 Community. The intention of CSBs is to reduce the workload of the TYPO3 Security Team and of the maintainers of extensions with vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in TYPO3 core or important extensions will still get the well-known single Security Bulletin each.

Please read the [chapter in the Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/TYPO3/SecurityGuide/GeneralInformation/SecurityBulletins/Index.html) about the different types of Extension Security Bulletins.

All vulnerabilities affect third-party extensions. These extensions are not part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Extension:** Alphabetic Sitemap (alpha\_sitemap)

**Affected Versions:** 0.0.3 and all versions below

**Vulnerability Type:** Cross-Site Scripting

**Severity:** Medium

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "Opens external link in new window") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**CVE:** CVE-2014-6291

**Solution:** Versions of this extension that are known to be vulnerable will no longer be available for download from the TYPO3 Extension Repository.
