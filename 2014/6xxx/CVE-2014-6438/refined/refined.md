Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) issue within the `URI.decode_www_form_component` method in Ruby versions prior to 1.9.3-p0.  Specifically, the method is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking when parsing long strings that contain a specific pattern (e.g., a long string ending with "%").

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS): The regex engine within `URI.decode_www_form_component` exhibits exponential time complexity, causing excessive processing time when given specific crafted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can craft a malicious string that, when processed by `URI.decode_www_form_component`, causes the Ruby process to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Input: An attacker can send a specially crafted string through the URI method, likely through a web request or other input that utilizes `URI.decode_www_form_component`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply an input string that will be processed by the vulnerable `URI.decode_www_form_component` method of the Ruby application
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability exists within the code itself.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**
The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description by:
- Providing a concrete code snippet that demonstrates the vulnerability: `ruby -v -ruri -e'URI.decode_www_form_component "A string that causes catastrophic backtracking as it gets longer %"'`
- Explaining the cause of the vulnerability as catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine.
- Indicating that this vulnerability is specific to the `URI.decode_www_form_component` method.
- Pinpointing the vulnerable Ruby versions (older than 1.9.2-p330).
- Mentioning that Ruby 1.9.3 and later versions are not affected.
