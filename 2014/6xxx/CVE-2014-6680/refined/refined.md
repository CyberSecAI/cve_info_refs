- Failure to verify the certificate chain

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks are possible
- Attackers on the same network can view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS
- Potential outcomes include credential theft or arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
