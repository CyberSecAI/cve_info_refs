The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6007, which describes a vulnerability in multiple Android applications failing to properly validate SSL certificates.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify the SSL/TLS chain to ensure the certificate presented by the server is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The weakness is the improper implementation of SSL certificate validation within Android applications. This includes not verifying that the certificate is signed by a trusted CA, potentially accepting expired certificates, or other flaws in the validation process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic that should be encrypted by HTTPS. Depending on the application's function, this could lead to credential theft, viewing or modifying sensitive data, or in some cases, arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The primary attack vector is through a MITM attack, where the attacker intercepts network communications between the Android device and a server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be a public Wi-Fi network or any other network where the attacker can intercept traffic.
