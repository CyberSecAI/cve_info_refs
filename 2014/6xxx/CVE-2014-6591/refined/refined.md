Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-6591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a boundary check flaw in the font parsing code within the 2D component of OpenJDK's International Components for Unicode (ICU) library. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in how the ICU library handles font files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the font parsing code accesses memory locations beyond the allocated buffer boundaries. This is caused by a lack of proper input validation when parsing font data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this flaw, a specially crafted font file could be used to disclose portions of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory.
*   **Bypass Java sandbox restrictions**: Untrusted java applets can use this flaw to access protected memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted font file:** An attacker would need to provide a maliciously crafted font file that, when parsed, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*   **Untrusted Java application or applet:** A vulnerable application that uses the ICU library to parse untrusted font files or an applet that loads untrusted fonts from a web server is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious font file to the vulnerable application or have the victim load an applet which loads an untrusted font file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects the layout component of ICU, specifically the part used by OpenJDK's FontManager.
*   The issue was addressed in multiple releases of OpenJDK, Oracle Java, IcedTea and IBM SDK.

The provided documents confirm that CVE-2014-6591 is related to a font parsing out-of-bounds read vulnerability within the ICU component of OpenJDK, which can lead to information disclosure and potentially bypass sandbox restrictions.
