The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6701.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This failure to validate the SSL chain means that the application does not verify if the certificate was issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Lack of verification that the server's certificate is signed by a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Potential to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Possible credential stealing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers positioned on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploitation through untrusted networks such as public WiFi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- Must be on the same network or able to perform a MITM attack via an untrusted network.
