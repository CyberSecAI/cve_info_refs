Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-6185:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) load within the IBM Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) Linux x86_64 client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The client allows loading of arbitrary DSOs, which can be exploited to gain elevated privileges. This is a classic example of insecure library loading.
- The vulnerable component is the `dsmtca` module, which is the Trusted Communications Agent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local, non-root user can gain elevated privileges on the system by exploiting the arbitrary DSO load vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. A user needs to have access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a non-root user account on the Linux x86_64 system where the vulnerable TSM client is installed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects TSM client versions 7.1.0.0 through 7.1.1.2, 6.4.0.0 through 6.4.2.1 and 6.3.0.0 through 6.3.2.2.
- The fix involves removing the arbitrary DSO load capability.
- A temporary workaround involves changing permissions on dsmtca to restrict execution to trusted users.
- The vulnerability was reported by Matthias Kaiser from Daimler TSS GmbH.
