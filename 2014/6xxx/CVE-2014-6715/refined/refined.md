The provided content is related to CVE-2014-6715.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically not verifying that the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This can lead to viewing or modifying network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via a compromised network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This can be achieved by compromising a local network or using an untrusted network such as public WiFi.
