The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6779.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by a server is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically the failure to verify the server's certificate chain against trusted root CAs, as described in CWE-295 and CWE-296.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network can intercept, view, and modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's function.

**Attack vectors:**
Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Android device. This could include untrusted or public WiFi networks. No special skills are required beyond the ability to perform a basic MITM attack.
