Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from symlink and hardlink traversals during Docker image extraction. Specifically, during 'docker pull' and 'docker load' operations, the Docker engine was not properly handling symlinks and hardlinks within the image archive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue due to improper handling of symlinks and hardlinks. This allows a malicious actor to create an image with crafted symlinks/hardlinks that, when extracted on the host, could write files to arbitrary locations, effectively bypassing intended directory boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the path traversal vulnerability, an attacker could overwrite system files, introduce malicious code, or manipulate configurations, leading to privilege escalation on the host system.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the host, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Docker Images:** Attackers can craft malicious Docker images containing specially crafted symlinks/hardlinks.
- **'docker pull' and 'docker load' Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user downloads or loads a malicious image using `docker pull` or `docker load` operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Image Creation:** An attacker needs the ability to create malicious Docker images.
- **Image Distribution/Hosting:** They would need a way to make their crafted images available for download via a registry.
- **User Interaction:** An unwitting user needs to pull or load the malicious image, triggering the vulnerable code.

**Additional Notes:**
- Docker versions up to and including 1.3.1 are vulnerable.
- Docker 1.3.2 introduced fixes by adding additional checks to `pkg/archive` and performing image extraction in a `chroot`, which isolates the extraction process.
- No remediation is available for older versions, and users were advised to upgrade.
