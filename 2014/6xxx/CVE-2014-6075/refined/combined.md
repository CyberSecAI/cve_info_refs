# Security Bulletin: Multiple vulnerabilities found in IBM QRadar SIEM and QRadar Risk Manager (CVE-2014-4832, CVE-2014-4831, CVE-2014-4829, CVE-2014-4829, CVE-2014-6075)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There are multiple security vulnerabilities in various components used by IBM QRadar in versions 7.1 MR2 and 7.2.3.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2014-4832](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4832)

**Description:** A vulnerability in the IBM QRadar Risk Manager application could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information. If the application is accessed via a network with HTTP, an attacker using man-in-the-middle techniques could recover packets for non-encrypted cookies that could potentially contain sensitive session information or credentials.

**Description:** IBM QRadar Risk Manager could allow a remote attacker to hijack a valid user's session, caused by improper validation. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to hijack another user's account and gain the victim's privileges.

*CVSS Base Score:* 4.3

*CVSS Temporal Score:* See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95581> for the current score

*CVSS Environmental Score:*\*: Undefined

*CVSS Vector:* (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2014-4829](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4829)

**Description:** IBM QRadar is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. By persuading an authenticated user to visit a malicious Web site, a remote attacker could send a malformed HTTP. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site scripting attacks, Web cache poisoning, and other malicious activities.

*CVSS Base Score:* 4.3

*CVSS Temporal Score:* See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/95579> for the current score
