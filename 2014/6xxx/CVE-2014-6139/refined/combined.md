##### **Tips**

To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  Using the ?Search? REST API, non-administrative users can search
  for task and process instances that they are not allowed to see
  by specifying a parameter that should only be available to
  administrative users.

  ```

## Local fix

## Problem summary

* ```
  IBM Business Process Manager provides a REST API to search for
  task and process instances. Usually searches return filtered
  result lists, containing only results that the current user is
  authorized to see. For administrative use cases, a parameter
  called ?filterByCurrentUser? was introduced to also enable
  unfiltered searches (by setting it to ?false?).

  However, there is no authorization check in place to verify that
  the current user is an administrative user who is allowed to
  specify this parameter, so that the result may contain task and
  process instances he is not authorized to see - potentially
  containing sensitive information.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  A fix is available for IBM BPM that adds an authorization check
  for the REST API which verifies that only administrative users
  are allowed to perform unfiltered searches.  The parameter is
  ignored and defaults to filtered searches for all other users.

  On Fix Central (http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral), search

  additional installation instructions and information about the
  fix.
