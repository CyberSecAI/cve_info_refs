{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient authorization checks in the REST API for searching task and process instances.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The search API allows non-administrative users to specify the `filterByCurrentUser=false` parameter, which is intended only for administrative users. This allows non-admin users to bypass result filtering and view data they are not authorized to access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Non-administrative users can access task and process instances that they are not authorized to view, potentially exposing sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "By using the search REST API with the parameter `filterByCurrentUser=false`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a non-administrative user with access to the IBM Business Process Manager search API."
