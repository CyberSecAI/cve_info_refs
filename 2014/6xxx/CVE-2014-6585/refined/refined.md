Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-6585 from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2014-6585 is a boundary check flaw within the font parsing code of the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library. This flaw resides specifically in the 2D component of OpenJDK, which is used by FontManager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The vulnerability allows for an out-of-bounds read. A crafted font file can cause the application using ICU to read data outside of the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this to potentially expose portions of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive data by reading memory outside the buffer.
*   **Bypass sandbox restrictions:** An untrusted Java application or applet could potentially use this flaw to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions, increasing the severity of the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through specially crafted font files. These files could be delivered through various means, including malicious websites, or included in documents.
*   **Context-dependent:** The vulnerability is exploitable when a Java application using ICU is parsing untrusted font files. This means that the vulnerability can only be leveraged when the vulnerable code is used to parse malicious input data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide a crafted font file:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted font file to a system that will process the file using a vulnerable version of OpenJDK and ICU.
*   **Remote access (in some cases):** In some scenarios, especially web browsers or other applications that handle external/untrusted content, an attacker could be remote via a malicious site or an email, for example.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to a flaw in the ICU library used by OpenJDK, which impacts the parsing of font files
*   The vulnerability was also fixed in IcedTea6 1.13.6 and IcedTea7 2.5.4.

The provided information suggests that the vulnerability can be exploited both remotely and locally depending on the use case of vulnerable software. Specifically, if the user can be tricked into parsing malicious font files, an attacker would be able to execute arbitrary code, gain access to sensitive data, or cause a Denial of Service.
