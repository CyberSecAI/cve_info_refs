Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-6502:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `LogRecord` class in OpenJDK incorrectly using a class loader when loading a `ResourceBundle`. This leads to the potential loading of an incorrect `ResourceBundle`.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Class Loader Usage:** The `LogRecord` class uses an inappropriate class loader during deserialization. This can allow a malicious class loader to load resources which can subvert intended security measures
*   **ResourceBundle Manipulation:** An incorrect class loader can lead to loading an attacker controlled ResourceBundle instead of a legitimate one.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Java Sandbox Restrictions:** A malicious Java application or applet could exploit this vulnerability to bypass certain Java sandbox restrictions.
*  **Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially exploit the incorrect resource bundle loading to inject and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or service running the vulnerable application.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. An attacker can exploit the flaw through a network.
*   **Malicious Applet/Application:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability through a malicious Java applet or application.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft or manipulate malicious resource bundles and/or inject them into the affected system.
*   The attacker needs a way to load a malicous class that can exploit this weakness.
*  No user authentication or interaction is required, but exploitation relies on the loading of a malformed or manipulated Java component.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects various versions of IBM and Oracle Java SE, as well as OpenJDK. Specific versions include:
    *   OpenJDK 7, 8, 1.5.0, 1.6.0, 1.7.0, 1.7.1
    *   IBM Java 5, 6, 7, 7.1
    *   Oracle Java SE 5.0u71, 6u81, 6u85, 7u67, 7u71, 8u20 and 8u25
    * Java SE Embedded 7u60.
*   **Specific Components:** The vulnerability is located in the Libraries component of OpenJDK.
*   **Mitigation:**  The primary mitigation is to upgrade the vulnerable Java installations to the patched version. In the case of some IBM JDKs, SSL 3.0 is also disabled as part of the remediation.
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerability was discovered by researchers at Red Hat Product Security.

Based on this analysis, the vulnerability is related to a coding flaw when loading resource bundles, allowing a malicious actor to potentially execute arbitrary code, or disclose sensitive information.
