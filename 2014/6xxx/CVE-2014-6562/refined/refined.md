  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Libraries component in OpenJDK failed to properly handle ZIP archives that contain entries with a NUL byte used in the file names.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of NUL bytes in ZIP archive entries",
       "Failure to sanitize file names during ZIP extraction",
      "Bypass of Java sandbox restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "An untrusted Java application or applet could use this flaw to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. When extracting data from such archives, OpenJDK could use different file than expected.",

        "Malicious ZIP archive",
         "Untrusted Java application or applet",
          "Exploitation during ZIP file extraction"
