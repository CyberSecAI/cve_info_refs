Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means they do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper verification of the SSL/TLS certificate chain. This is a violation of secure coding practice DRD19-J from the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java.
*   **Trust Anchor Issue:** Applications fail to ensure that the server's certificate is issued by a trusted root CA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker on the same network can intercept, view, or modify traffic between the application and the server, even though the application thinks it is using a secure connection.
*   **Credential Stealing:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive user credentials transmitted over the network.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, the vulnerability could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is network-based, requiring the attacker to be positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
*   **MITM attack:** An attacker intercepts communication between the app and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Same Network:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's Android device, such as a public Wi-Fi network.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept network traffic, which can be done through various MITM techniques.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified through dynamic testing using CERT Tapioca.
*   A spreadsheet is available that lists vulnerable applications and their respective fixes.
*   The issue is widespread, affecting a significant number of Android applications.
*   The vulnerability is also tracked as VU#582497 by CERT/CC.
* The document mentions previous FTC settlements against Fandango and Credit Karma for similar SSL implementation issues in their mobile apps.

This information provides a good overview of the security issue described by VU#582497 which is associated with the general class of vulnerabilities described by CVE-2014-6826.
