### @iliakan **[iliakan](/iliakan)** commented [Sep 4, 2014](#issue-41964885)

Without that fix, a path `/my-secret` is consedered fine for the root `/my`.

Maybe the issue is autofixed by the next `parts` assignment? Not sure exactly if the vulnerability exists, but the comparison is insecure.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Subject: Re: CVE request: various NodeJS module vulnerabilities

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> qs Denial-of-Service Memory Exhaustion
> <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/qs_dos_memory_exhaustion>

The description seems to suggest that there should be an arbitrary
limit on the index value. That, by itself, might not be considered a
vulnerability report; however, omitting the call to the compact
function can probably be considered a security problem. Use
CVE-2014-7191 for the
<https://github.com/raymondfeng/node-querystring/commit/43a604b7847e56bba49d0ce3e222fe89569354d8>
commit.

> qs Denial-of-Service Extended Event Loop Blocking
> <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/qs_dos_extended_event_loop_blocking>

This has no references to the specific code changes, and the
discussion suggests that this is a security enhancement -- adding new
resource-limit functionality that hadn't existed before 1.0.0 -- not a
fix to the implementation of existing functionality. Accordingly, no
CVE ID is currently being assigned.

> syntax-error potential for script injection
> <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/syntax-error-potential-script-injection>

This seems to have multiple possible interpretations of where the
vulnerability is.

"In node 0.10, Function() seems to be implemented in terms of eval(),
so malicious code can execute even if the function returned by
Function() was never called" doesn't seem to be a statement of an eval
injection vulnerability affecting all 0.10.x versions. Instead,
<https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/syntax-error-potential-script-injection>
seems to be only about the
<https://github.com/substack/node-syntax-error/commit/9aa4e66eb90ec595d2dba55e6f9c2dd9a668b309>
commit. The affected product is only the syntax-error package from the
<http://www.npmjs.org/package/syntax-error> web site.

Use CVE-2014-7192.

> send Directory Traversal
> <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/send-directory-traversal>

The CVE ID is already listed on that web page.

> Crumb CORS Token Disclosure
> <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/crumb_cors_token_disclosure>

Use CVE-2014-7193.

> Arbitrary JavaScript Execution in Bassmaster
> <https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/bassmaster_js_injection>

Use CVE-2014-7205.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1146063#c0)  Vasyl Kaigorodov    2014-09-24 11:39:25 UTC  ``` When relying on the root option to restrict file access it may be possible for an application consumer to escape out of the restricted directory and access files in a similarly named directory. For example, static(_dirname + '/public') would allow access to _dirname + '/public-restricted'.
