Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6918:

**Verification:**

The provided content from `www.kb.cert.org` directly references "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates", which is the vulnerability described by VU#582497. The Google docs spreadsheet also is a supporting document for the identified vulnerability. Although no CVE was assigned, the content is relevant to the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This means the apps do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper verification of the SSL/TLS certificate chain. This includes not checking if the certificate is signed by a trusted CA.
*   **Lack of Secure Communication:** The vulnerability allows for insecure communication over HTTPS due to the failure to validate the server's identity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can intercept and modify network traffic that is supposed to be protected by HTTPS.
*   **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data transmitted by the application, such as credentials, can be exposed to the attacker.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some cases, successful exploitation could lead to the ability to execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attacks:** The attack vector is through the network. The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This can be a public Wi-Fi network or a compromised local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network (local or wireless) as the vulnerable Android device.
*   **Interception Ability:** The attacker needs the capability to intercept and modify network traffic.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable applications.
