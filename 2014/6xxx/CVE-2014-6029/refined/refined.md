Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-6029:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `getCookie` function in `torrentflux/www/functions.php`. This function is used to retrieve cookie information from the database. The vulnerability lies in the ability to access and manipulate cookies of other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application allows authenticated users to access and modify cookies of other users through the `profile.php?op=editCookies` endpoint. This is achieved by iterating through the `cid` parameter. This suggests a lack of proper access controls or validation when retrieving and manipulating user cookies.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** The vulnerability occurs because the application allows direct manipulation of cookies using the `cid` parameter without proper authorization checks. This is a form of a direct object reference vulnerability, where users can manipulate internal object identifiers directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Manipulation:** An authenticated attacker can delete or modify cookies belonging to other users. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** By modifying session cookies, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Depending on what the cookies are used for, the attacker could also manipulate user data associated with the modified cookies.
    *  **Denial of Service:** By deleting cookies, the attacker could log out or disrupt the sessions of other users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the web interface by sending HTTP requests to `profile.php?op=editCookies` with a modified `cid` parameter. The attacker iterates the `cid` to access and manipulate cookies of other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the torrentflux web application.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific URL (`profile.php?op=editCookies`) and the `cid` parameter to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Ability to send web requests:** The attacker has to be able to send HTTP requests to the torrentflux server.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in version 2.4.5-1 of the torrentflux package.
*   The vulnerability is related to, but distinct from, CVE-2014-6028, which is about the ability to read user cookies using similar methods. CVE-2014-6029 is specifically about the ability to *modify or delete* cookies.
*   The fix for this vulnerability led to the removal of the torrentflux package from Debian unstable.
