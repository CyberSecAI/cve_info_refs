The provided content is a security advisory for phpMyFAQ version 2.8, specifically addressing multiple vulnerabilities.  It includes a mention of CVE-2014-6046.

Based on the advisory, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2014-6046:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in specific functionalities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF vulnerability in "delete user" functionality:** An attacker could potentially trick an administrator into deleting a user without their knowledge or consent.
*   **CSRF vulnerability in deleting open questions:** Lack of CSRF tokens allows an attacker to delete any open question without the user's explicit action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Deletion:** Attackers could delete user accounts, potentially disrupting access and services.
*   **Content Deletion:** Attackers could delete open questions, leading to loss of important information and disruption of the platform's knowledge base.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can craft malicious links or embed malicious content on a different website, which, when clicked by an authenticated user of phpMyFAQ, triggers the unauthorized actions (user deletion or open question deletion) on the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking on a malicious link or interacting with malicious content.
*   The attacker does not require direct access to the phpMyFAQ application itself, but rather relies on the user's browser and established session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory clearly states that these CSRF issues are assigned to CVE-2014-6046, thus confirming this CVE is relevant.
*   The advisory highlights that there is no workaround, and updating to phpMyFAQ 2.8.13 is required to fix the vulnerabilities.
