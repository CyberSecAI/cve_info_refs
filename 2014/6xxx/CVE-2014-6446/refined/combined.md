## Infusionsoft Gravity Forms Add-on 1.5.3 - 1.5.10, Arbitrary File Upload

The Infusionsoft Gravity Forms Add-on plugin for WordPress has a script included in the default plugin installation which is intended to allow the user to re-generate certain templates, however there is no authentication required to access this script, and no validation on user input, which allows the user to write arbitrary content to files either owner by the web servers user, or new files under a directory owned by (or accessible by) the web servers user. This can lead to arbitrary code execution, via custom PHP files.

### Homepage

<https://wordpress.org/plugins/infusionsoft/>

### CVSS Score

6.4

### CSSS Vector

(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N)

### Attack Scope

remote

### Authorization Required

None

### Mitigation

Update to version 1.5.11

### Proof of Concept

Upon installation of the plugin, browse toÂ http://localhost/wp-content/plugins/infusionsoft/Infusionsoft/utilities/code\_generator.php. Once at this URL, you are able to input any PHP source you wish (such as a PHP web shell). When you click submit, the script will output to a number of templates the PHP source you specified in the first step. You are then able to browse to any of these scripts by name, and the PHP source will be executed.

Last year, I knew I was dealing with a ticking time bomb for a plugin that hasn’t been updated in over four years, and now the bomb has gone off. This plugin no longer works for any new forms that are created. It just spins.
Game over. Wordpress should remove this plugin from its directory, because clearly the developer has abandoned it and NO ONE should waste any time installing and activating this plugin until it is updated.

I’ve been using this plugin for 4 years on multiple websites. Works great but I just wish the developer would release updates to improve the interface and functionality.
Thank you!

We use it all the time to connect Gravity Forms to Infusionsoft. The only wish I had was that the Entry Tag’s field was wider.

A brilliant plugin when it worked – but it hasn’t been updated in ages – and now produces errors when submitting forms on iOS or OS X Safari. Time out issues.. This unfortunately makes the form unusable. Shame.

It seems to work on PHP 5.6 and below as an interim fix

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
