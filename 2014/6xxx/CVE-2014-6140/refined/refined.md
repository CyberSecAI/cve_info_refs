Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6140:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the use of static `secret_token` values in multiple IBM Endpoint Manager Mobile Device Management components which are built using Ruby on Rails framework. These static tokens are used to generate HMACs for session cookies.
- Instead of generating unique random `secret_token` during installation, IBM's product reuses the same static values across all deployments. This allows an attacker to discover these values and forge valid session cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Static secret tokens:** The core weakness is the use of static, predictable secret tokens in the Ruby on Rails applications.
- **Insecure deserialization:** The application deserializes session cookies without proper validation, allowing attackers to inject malicious marshalled Ruby objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting malicious session cookies, an attacker can achieve unauthenticated remote code execution with administrative privileges on the vulnerable server.
- **Full System Compromise:** The advisory states that successful exploitation of the vulnerability on the application server can lead to a full compromise of all devices managed by the product.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests with malicious session cookies.
- **Cookie Forgery:** Attackers use the static secret token to forge valid session cookies.
- **Ruby Object Deserialization:** The application deserializes the attacker-controlled data from the session cookies, leading to code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IBM Endpoint Manager server (typically accessible via HTTPS on port 443).
- **Knowledge of Static Secret Tokens:** The attacker must be able to obtain the static `secret_token` values for the specific IBM Endpoint Manager component they intend to target. This information can be obtained by inspecting the application archives (.war files).
- **Exploitation Tools:** The attacker can leverage Metasploit or similar tools to automate the exploitation process.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- **Affected Components:**
    - Enrollment and Apple iOS Management Extender
    - Mobile Device Management Self-Service Portal
    - Mobile Device Management Admin Portal
    - Trusted Service Provider
- **Affected Versions:** All versions prior to 9.0.60100.
- **Exploitation:** The provided content includes details of how the vulnerability can be exploited using Metasploit, including modified ruby payload to account for the Java/Jruby environment.
- **Secret Tokens and Cookie Names:** The advisory lists the specific cookie names and their corresponding static `secret_token` values for each affected component.
