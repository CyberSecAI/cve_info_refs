Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6335:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from Microsoft Word's improper handling of objects in memory when parsing specially crafted Office files. Specifically, this improper handling leads to memory corruption, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is described as an "Invalid Pointer" issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper memory management while parsing specially crafted Office files.
- The vulnerability is due to a logic error that allows attackers to overwrite parts of memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, an attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/modifying/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
- Users with fewer privileges would be less impacted, but they are still vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Office file as an email attachment. The user must open the attachment for the exploit to succeed.
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing a specially crafted Office file. The user must be convinced to visit the website and then open the file. Compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content are also potential attack vectors.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted Office file that triggers the vulnerability.
- The attacker must convince the user to open the crafted file, either through email or by luring them to a website.
- No specific user position is needed for exploitation other than having a vulnerable application installed.
- The attacker must be able to reach the victim via email or web to deliver the crafted file.
