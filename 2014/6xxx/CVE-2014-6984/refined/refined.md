The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This occurs because the applications do not verify if the certificate was provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation when establishing HTTPS connections.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. This allows the attacker to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be a public Wi-Fi network or a compromised local network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server it is communicating with. This generally requires the attacker to be on the same network as the device.
