Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6260:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The page command used for sending alerts in Zenoss can be edited by users with sufficient permissions without requiring them to re-enter their password. This differs from other command editing within the system that do require password re-entry.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient access control: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks when modifying the page command. The system does not require a password re-entry for this action, unlike other similar actions within Zenoss.
- Session Hijacking potential: If an attacker gains access to an administrator's session, they can modify the pager command due to missing authentication requirements for this specific action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Disruption of Notifications: An attacker could modify the pager command, causing users to no longer receive alerts or notifications.
- Arbitrary Command Execution: A malicious actor could modify the pager command to execute arbitrary system commands by injecting malicious code into the pager command, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Session hijacking: An attacker could gain access to an active administrator session. This can be achieved through various means including gaining access to an unlocked computer, or other attacks that allow session takeover.
- Malicious Configuration Change: Once inside the session, the attacker would modify the pager command through the interface without needing to re-enter the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to an administrator session: An attacker needs to be able to access an active and authenticated administrator session.
- Knowledge of Zenoss interface: The attacker needs to be familiar with the Zenoss interface in order to modify the pager command.
