**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's failure to properly enforce cross-domain policies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper enforcement of cross-domain policies. This allows a potential attacker to bypass security restrictions that prevent scripts from one domain from accessing data in a different domain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone. This could expose sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a web-based attack scenario where the attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites, or websites that host user-provided content, could also be used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host or control a website or a web page that is visited by the target user. They would need to convince the user to visit the malicious site. This can be done by tricking users into clicking on a link.
- The attacker does not have the ability to force users to view the malicious content.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10 and 11
- The vulnerability is rated "Important" on Windows Clients and "Low" on Windows Servers
- Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server can mitigate the risk for websites not in the Trusted Sites zone.
