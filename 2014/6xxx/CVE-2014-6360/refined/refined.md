**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Excel improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of objects in memory during the parsing of specially crafted Office files.
- Memory corruption that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, including:
    - Installing programs
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data
    - Creating new accounts with full user rights

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email Attack:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Excel file to the user, convincing them to open it.
- **Web-based Attack:** An attacker hosts a website containing the malicious file. Users are lured to the site (e.g., via links in emails/IM) and convinced to open the file.
- Compromised websites and websites that accept user-provided content could also host malicious content to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to create a specially crafted Microsoft Excel file.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the file in a vulnerable version of Microsoft Excel.
- For web based attacks, the attacker needs to host a webpage and convince the user to visit that page and open the file.
- The attacker needs to have the victim execute the file in an affected version of excel.
