The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6961.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This occurs when an application does not verify the SSL chain to ensure that the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- The attacker can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
