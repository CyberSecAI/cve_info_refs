{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the SSL chain, not ensuring the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim and able to intercept/modify network traffic between the vulnerable application and the server it is communicating with."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "testing_methodology": "The vulnerability was detected by dynamic testing using CERT Tapioca.",
    "affected_applications": "Thousands of Android applications failed dynamic SSL validation testing. Details of affected applications and available fixes are maintained in a spreadsheet (link provided).",
    "mitigations": [
        "Apply updates for the affected applications.",
        "Do not use the affected applications where possible, instead accessing content through a web browser.",
        "Avoid using untrusted networks, such as public WiFi."
    ],
     "vendor_information": "Several vendors were notified about this issue, but many did not provide a statement."
