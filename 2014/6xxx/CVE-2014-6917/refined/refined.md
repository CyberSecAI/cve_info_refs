The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6917.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they don't verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation
- Failure to verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is provided by a trusted root CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- An attacker on the same network can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Possible credential stealing and arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- Exploitation of the vulnerability occurs when the device communicates via HTTPS with a server presenting a malicious certificate or traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic (e.g., by controlling a Wi-Fi access point).

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is widespread, affecting many Android applications.
- A spreadsheet ([Android application SSL spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing)) is maintained to track affected applications and available fixes.
- The issue was discovered through dynamic testing using a tool called CERT Tapioca.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation) and CWE-296 (Improper Handling of Certificate Validation).
- The base CVSS score is 7.8 with vector AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N.
- The temporal CVSS score is 7 with vector E:F/RL:W/RC:C.
- The environmental CVSS score is 7.5 with vector CDP:ND/TD:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:ND.
