Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6357:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Word improperly handles objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which occurs when a program attempts to use memory after it has been freed, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Word file to a user and convince them to open it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker can host a website that contains a specially crafted file, or exploit compromised websites or sites with user-provided content. The attacker would then need to convince users to visit the website and open the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted Word file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted file. This could be done via social engineering through email, instant messenger or by hosting a malicious file on a website.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is rated as "Critical".
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting the way that Microsoft Word parses specially crafted files.
- This vulnerability affects various versions of Microsoft Word, Office, and related server products.
