Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. They do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper SSL certificate chain validation. Applications are not verifying if the server's certificate is signed by a trusted CA.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept, view, and modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
*   **Credential Stealing:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information such as usernames and passwords.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some scenarios, the attacker might be able to inject code. The impact varies depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based MITM:** The vulnerability is exploited through a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker intercepts the communication between the Android application and the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **On the Same Network:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device, such as an untrusted public Wi-Fi network.
*   **Ability to Intercept Traffic:** The attacker must be capable of intercepting and manipulating network traffic.

**Additional Information:**

*   The CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) tested over 1 million Android apps and found over 23,000 failed dynamic SSL validation testing.
*   The vulnerability was found in multiple Android apps, making it a widespread issue.
*   A spreadsheet is available with a list of vulnerable apps.
*   The issue can be mitigated by using web browsers instead of vulnerable applications.
*  The issue is also mentioned in relation to two vendors, Fandango and Credit Karma, that settled charges with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for failing to secure personal information transmission

This vulnerability is related to the following CWEs:
* CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation
* CWE-296: Improper Following of a Certificate's Chain of Trust
