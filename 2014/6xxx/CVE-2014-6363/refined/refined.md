         "root_cause": "A specially crafted script can cause the VBScript engine to access data before initializing it.  Specifically, during normal operation of RegExp.Execute method the code executes the CRegExp::Execute which creates a CMatch object for each match.

For Windows Script Host the attacker needs to execute a malicious script on the target machine. For IIS the attacker would need to either find an ASP page that accepts a regular expression and string, or be able to inject vbscript to an ASP page.",
