- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The HTTPInput node in WebSphere Message Broker and IBM Integration Bus can return a SOAP fault that includes sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper error handling leading to the disclosure of sensitive information within SOAP fault messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive information can be disclosed, which can be used to conduct further attacks on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending requests that result in errors processed by the HTTPInput node.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the vulnerable HTTPInput node, which is likely through a network connection.
