The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6737.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This occurs when the application does not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically the failure to verify the certificate chain against trusted CAs. This can result from the application not properly implementing the necessary checks.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This allows the attacker to intercept and potentially view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. The specific impact varies based on the application's functionality, with possibilities including credential theft and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle attack, requiring the attacker to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. The attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and the server, presenting a fraudulent certificate.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be on the same network as the victim's Android device (e.g. a shared public wifi network). The attacker needs to be capable of intercepting network traffic and presenting a fake SSL certificate to the vulnerable application.
