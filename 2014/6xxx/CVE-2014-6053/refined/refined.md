{
  "cveId": "CVE-2014-6053",
  "description": "The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer 0.9.9 and earlier does not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted message that is processed by using a single unchecked malloc.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage` function in `libvncserver/rfbserver.c` does not properly handle large ClientCutText messages.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unchecked malloc: The function uses a single `malloc` call without checking its return value. When a large `ClientCutText` message is received, `malloc` may fail, leading to a crash.",
        "Lack of input validation: The function does not validate the size of the `ClientCutText` message, allowing an attacker to specify a very large size."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by sending a crafted `ClientCutText` message, leading to memory consumption or a daemon crash.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Network: The attacker sends a malicious message to a vulnerable VNC server over the network."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send crafted VNC messages to a vulnerable server. No authentication is explicitly required in some cases (e.g., when a VNC server is running in password-less mode or the attacker is in a man-in-the-middle position), but in other cases, a valid connection is necessary.",
     "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is present in the server-side code of LibVNCServer when processing the ClientCutText message. A large, attacker-controlled size is passed to malloc without checking for failure. This can lead to a crash or memory exhaustion. The vulnerability is also present in RealVNC, and affects other VNC implementations."
