                 CVE-2019-15681

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of iTALC, a
classroom management software. All vulnerabilities referenced below are
issues that have originally been reported against Debian source package
libvncserver. The italc source package in Debian ships a custom-patched
version of libvncserver, thus libvncserver's security fixes required
porting over.

CVE-2014-6051

    Integer overflow in the MallocFrameBuffer function in vncviewer.c in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) and possibly executed arbitrary code via an advertisement for
    a large screen size, which triggered a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2014-6052

    The HandleRFBServerMessage function in libvncclient/rfbproto.c in
    LibVNCServer did not check certain malloc return values, which
    allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by specifying a large
    screen size in a (1) FramebufferUpdate, (2) ResizeFrameBuffer, or (3)
    PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer message.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
    attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
    daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
    single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2014-6054

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and server crash) via
    a zero value in the scaling factor in a (1) PalmVNCSetScaleFactor or
    (2) SetScale message.

CVE-2014-6055

    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the File Transfer feature in
    rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote authenticated users to
    cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
    via a (1) long file or (2) directory name or the (3) FileTime
    attribute in a rfbFileTransferOffer message.

CVE-2016-9941

    Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the
    client drawing area.

CVE-2016-9942

    Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer
    allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO
    payload decompressed length exceeded what is specified by the tile
    dimensions.

CVE-2018-6307

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-7225

    An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer.
    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2018-15126

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-15127

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability in server code
    of file transfer extension that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20749

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20750

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20019

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bound write vulnerabilities in
    VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20748

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in
    libvncclient/rfbproto.c. The fix for CVE-2018-20019 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20020

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability inside
    structure in VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20021

    LibVNC contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop vulnerability in VNC client
    code. Vulnerability allows attacker to consume excessive amount of
    resources like CPU and RAM

CVE-2018-20022

    LibVNC contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper Initialization
    vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed attackers to read stack
    memory and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with
    another vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout
    and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20023

    LibVNC contained CWE-665: Improper Initialization vulnerability in
    VNC Repeater client code that allowed attacker to read stack memory
    and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another
    vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout and in
    bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20024

    LibVNC contained null pointer dereference in VNC client code that
    could result DoS.

CVE-2019-15681

    LibVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could be abused for
    information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could
    be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appeared to
    be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.0.2+dfsg1-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your italc packages.

# Multiple issues in libVNCserver

---

*From*: Nicolas RUFF <nicolas.ruff () gmail com>

*Date*: Tue, 23 Sep 2014 23:47:05 +0200

```
Hello list,

I am currently reviewing libVNCserver for potential security issues.

Project home is: <https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver>

Here are my findings so far. Found bugs are either client- or server-side
(libVNCserver provides both). All bugs require authentication. However they
still pose a significant issue in the following scenarios:
* VNC server is running in password-less mode because authentication is
required afterwards (e.g. X11 login screen).
* Attacker is located in a man-in-the-middle position.
* Attacker has legitimate access to the VNC server but possibly not to the
host server (e.g. virtual machine, remote assistance to a customer).

Fixes are being committed - a few of them are still pending in the pull
request.

CVE-2014-6051 Integer overflow in MallocFrameBuffer() on client side.

A malicious VNC server could advertise a very large screen size (by RFB
protocol, width and height are 16-bit integers), resulting in an integer
overflow during malloc() on client-side. Heap corruption, and possibly
remote code execution on client-side could ensue.

CVE-2014-6052 Lack of malloc() return value checking on client side.

malloc() return value was not checked on client-side during framebuffer
setup. A malicious VNC server that advertises a large enough screen size to
make malloc() fail could basically map the framebuffer at address 0, and
write anything-anywhere in client process memory using selective
FramebufferUpdate messages. This could certainly turn into remote code
execution on client-side.

CVE-2014-6053 Server crash on a very large ClientCutText message.

A malicious client could advertise a very large ClientCutText message size
(by RFB protocol, size is encoded on a 32-bit integer). malloc() is likely
to fail in that case; as malloc() return value is not checked, this will
most likely result in a server crash.

Note: this issue also affects RealVNC as per CVE-2010-5304.
<http://www.iss.net/security_center/reference/vuln/VNC_Client_Cut_Text_DoS.htm>
<http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/89160/RealVNC-VNC-Server-Free-Edition-4.1.3-Denial-Of-Service.html>

CVE-2014-6054 Server crash when scaling factor is set to zero.

A malicious client could set the scaling factor to 0, which will result in
a server crash (division by zero).

CVE-2014-6055 Multiple stack overflows in File Transfer feature.

1/ The non-standard file transfer messages (UltraVNC feature) will blindly
strcpy() client-provided file and directory names into a stack-based buffer
of size MAX_PATH, resulting in multiple stack-based buffer overflows on
server-side.

2/ Client-supplied FileTime attribute is copied into a stack-based
buffer of size 64 during rfbFileTransferOffer message parsing, resulting in
a stack-based buffer overflow on server-side.

Regards,
- Nicolas RUFF

**oCERT-2014-007 libvncserver multiple issues**

**Description**:

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical sharing system based on
the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol.

The [LibVNCServer](http://libvnc.github.io)
project, an open source library for implementing VNC compliant communication,
suffers from a number of bugs that can be potentially exploited with security
impact.

Various implementation issues resulting in remote code execution and/or DoS
conditions on both the VNC server and client side have been discovered.

1. A malicious VNC server can trigger incorrect memory management
   handling by advertising a large screen size parameter to the VNC
   client. This would result in multiple memory corruptions and could
   allow remote code execution on the VNC client.
2. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple DoS conditions on the VNC
   server by advertising a large screen size, ClientCutText message length
   and/or a zero scaling factor parameter.
3. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple stack-based buffer
   overflows by passing a long file and directory names and/or attributes
   (FileTime) when using the file transfer message feature.

It should be noted that every described issue represents a
post-authentication bug, therefore the server side conditions can be
anonymously leveraged only if the VNC server is configured to allow
unauthenticated sessions.

**Affected version**:

[LibVNCServer](http://libvnc.github.io) <= 0.9.9

**Fixed version**:

[LibVNCServer](http://libvnc.github.io), N/A

**Credit**: vulnerability report received from Nicolas Ruff of Google Security Team
<nruff AT google.com>.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: [oCERT-2014-007] libvncserver multiple issues

#2014-007 libvncserver multiple issues

Description:

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical sharing system based on the
Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol.

The LibVNCServer project, an open source library for implementing VNC
compliant communication, suffers from a number of bugs that can be potentially
exploited with security impact.

Various implementation issues resulting in remote code execution and/or DoS
conditions on both the VNC server and client side have been discovered.

 1. A malicious VNC server can trigger incorrect memory management
    handling by advertising a large screen size parameter to the VNC
    client. This would result in multiple memory corruptions and could
    allow remote code execution on the VNC client.

 2. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple DoS conditions on the VNC
    server by advertising a large screen size, ClientCutText message
    length and/or a zero scaling factor parameter.

 3. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple stack-based buffer
    overflows by passing a long file and directory names and/or attributes
    (FileTime) when using the file transfer message feature.

It should be noted that every described issue represents a post-authentication
bug, therefore the server side conditions can be anonymously leveraged only if
the VNC server is configured to allow unauthenticated sessions.

Affected version:

LibVNCServer <= 0.9.9

Fixed version:

LibVNCServer, N/A

                 CVE-2018-20022 CVE-2019-15678 CVE-2019-15679 CVE-2019-15680
                 CVE-2019-15681
Debian Bug     : 945364

Several vulnerabilities have recently been discovered in TightVNC 1.x, an
X11 based VNC server/viewer application for Windows and Unix.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in rfbserver.c in TightVNC
    server did not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of
    ClientCutText data, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted message
    that was processed by using a single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2018-7225

    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2019-8287

    TightVNC code contained global buffer overflow in HandleCoRREBBP
    macro function, which could potentially have result in code
    execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

    (aka CVE-2018-20020/libvncserver)

CVE-2018-20021

    TightVNC in vncviewer/rfbproto.c contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop
    vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to consume
    an excessive amount of resources like CPU and RAM.

CVE-2018-20022

    TightVNC's vncviewer contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper
    Initialization vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed
    attackers to read stack memory and could be abused for information
    disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could be used to
    leak stack memory layout and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2019-15678

    TightVNC code version contained heap buffer overflow in
    rfbServerCutText handler, which could have potentially resulted in
    code execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

    (partially aka CVE-2018-20748/libvnvserver)

CVE-2019-15679

    TightVNC's vncviewer code contained a heap buffer overflow in
    InitialiseRFBConnection function, which could have potentially
    resulted in code execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable
    via network connectivity.

    (partially aka CVE-2018-20748/libvnvserver)

CVE-2019-15680

    TightVNC's vncviewer code contained a null pointer dereference in
    HandleZlibBPP function, which could have resulted in Denial of System
    (DoS). This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

CVE-2019-15681

    TightVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could have been abused
    for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it
    could have been used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This
    attack appeared to be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.9-6.5+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tightvnc packages.

Package        : vino
Version        : 3.14.0-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-6053 CVE-2018-7225 CVE-2019-15681
Debian Bug     : 945784

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of vino, a
desktop sharing utility for the GNOME desktop environment.

The vulnerabilities referenced below are issues that have originally been
reported against Debian source package libvncserver. The vino source
package in Debian ships a custom-patched and stripped down variant of
libvncserver, thus some of libvncserver's security fixes required porting
over.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
    attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
    daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
    single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2018-7225

    An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer.
    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2019-15681

    LibVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could be abused for
    information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could
    be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appeared to
    be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.14.0-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your vino packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=897031#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-17 06:52:34 UTC  ``` semi embargoed via oCert / distros  Hello everybody,  the following public commits concerning some libvncserver issues have been reported to us by the reporter. CVE numbers have already been requested by the reporter and assigned for each issue.  A lot of Open Source products are probably affected, including x11vnc, KRFB/KRDC and VirtualBox, however it must be noted that all issues are post-authentication.  Considering that everything is public I merely wanted to forward privately the information we received, in the meantime I'll figure out what the reporter wants to do in terms of advisory and probably suggest that he takes this on oss-security.  Here are the individual issues (and later some further comments):  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/045a044e8ae79db9244593fbce154cdf6e843273> CVE-2014-6051  A malicious VNC server could advertise a very large screen size (by RFB protocol, width and height are 16-bit integers), resulting in an integer overflow during malloc() on client-side. Heap corruption, and possibly remote code execution on client-side could ensue.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/85a778c0e45e87e35ee7199f1f25020648e8b812> CVE-2014-6052  malloc() return value was not checked on client-side during framebuffer setup. A malicious VNC server that advertises a large enough screen size to make malloc() fail could basically map the framebuffer at address 0, and write anything-anywhere in client process memory using selective FramebufferUpdate messages. This could certainly turn into remote code execution on client-side. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/6037a9074d52b1963c97cb28ea1096c7c14cbf28>  A malicious client could advertise a very large ClientCutText message size (by RFB protocol, size is encoded on a 32-bit integer). malloc() is likely to fail in that case; as malloc() return value is not checked, this will most likely result in a server crash.  Note: this issue also affects RealVNC <http://www.iss.net/security_center/reference/vuln/VNC_Client_Cut_Text_DoS.htm> <http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/89160/RealVNC-VNC-Server-Free-Edition-4.1.3-Denial-Of-Service.html> Sending a ClientCutText Message with a length of 0xFFFFFFFF crashes the server  MITRE comments: Use CVE-2014-6053 for this libvncserver issue, which might also be interpreted as the server attempting to do normal processing of ClientCutText message sizes up to 2**32-1, even though clients that actually implement desktop sharing on a typical OS would not have more than 2**31-1 bytes of data available to send. (Even if this were not the case, CVE-2014-6053 could still be used for the mishandling of attempts at processing large values.)  The previously reported RealVNC issue is CVE-2010-5304.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/05a9bd41a8ec0a9d580a8f420f41718bdd235446> CVE-2014-6054.  A malicious client could set the scaling factor to 0, which will result in a server crash (division by zero).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/06ccdf016154fde8eccb5355613ba04c59127b2e>   The non-standard file transfer messages (UltraVNC feature) will blindly strcpy() client-provided file and directory names into a stack-based buffer of size MAX_PATH, resulting in multiple stack-based buffer overflows on server-side.  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/f528072216dec01cee7ca35d94e171a3b909e677>  Client-supplied FileTime attribute is copied into a stack-based buffer of size 64 during rfbFileTransferOffer message parsing, resulting in a stack-based buffer overflow on server-side.  MITRE comments: Use CVE-2014-6055 for all of the stack-based buffer overflows (we realize that the last one is in unrelated code).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Some further remarks from reporter:  * VNC server can be set to "security:none", which basically means no auth. This makes sense if VNC is connecting you to a login screen afterwards (e.g. x11vnc). In that configuration, all server-side bugs could be leveraged anonymously.  * Using VNC over an insecure network. Ok, this is not very security-wise in the first place. But if you are in a man-in-the-middle position, you can actually execute code on client-side or server-side, depending on the bug you trigger.  * Connecting to an untrusted VNC server and getting owned. For instance, if you connect to a VirtualBox client running some piece of malware which sets the screen resolution to 8192 x 8192 x 32bpp, then malloc() will fail and return NULL on client-side, basically mapping the framebuffer at address 0. Thereafter the VM screen content can overwrite selected parts of the client memory through partial updates, probably leading to client-side code execution.  * Some "Cloud" providers might actually provide their clients with VNC access to hosted instances. Being able to exploit the VNC server would actually mean evasion from the virtualization boundary (this would work for VirtualBox, at least. I am currently testing other virtualization software).  * Last but not least, some people are actually providing support to end-users through VNC. Not sure if the end-user expects support personnel to be able to run shellcode in the background.  --  Andrea Barisani |                Founder & Project Coordinator           oCERT | OSS Computer Security Incident Response Team  <lcars@ocert.org>                         <http://www.ocert.org>  0x864C9B9E 0A76 074A 02CD E989 CE7F AC3F DA47 578E 864C 9B9E         "Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate" ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=897031#c1)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-17 06:53:22 UTC  ``` will have to do a matrix of affectedness :/ ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=897031#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-09-17 22:00:20 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=897031#c3)  Marcus Meissner   2014-09-24 07:52:23 UTC  ``` published to oss-sec  From: Nicolas RUFF <nicolas.ruff@gmail.com> Date: Tue, 23 Sep 2014 23:47:05 +0200  Hello list,  I am currently reviewing libVNCserver for potential security issues.  Project home is: <https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver>  Here are my findings so far. Found bugs are either client- or server-side (libVNCserver provides both). All bugs require authentication. However they still pose a significant issue in the following scenarios: * VNC server is running in password-less mode because authentication is required afterwards (e.g. X11 login screen). * Attacker is located in a man-in-the-middle position. * Attacker has legitimate access to the VNC server but possibly not to the host server (e.g. virtual machine, remote assistance to a customer).  Fixes are being committed - a few of them are still pending in the pull request.  CVE-2014-6051 Integer overflow in MallocFrameBuffer() on client side.  A malicious VNC server could advertise a very large screen size (by RFB protocol, width and height are 16-bit integers), resulting in an integer overflow during malloc() on client-side. Heap corruption, and possibly remote code execution on client-side could ensue.  CVE-2014-6052 Lack of malloc() return value checking on client side.  malloc() return value was not checked on client-side during framebuffer setup. A malicious VNC server that advertises a large enough screen size to make malloc() fail could basically map the framebuffer at address 0, and write anything-anywhere in client process memory using selective FramebufferUpdate messages.

The LibVNCServer project, an open source library for implementing VNC compliant communication, suffers from a number of bugs that can be potentially exploited with security impact.  Various implementation issues resulting in remote code execution and/or DoS conditions on both the VNC server and client side have been discovered.   1. A malicious VNC server can trigger incorrect memory management     handling by advertising a large screen size parameter to the VNC     client. This would result in multiple memory corruptions and could     allow remote code execution on the VNC client.   2. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple DoS conditions on the VNC     server by advertising a large screen size, ClientCutText message     length and/or a zero scaling factor parameter.   3. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple stack-based buffer     overflows by passing a long file and directory names and/or attributes     (FileTime) when using the file transfer message feature.  It should be noted that every described issue represents a post-authentication bug, therefore the server side conditions can be anonymously leveraged only if the VNC server is configured to allow unauthenticated sessions.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-4587-1: iTALC vulnerabilities

20 October 2020

Several security issues were fixed in iTALC.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [italc](/security/cves?package=italc) - didact tool which allows teachers to view and control computer labs

## Details

Nicolas Ruff discovered that iTALC had buffer overflows, divide-by-zero errors

and didn't check malloc return values. A remote attacker could use these issues

to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-6051](/security/CVE-2014-6051), [CVE-2014-6052](/security/CVE-2014-6052), [CVE-2014-6053](/security/CVE-2014-6053), [CVE-2014-6054](/security/CVE-2014-6054), [CVE-2014-6055](/security/CVE-2014-6055))

Josef Gajdusek discovered that iTALC had heap-based buffer overflow

vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could used these issues to cause a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9941](/security/CVE-2016-9941), [CVE-2016-9942](/security/CVE-2016-9942))

It was discovered that iTALC had an out-of-bounds write, multiple heap

out-of-bounds writes, an infinite loop, improper initializations, and null

pointer vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could used these issues to cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-15127](/security/CVE-2018-15127),

[CVE-2018-20019](/security/CVE-2018-20019), [CVE-2018-20020](/security/CVE-2018-20020), [CVE-2018-20021](/security/CVE-2018-20021), [CVE-2018-20022](/security/CVE-2018-20022), [CVE-2018-20023](/security/CVE-2018-20023),

[CVE-2018-20024](/security/CVE-2018-20024), [CVE-2018-20748](/security/CVE-2018-20748), [CVE-2018-20749](/security/CVE-2018-20749), [CVE-2018-20750](/security/CVE-2018-20750), [CVE-2018-7225](/security/CVE-2018-7225),

[CVE-2019-15681](/security/CVE-2019-15681))

  [1:2.0.2+dfsg1-4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc/1%3A2.0.2%2Bdfsg1-4ubuntu0.1)
* [italc-master](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc)
  -
  [1:2.0.2+dfsg1-4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc/1%3A2.0.2%2Bdfsg1-4ubuntu0.1)
* [libitalccore](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc)
  -
  [1:2.0.2+dfsg1-4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc/1%3A2.0.2%2Bdfsg1-4ubuntu0.1)
