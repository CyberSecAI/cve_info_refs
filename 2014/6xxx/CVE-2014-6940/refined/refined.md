The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6940.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Applications do not verify that the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can intercept, view, or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
*   Potential for credential theft.
*   Possibility of arbitrary code execution.
* The specific impact varies based on the functionality of the vulnerable application.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker must be on the same network as the Android device.
*   Attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic.
