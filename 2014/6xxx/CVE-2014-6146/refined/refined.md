Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `cdinterop_cdjava.log` file was inadvertently logging the content of transferred files after migrating to Sterling B2B Integrator V5.2.4, Fix Pack 2. Specifically, the data was being logged after the string 'ACdCopier.doStripBlanks():'.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The primary weakness is the logging of sensitive data within the `cdinterop_cdjava.log` files. This log file is intended for debugging and operational purposes, but it was inadvertently capturing the contents of transferred files, which could include confidential information.
*   **Logging Configuration Bypass:** The configuration settings within `cdinterop-log.properties` intended to control the logging behavior (specifically disabling sensitive data logging) were not functioning as expected, leading to the exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** The exposure of transferred file content in the log files could lead to a breach of confidentiality if an unauthorized party gains access to these logs. This is especially critical as the files being transferred could contain highly sensitive data, such as financial information, personally identifiable information (PII), or other proprietary business data.
*   **Audit Issues:** The customer requires logging to be enabled for auditing purposes, so disabling logging to avoid the vulnerability is not an acceptable workaround.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log File Access:** An attacker with access to the server where the Sterling B2B Integrator is running, specifically to the directory where the `cdinterop_cdjava.log` files are stored, could exploit this vulnerability.
*  **Internal User Access:** A malicious or compromised internal user or administrator with access to the log files could view the content of transferred files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Server:** The attacker must have access to the file system where the Sterling B2B Integrator is installed to access the `cdinterop_cdjava.log` files. This could be direct server access, compromised credentials or through some vulnerability allowing file access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was resolved in versions `5020402_4` and `5020500`.
*   The problem was introduced after migrating to Sterling B2B Integrator V5.2.4, Fix Pack 2.
*   The circumvention suggested was to turn off the Sterling Connect Direct Server Adapter Protocol logging, but this was not a viable workaround as the customer required logging to be enabled.
