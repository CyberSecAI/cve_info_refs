## Error description

* ```
  Customer is observing content of the transferred file visible in
  the cdinterop_cdjava.log. In the log file
  cdinterop_cdjava.log.D20140831.zip, everything after
  'ACdCopier.doStripBlanks():' is content of the transferred file.
  It should be possible to control the log setting from the
  cdinterop-log.properties, however this does not work - the
  issue is there in spite of the fact that all parameters in
  cdinterop-log.properties are set to NO.

  ```

## Local fix
