Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from IBM Maximo Asset Management's improper handling of user logouts. When a user closes a Maximo session, the application fails to fully terminate the associated Cognos BI session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Session Management:** The primary weakness is the inadequate session termination, leading to the persistence of a Cognos BI session even after the corresponding Maximo session is closed. This allows a subsequent local user to potentially access the previous user's Cognos BI data without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** A local user can bypass security controls and access the previous user's Cognos BI data, potentially leading to information disclosure or unauthorized actions within the Cognos BI environment.
*   **Data Breach:** The vulnerability could be exploited to view or manipulate sensitive information managed within Cognos BI.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires a local user (i.e., someone with physical or local network access to the same machine where Maximo is running).
*   **Session Persistence:** The attacker relies on the previous user's session not being properly terminated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have local access to the machine/system where Maximo is running.
*   They need to have a valid user account on the system.
*   The attacker needs to attempt to access Cognos BI after another user's Maximo session has been closed but before the Cognos session times out or is manually terminated.
