How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in Bash affect IBM PureApplication System (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Six Bash vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014. This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock” and two memory corruption vulnerabilities. Bash is used by IBM PureApplication System.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID**: [CVE-2014-6271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

## Affected Products and Versions

* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.0 and later fix packs
* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.1 and later fix packs
* IBM PureApplication System Version 2.0 and later fix packs

## Remediation/Fixes

The solution is to apply the fixes with the following direction:

**PureSystems Managers:**

The PureSystems Managers on all IBM PureApplication System versions are affected. Upgrade the IBM PureApplication System to the following interim Fix (iFix) levels:

* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.0 and later fix packs:

+ Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V1.0.0.4 iFix 9

* IBM PureApplication System Version 1.1 and later fix packs:

+ Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V1.1.0.4 iFix 4

* IBM PureApplication System Version 2.0 and later fix packs:

+ Upgrade to IBM PureApplication System V2.0.0.0 iFix 2

**Deployed Virtual Machines:**

Deployed AIX virtual machines are not affected. Upgrade all deployed Red Hat Linux virtual machines by using an emergency fix (eFix) provided by IBM:

* Download the eFix from IBM Fix Central (see the following link):

<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?product=ibm/WebSphere/PureApplication+System&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=RedHat_Image_Bash_Vulnerability&includeSupersedes=0>

* Import the eFix into the IBM PureApplication System Emergency Fix catalog.

* Apply this Emergency Fix on each deployed Red Hat Linux virtual machine. Bash is upgraded to version bash-4.1.2-15.e16\_5.2.

**Images:**

For images, you can use the new default image, or you can extend and capture the existing image by using the following general procedure:

* Import the eFix into the IBM Workload Deployer Emergency Fix catalog.

* From the image catalog, select the image and click "Extend."

* After the image extend operation completes succcessfully, click Service from the deployed virtual machine.

* Apply this emergency fix.

* From the image catalog, capture the image.

Use this newly captured image for future deployment.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The vulnerability is related to the way in which shell functions are passed though environment variables. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject commands into a Bash shell, depending on how the shell is invoked. The Bash shell may be invoked by a number of processes including, but not limited to, telnet, SSH, DHCP, and scripts hosted on web servers. All versions of GNU Bash starting with version 1.14 are affected by this vulnerability and the specific impact is determined by the characteristics of the process using the Bash shell. In the worst case, an unauthenticated remote attacker would be able to execute commands on an affected server. However, in most cases involving Cisco products, authentication is required before exploitation could be attempted.  Affected Products  * Cisco is currently investigating it's product line to determine which products may be affected and the extent of the impact of the vulnerability on it's products. Additional Cisco products will be added as the investigation progresses.       **The following Cisco products are currently under investigation**      *None*   Vulnerable ProductsCustomers interested in tracking the progress of any of the following bugs can visit the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool") to view the defect details and optionally select *Save Bug* and activate the *Email Notification* feature to receive automatic notifications when the bug is updated.

bash shell allows shell variables and functions to be exported to a child from its parent through the process environment. Function definitions are passed using environment variables that share the name of the function and start with `() {`.       The child bash process does not stop processing and executing code after processing the closing brace `}` which is passed in the function definition. An attacker could define a function variable such as: `FUNCT=() { ignored; }; /bin/id` to execute **/bin/id** when the environment is imported into the child process.       The impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product because some attack vectors such as SSH, require successful authentication to be exploited and may not result in any additional privileges granted to the user.      This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278.      Several software tools have been created to help administrators identify if the version of Bash running on their platforms has been fixed. Several of these tools provide false positive results or crash the Bash shell. The information provided for each bug ID in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool") identifies the versions of software that contain the fixed code and should be used to determine if a product is vulnerable.  Workarounds  * There are no mitigations for this vulnerability that can be performed directly on affected systems. However, the following network based mitigations may be of use to some customers.   + Cisco Intrusion Protection System (IPS) signature 4689-0 has been created and is available in release S824   + Cisco Sourcefire has published Snort signatures 31975-31977, 31985, 32038-32039, 32041-32043, 32045-32047, and 32049 to detect and protect networks against the Bash vulnerabilityCisco has published an Event Response for this vulnerability:   <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_Bash_09252014.html>       Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=35836>  Fixed Software  * Cisco will be providing software upgrades for vulnerable products.

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

### [Bash bug: apply Florian's patch now (CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html)

OK, rebuild bash and deploy [Florian's unofficial patch](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) or its [now-upstream version](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027) now. If you're a distro maintainer, please consider doing the same.My [previous post](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html) has more information about the original vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271). It also explains Tavis' and my original negative sentiment toward the [original upstream patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-025). In short, the revised code did not stop bash from parsing the code seen in potentially attacker-controlled, remotely-originating environmental variables. Instead, the fix simply seeks to harden the parsing to prevent RCE. It relies on two risky assumptions:

* That spare for this one bug we're fixing now, the process of parsing attacker-controlled functions is guaranteed to have no side effects on the subsequently executed trusted code.* That the underlying parser, despite probably not being designed to deal with attacker-supplied inputs, is free from the usual range of C language bugs.

From the very early hours, we have argued on the [oss-security mailing list](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/663) that a more reasonable approach would be to shield the parser from remotely-originating strings. I proposed putting the function export functionality behind a runtime flag or using a separate, prefixed namespace for the exported functions - so that variables such as `HTTP_COOKIE` do not go through this code path at all. Unfortunately, we made no real progress on that early in the game.Soon thereafter, people started to bump into additional problems in the parser code. The first assumption behind the patch - the one about the parsing process not having other side effects - was quickly proved wrong by [Tavis](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/514887394294652929), who came up with a code construct that would get the parser in an inconsistent state, causing bash to create a bogus file and mangle any subsequent code that `/bin/sh` is supposed to execute.This was assigned CVE-2014-7169 and led to a round of high-profile press reports claiming that we're still doomed, and people assigning the new bug [CVSS scores all the way up to 11](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-7169). The reality was a bit more nuanced: the glitch demonstrated by Tavis' code is a bit less concerning, because it does not translate into a universally exploitable RCE - at least not as far as we could figure it out. Some uses of `/bin/sh` would be at risk, but most would just break in a probably-non-exploitable way. The maintainer followed with [another patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-026) that locked down this specific hole.The second assumption started showing cracks, too. First came a report from Todd Sabin, who identified an [static array overflow error](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/32) when parsing more than ten stacked redirects. The bug, assigned CVE-2014-7186, would cause a crash, but given the nature of the underlying assignment, immediate exploitability seemed fairly unlikely. Another probably non-security off-by-one issue with line counting in loops cropped up shortly thereafter (CVE-2014-7187).The two latter issues do not have an officially released upstream patch at that point, but they prompted Florian Weimer of Red Hat to develop an unofficial patch that takes a seemingly more durable approach that we argued for earlier on: [putting function exports in a separate namespace](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13). Florian's fix effectively isolates the function parsing code from attacker-controlled strings in almost all the important use cases we can currently think of.(One major outlier would be any solutions that rely on blacklisting environmental variables to run restricted shells or restricted commands as a privileged user - sudo-type stuff - but it's a much smaller attack surface and a a very dubious security boundary to begin with.)Well... so, to get to the point: I've been fuzzing the underlying function parser on the side - and yesterday, bumped into a new parsing issue (CVE-2014-6277) that is almost certainly remotely exploitable and made easier to leverage due to the fact that bash is [seldom compiled with ASLR](https://twitter.com/scarybeasts/status/515774894718459904). I'll share the technical details later on; for now, I sent the info to the maintainer of bash and to several key Linux distros. In general terms, it's an attempt to access uninitialized memory leading to reads from, and then subsequent writes to, a pointer that is fully within attacker's control. Here's a pretty telling crash:
bash[3054]: segfault at 41414141 ip 00190d96 ...

Soon after posting this entry, I also bumped in the sixth and most severe issue so far, essentially permitting very simple and straightforward remote code execution (CVE-2014-6278) on the systems that are patched against the first bug. It's a "put your commands here" type of a bug similar to the original report. I will post additional details in a couple of days to give people enough time to upgrade.At this point, I **very strongly** recommend manually deploying [Florian's patch](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) unless your distro is already shipping it. (Florian's patch has been also finally included [upstream](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html) shortly after I first posted this entry.)From within the shell itself, the simplest way to check if you already have it installed would be:
\_x='() { echo vulnerable; }' bash -c '\_x 2>/dev/null || echo not vulnerable'

If the command shows "vulnerable", you don't have the patch and you are still vulnerable to a (currently non-public) RCE, even if you applied the original one (or the subsequent upstream patch that addressed the issue found by Tavis).

   "The patch should apply cleanly to bash 4.2, but requires one minor tweak for 4.3." I'm trying to apply it to 4.3.25(1), what's the "one minor tweak" that you're referring to?

     One chunk in variables.c will fail because of few extra lines around:

      report\_error (\_("error importing function definition for `%s'"), name);

     In essence, you should reconcile what ends up in variables.c.rej manually. Most of it should be obvious. The "Restore the original suffix." part from the patch should go right after the first closing curly bracket underneath the existing "error importing function definition" bit.

     ie.

      {
      if (temp\_var = bind\_variable (name, string, 0))
      {
      VSETATTR (temp\_var, (att\_exported | att\_imported | att\_invisible));

      /\* Restore the original suffix. \*/
      temp\_name[name\_length] = FUNCDEF\_SUFFIX[0];
     ...right?

   These "toughten the feature" patches still feel quite scary.

   Since the feature seem to be so rarely used, how come it isn't off by default already ? Enable it via some ENV var or shopt (bonus point if you can restrict it to specific variable names), and let people who need it take the necessary security steps.

   I have a question. When my bash is vulnerable to CVE-2014-6278, How do i check this vulnerablity?? Is the same the result of CVE-2014-6277???

     There's only one patch, addressing both. The test case provided at the bottom of the blog post tests for the presence of this patch.

     Sigh, this Google thing actually screwed my previous comment: The first part (vulnerable) output is with GNU bash, version 4.3.28(1)-release (powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu)

     Are the tests at https://github.com/hannob/bashcheck/blob/master/bashcheck actually valid?

     They are probably OK, although I certainly haven't tested on ARM. But for most part, just get Florian's patch and be done with it, there's little value in testing for individual issues.

     But it's already applied! Better said, the upstream one: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027 ; also the today's 028 patch is applied. Why's the thing \*still\* segfaulting on PowerPC and not ARM or x86/amd64?

   Thanks for watching our backs and catching the bash s/w defect. Can you post some more tests here to help us evaluate whether our bash is vulnerable?

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

---

### [SUSE information](https://www.suse.com/c/cve-pages-self-help-security-issues-suse-linux-enterprise/)

Overall state of this security issue: Resolved

This issue is currently rated as having [critical](https://www.suse.com/support/security/rating/) severity.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

## ShellShock

# ShellShock 101 - What you need to know and do, to ensure your systems are secure

#### What is the ShellShock vulnerability and how do I know it exists on my systems?

A new vulnerability has been found that potentially affects Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X operating systems. First disclosed on September 24, 2014 and commonly known as the “Bash Bug” or “ShellShock”, the GNU Bash Remote Code Execution Vulnerability ([CVE-2014-6271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271) and [CVE-2014-7169](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169)) could allow attackers to gain control over a targeted computer if exploited successfully, giving them access to your data and networks.

The vulnerability leverages the Bash shell, a command language interpreter. An attacker can attach malicious code to environment variables that affect the way processes are run on a computer.

If you are using versions of Bash in operating systems based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 9, 10 or 11, your servers are potentially at risk. If your systems are affected, we recommend that you patch your systems right away.

[SUSE Manager](/products/suse-manager/) can also be used to verify the status of your systems, and apply the ShellShock patches if necessary. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOvGe0VyNiM&list=UUbkuT_ABdCbrTIrQqzVeXcg) to see how quick and easy it is to verify, patch and audit your systems with SUSE Manager.

#### Is a patch available for me if I have current subscriptions and am running the most current version of SUSE Linux Enterprise 9, 10 or 11? What if I'm running earlier versions and have subscribed to Long Term Service Pack Support?

Yes and yes. There are two patches that close this vulnerability that you can access and apply, if you are a current customer with active support subscriptions, or a current customer with active support subscriptions and Long Term Service Pack Support (LTSS).

These patches are available through SUSE maintenance channels for your particular operating system. Instructions for how to get access to these patches and update your systems is available through [SUSE Update Advisories](/support/update/). Additional information about the process is available through this [SUSE Knowledgebase entry](/support/kb/doc?id=7015702).

#### What if I'm a current customer but I'm using older operating systems for some of my servers without a support contract like Long Term Service Pack Support for those older versions? Can I still get the patches?

Yes. Our primary concern and first priority is to make sure that your systems are secure.

Given the widespread use of Bash and its inclusion in multiple generations of our operating system products, we consider this to be an extraordinary circumstance. We want to make sure that all of your systems are protected, even those that you may have inadvertently chosen to run in an unsupported fashion.

In order to get access to these patches, we've created a special entitlement for you. Please go to our [patch finder](https://scc.suse.com/patches/) site to access and download the patches that you need. Alternatively, you can notify your local contact at our [global technical support organization](/support/). Once they have confirmed that you are a current customer with active support subscriptions, they will help you open a service request and provide you with instructions on how to access the security patches for your earlier, unsupported operating systems.

#### What if I'm using SUSE Linux Enterprise-based operating systems offered by public cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services? Do I need to patch those systems?

If you initiated service on or after Saturday, September 27, at 2 PM EDT, then your systems have already been patched and are secure. If your services were started prior to that date, your systems are potentially at risk. In order to ensure that your systems are secure, we recommend that you restart your services on secure systems, or patch your existing systems following the instructions described in the [SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, AWS Updates & ShellShock blog](/c/blog/suse-linux-enterprise-server-aws-updates-shellshock/).

#### What does the patch address or not address? Do I need to do anything else after applying the patch to make sure I'm no longer vulnerable?

Applying the two patches eliminates the ability to append the Bash environmental variables with malicious code. After applying the patches, there are no additional tasks required to ensure you are no longer vulnerable.

SUSE works around the clock to fix known security issues that impact its supported products. When we become aware of an issue and a patch is created, we provide this information to our customers through security updates. As a general rule, we recommend that you watch for these updates and apply any patches that are critical to keeping your systems secure.

Customers can choose to be notified daily or weekly, via email or RSS, about just security updates, or all of the updates that are available for their systems. Go to our [patch finder](https://scc.suse.com/patches/) page for more information about how you can subscribe to proactive notifications.

#### After first hearing about this ShellShock vulnerability, I've since heard about other related security issues. Are there additional issues, and does it affect my systems?

There have been additional disclosures about related security vulnerabilities involving the Bash shell, but your SUSE Linux Enterprise-based systems are not impacted if they have recently been patched. The patches provided for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169 also take care of these new issues. [CVE-2014-6277](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6277) and [CVE-2014-6278](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278) describe these new issues in greater detail. More information is also available at this [knowledgebase entry](/support/kb/doc?id=7015714).

#### What's the best way to make sure I always receive security updates for all my SUSE Linux Enterprise-based systems as quickly as possible?

The best way is to ensure that you have active subscriptions for all your systems and are running current versions that are within their support life cycle. If you need to run an older version that is out of its standard life cycle, you should purchase extended life cycle support, such as our LTSS offering. For more information on purchasing subscriptions and LTSS, contact your SUSE sales representative or partner.

### [Bash bug: the other two RCEs, or how we chipped away at the original fix (CVE-2014-6277 and '78)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/bash-bug-how-we-finally-cracked.html)

The patch that implements a prefix-based way to mitigate vulnerabilities in bash function exports has been [out since last week](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) and has been already picked up by most Linux vendors (plus by Apple). So, here's a quick overview of the key developments along the way, including two really interesting things: proof-of-concept test cases for two serious, previously non-public RCE bugs tracked as CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278.***NOTE: If you or your distro maintainers have already deployed Florian's patch, there is no reason for alarm - you are almost certainly not vulnerable to attacks. If you do not have this patch, and instead relied only on the original CVE-2014-6271 fix, you probably need to act now. See [this entry](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html) for a convenient test case and other tips.***Still here? Good. If you need a refresher, the basic principles of the underlying function export functionality, and the impact of the original bash bug (CVE-2014-6271), are discussed in [this blog post](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html). If you have read the earlier post, the original attack disclosed by Stephane Chazelas should be very easy to understand:`HTTP_COOKIE='() { 0; }; echo hi mom;' bash -c :`In essence, the internal parser invoked by bash to process the specially encoded function definitions passed around in environmental variables had a small problem: it continued parsing the code past the end of the function definition itself - and at that point, flat out executed whatever instructions it came across, just as it would do in a normal bash script. Given that the value of certain environmental variables can be controlled by remote attackers in quite a few common settings, this opened up a good chunk of the Internet to attacks.The original vulnerability was reported privately and kept under embargo for roughly two weeks to develop a fairly conservative fix that modified the parser to bail out in a timely manner and do not parse any trailing commands. As soon as the embargo was lifted, we all found out about the bug and scrambled to deploy fixes. At the same time, a good chunk of the security community reacted with surprise and disbelief that bash is keen to dispatch the contents of environmental variables to a fairly complex syntax parser - so we started poking around.Tavis was the quickest: he found that you can convince the parser to keep looking for a file name for output redirection past the boundary between the untrusted string accepted from the environment and the actual body of the program that bash is being asked to execute (CVE-2014-7169). His original test case can be simplified at:`HTTP_COOKIE='() { function a a>\' bash -c echo`This example would create an empty file named "echo", instead of executing the requested command. Tavis' finding meant that you would be at risk of remote code execution in situations where attacker-controlled environmental variables are mixed with sanitized, attacker-controlled command-line parameters passed to calls such as `system()` or `popen()`. For example, you'd be in trouble if you were doing this in a web app:`system("echo '"+ sanitized_string_without_quotes + "' | /some/trusted/program");`...because the attacker could convince bash to skip over the "echo" command and execute the command given in the second parameter, which happens to be a sanitized string (albeit probably with no ability to specify parameters). On the flip side, this is a fairly specific if not entirely exotic coding pattern - and contrary to some of the initial reports, the bug probably wasn't exploitable in a much more general way.Chet, the maintainer of bash, started working on a fix to close this specific parsing issue, and released it [soon thereafter](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-026).On the same day, Todd Sabin and Florian Weimer have independently bumped into a static array overflow in the parser (CVE-2014-7186). The bug manifested in what seemed to be a non-exploitable crash, trying to dereference a non-attacker-controlled pointer at an address that "by design" should fall well above the end of heap - but was enough to cast even more doubt on the robustness of the underlying code. The test for this problem was pretty simple - you just needed a sequence of here-documents that overflowed a static array, say:`HTTP_COOKIE='() { 0 <<a <<b <<c <<d <<e <<f <<g <<h <<i <<j <<k <<l <<m; }' bash -c :`Florian also bumped into an off-by-one issue with loop parsing (CVE-2014-7187); the proof-of-concept function definition for this is a trivial `for` loop nested 129 levels deep, but the effect can be only observed under memory access diagnostics tools, and its practical significance is probably low. Nevertheless, all these revelations prompted him to start working on an unofficial but far more comprehensive patch that would largely shield the parser from untrusted strings in normally encountered variables present in the environment.In parallel to Tavis' and Florian's work, I set up a very straightforward fuzzing job with [american fuzzy lop](https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop/). I seeded it with a rudimentary function definition:
() { foo() { foo; }; >bar; }

...and simply let it run with a minimalistic wrapper that took the test case generated by the fuzzer, put it in a variable, and then called `execve()` to invoke bash.Although the fuzzer had no clue about the syntax of shell programs, it had the benefit of being able to identify and isolate interesting syntax based on coverage signals, deriving around 1,000 other distinctive test cases from the starting one while "instinctively" knowing not to mess with the essential "() {" prefix. For the first few hours, it kept hitting only the redirect issue originally reported by Todd and the file-creation issue discovered by Tavis - but soon thereafter, it spewed out a new crash illustrated by this snippet of code (**CVE-2014-6277**):`HTTP_COOKIE='() { x() { _; }; x() { _; } <<a; }' bash -c :`This proved to be a very straightforward use of uninitialized memory: it hit a code path in `make_redirect()` where one field in a newly-allocated `REDIR` struct - `here_doc_eof` - would not be set to any specific value, yet would be treated as a valid pointer later on (somewhere in `copy_redirect()`).Now, if bash is compiled with both `--enable-bash-malloc` and `--enable-mem-scramble`, the memory returned to `make_redirect()` by `xmalloc()` will be set to `0xdf`, making the pointer always resolve to `0xdfdfdfdf`, and thus rendering the prospect of exploitation far more speculative (essentially depending on whether the stack or any other memory region can be grown by the attacker to overlap with this address). That said, on a good majority of Linux distros, these flags are disabled, and you can trivially get bash to dereference a pointer that is entirely within attacker's control:`HTTP_COOKIE="() { x() { _; }; x() { _; } <<`perl -e '{print "A"x1000}'`; }" bash -c :

bash[25662]: segfault at 41414141 ip 00190d96 sp bfbe6354 error 4 in libc-2.12.so[110000+191000]`The actual fault happens because of an attempt to copy `here_doc_eof` to a newly-allocated buffer using a C macro that expands to the following code:`strcpy(xmalloc(1 + strlen(redirect->here_doc_eof)), (redirect->here_doc_eof))`This appears to be exploitable in at least one way: if `here_doc_eof` is chosen by the attacker to point in the vicinity of the current stack pointer, the apparent contents of the string - and therefore its length - may change between stack-based calls to `xmalloc()` and `strcpy()` as a natural consequence of an attempt to pass parameters and create local variables. Such a mid-macro switch will result in an out-of-bounds write to the newly-allocated memory.A simple conceptual illustration of this attack vector would be:
char\* result;
int len\_alloced;
main(int argc, char\*\* argv) {
/\* The offset will be system- and compiler-specific \*/;
char\* ptr = &ptr - 9;
result = strcpy (malloc(100 + (len\_alloced = strlen(ptr))), ptr);
printf("requested memory = %d\n"
"copied text = %d\n", len\_alloced + 1, strlen(result) + 1);
}

When compiled with the -O2 flag used for bash, on one test system, this produces:`requested memory = 2

copied text = 28`Of course, the result will vary from system to system, but the general consequences of this should be fairly evident. The issue is also made worse by the fact that only relatively few distributions were building bash as a position-independent executable that could be fully protected by ASLR.(In addition to this vector, there is also a location in `dispose_cmd.c` that calls `free()` on the pointer under some circumstances, but I haven't really really spent a lot of time trying to develop a functioning exploit for the '77 bug for reasons that should be evident in the text that follows... well, just about now.)It has to be said that there is a bit less glamour to such a low-level issue that still requires you to go through some mental gymnastics to be exploited in a portable way. Luckily, the fuzzer kept going, and few hours later, isolated a test case that, after [minimization](http://code.google.com/p/tmin/), yielded this gem (**CVE-2014-6278**):`HTTP_COOKIE='() { _; } >_[$($())] { echo hi mom; id; }' bash -c :`I am... actually not entirely sure what happens here. A sequence of nested `$...` statements within a redirect appears to cause the parser to bail out without properly resetting its state, and puts it in the mood for executing whatever comes next. The test case works as-is with bash 4.2 and 4.3, but not with more ancient releases; this is probably related to changes introduced few years ago in bash 4.2 patch level 12 (`xparse_dolparen()`), but I have not investigated if earlier versions are patently not vulnerable or simply require different syntax.The CVE-2014-6278 payload allows straightforward "put-your-commands-here" remote code execution on systems that are protected only with the original patch - something that we were [worried about](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html) for a while, and what prompted us to [ask people to update again](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2688932/improved-patch-tackles-new-shellshock-attack-vectors.html) over the past few days.Well, that's it. I kept the technical details of the last two findings embargoed for a while to give people some time to incorporate Florian's patch and avoid the panic associated with the original bug - but at this point, given the scrutiny that the code is under, the ease of discovering the problems with off-the-shelf open-source tools, and the availability of adequate mitigations, the secrecy seems to have outlived its purpose.Any closing thoughts? Well, I'm not sure there's a particular lesson to be learnt from the entire story. There's perhaps one thing - it would probably have been helpful if the questionable nature of the original patch was spotted by any of the notified vendors during the two-week embargo period. That said, I wasn't privy to these conversations - and hindsight is always 20/20.

   Can you make any comment as to where 4.3 u28 fits into this whole situation? I was under the impression from previous comments here (and elsewhere) that 4.3 u27, posted by Chet this past Saturday after the various redhat updates, resolved all six of the currently-known Bash CVEs (including CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187.) As such, I am surprised to see 4.3 u28 being released, especially with no accompanying updates from redhat since the 26th. Just trying to figure out how 4.3 u28 fits in and whether it specifically addresses any CVEs, since I had (perhaps incorrectly) surmised that 4.3 u27 resolved/mitigated these various CVEs being discussed.

   4.3.27 does not resolve all known issues, but adopts Florian's mitigation that shields the parser from untrusted inputs in normal use cases. The subsequent patch (28) actually eliminates CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187, but with patch 27 in place, they do not pose a security risk. Two more to go, probably in patch 29.

     Thanks Michal! I assume that when you refer to Bash needing to update to resolve two more CVEs, you are referring to CVE-2014-6277 and 6278, correct?

     Bash 4.3.29 released on 10.2, I think this can resolve all of 6 issues, hope I am right

     Exactly. The lesson here, for me, is that I'm not getting enough bang-for-the-buck out of bash to warrant the security risks. I'll simply uninstall it from my systems.

   Hello everyone, just a quick question...

   My impression is that scanning applies to known vulnerabilities, fuzzing is for discovering new ones, and the term "testing" can apply to both. Is that correct?

RESOLUTION

HP has released the following software updates to resolve the vulnerability
in HP StoreFabric B-series switches running Bash Shell.

  Note: HP and the switch vendor recommend running an active version of
Fabric OS (FOS) listed on the HP Single Point of Connectivity Knowledge
(SPOCK) website ( <http://h20272.www2.hp.com/> ) and applying the work-around
information provided in the MITIGATION INFORMATION section below to protect
HP StoreFabric B-series switches from this vulnerability.

  Fabric OS (FOS) v7.3.0b (This version will be available soon and this
bulletin will revised at that time)

  The following focused fix FOS versions are available for the previously
released versions and have been renamed to include an additional hexadecimal
character appended to the FOS version on which it is based:

    FOS v7.2.1c1
    FOS v7.2.0d6
    FOS v7.1.2b1
    FOS v7.1.1c1
    FOS v7.1.0cb
    FOS v7.0.2e1
    FOS v7.0.0d1
    FOS v6.4.3f3
    FOS v6.4.2a3
    FOS v6.2.2f9

MITIGATION INFORMATION

  HP recommends the following steps to reduce the risk of this vulnerability:

    - Place the HP StoreFabric SAN switch and other data center critical
infrastructure behind a firewall to disallow access from the Internet.
    - Change all HP StoreFabric switch default account passwords, including
the root passwords, from the default factory passwords.
    - Examine the list of accounts, including ones on the switch and those
existing on remote authentication servers such as RADIUS, LDAP, and TACAS+,
to ensure only necessary personnel can gain access to HP StoreFabric FOS
switches. Delete guest accounts and temporary accounts created for one-time
usage needs.
    - Utilize FOS password policy management to strengthen the complexity,
age, and history requirements of switch account passwords.

### [Bash bug: apply Florian's patch now (CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html)

OK, rebuild bash and deploy [Florian's unofficial patch](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) or its [now-upstream version](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027) now. If you're a distro maintainer, please consider doing the same.My [previous post](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html) has more information about the original vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271). It also explains Tavis' and my original negative sentiment toward the [original upstream patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-025). In short, the revised code did not stop bash from parsing the code seen in potentially attacker-controlled, remotely-originating environmental variables. Instead, the fix simply seeks to harden the parsing to prevent RCE. It relies on two risky assumptions:

* That spare for this one bug we're fixing now, the process of parsing attacker-controlled functions is guaranteed to have no side effects on the subsequently executed trusted code.* That the underlying parser, despite probably not being designed to deal with attacker-supplied inputs, is free from the usual range of C language bugs.

From the very early hours, we have argued on the [oss-security mailing list](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/663) that a more reasonable approach would be to shield the parser from remotely-originating strings. I proposed putting the function export functionality behind a runtime flag or using a separate, prefixed namespace for the exported functions - so that variables such as `HTTP_COOKIE` do not go through this code path at all. Unfortunately, we made no real progress on that early in the game.Soon thereafter, people started to bump into additional problems in the parser code. The first assumption behind the patch - the one about the parsing process not having other side effects - was quickly proved wrong by [Tavis](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/514887394294652929), who came up with a code construct that would get the parser in an inconsistent state, causing bash to create a bogus file and mangle any subsequent code that `/bin/sh` is supposed to execute.This was assigned CVE-2014-7169 and led to a round of high-profile press reports claiming that we're still doomed, and people assigning the new bug [CVSS scores all the way up to 11](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-7169). The reality was a bit more nuanced: the glitch demonstrated by Tavis' code is a bit less concerning, because it does not translate into a universally exploitable RCE - at least not as far as we could figure it out. Some uses of `/bin/sh` would be at risk, but most would just break in a probably-non-exploitable way. The maintainer followed with [another patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-026) that locked down this specific hole.The second assumption started showing cracks, too. First came a report from Todd Sabin, who identified an [static array overflow error](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/32) when parsing more than ten stacked redirects. The bug, assigned CVE-2014-7186, would cause a crash, but given the nature of the underlying assignment, immediate exploitability seemed fairly unlikely. Another probably non-security off-by-one issue with line counting in loops cropped up shortly thereafter (CVE-2014-7187).The two latter issues do not have an officially released upstream patch at that point, but they prompted Florian Weimer of Red Hat to develop an unofficial patch that takes a seemingly more durable approach that we argued for earlier on: [putting function exports in a separate namespace](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13). Florian's fix effectively isolates the function parsing code from attacker-controlled strings in almost all the important use cases we can currently think of.(One major outlier would be any solutions that rely on blacklisting environmental variables to run restricted shells or restricted commands as a privileged user - sudo-type stuff - but it's a much smaller attack surface and a a very dubious security boundary to begin with.)Well... so, to get to the point: I've been fuzzing the underlying function parser on the side - and yesterday, bumped into a new parsing issue (CVE-2014-6277) that is almost certainly remotely exploitable and made easier to leverage due to the fact that bash is [seldom compiled with ASLR](https://twitter.com/scarybeasts/status/515774894718459904). I'll share the technical details later on; for now, I sent the info to the maintainer of bash and to several key Linux distros. In general terms, it's an attempt to access uninitialized memory leading to reads from, and then subsequent writes to, a pointer that is fully within attacker's control. Here's a pretty telling crash:
bash[3054]: segfault at 41414141 ip 00190d96 ...

Soon after posting this entry, I also bumped in the sixth and most severe issue so far, essentially permitting very simple and straightforward remote code execution (CVE-2014-6278) on the systems that are patched against the first bug. It's a "put your commands here" type of a bug similar to the original report. I will post additional details in a couple of days to give people enough time to upgrade.At this point, I **very strongly** recommend manually deploying [Florian's patch](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) unless your distro is already shipping it. (Florian's patch has been also finally included [upstream](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html) shortly after I first posted this entry.)From within the shell itself, the simplest way to check if you already have it installed would be:
\_x='() { echo vulnerable; }' bash -c '\_x 2>/dev/null || echo not vulnerable'

If the command shows "vulnerable", you don't have the patch and you are still vulnerable to a (currently non-public) RCE, even if you applied the original one (or the subsequent upstream patch that addressed the issue found by Tavis).

   "The patch should apply cleanly to bash 4.2, but requires one minor tweak for 4.3." I'm trying to apply it to 4.3.25(1), what's the "one minor tweak" that you're referring to?

     One chunk in variables.c will fail because of few extra lines around:

      report\_error (\_("error importing function definition for `%s'"), name);

     In essence, you should reconcile what ends up in variables.c.rej manually. Most of it should be obvious. The "Restore the original suffix." part from the patch should go right after the first closing curly bracket underneath the existing "error importing function definition" bit.

     ie.

      {
      if (temp\_var = bind\_variable (name, string, 0))
      {
      VSETATTR (temp\_var, (att\_exported | att\_imported | att\_invisible));

      }

      /\* Restore the original suffix. \*/
      temp\_name[name\_length] = FUNCDEF\_SUFFIX[0];
     ...right?

   These "toughten the feature" patches still feel quite scary.

   Since the feature seem to be so rarely used, how come it isn't off by default already ? Enable it via some ENV var or shopt (bonus point if you can restrict it to specific variable names), and let people who need it take the necessary security steps.

     There's only one patch, addressing both. The test case provided at the bottom of the blog post tests for the presence of this patch.

     Sigh, this Google thing actually screwed my previous comment: The first part (vulnerable) output is with GNU bash, version 4.3.28(1)-release (powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu)

     Are the tests at https://github.com/hannob/bashcheck/blob/master/bashcheck actually valid?

     They are probably OK, although I certainly haven't tested on ARM. But for most part, just get Florian's patch and be done with it, there's little value in testing for individual issues.

     But it's already applied! Better said, the upstream one: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027 ; also the today's 028 patch is applied. Why's the thing \*still\* segfaulting on PowerPC and not ARM or x86/amd64?

   Thanks for watching our backs and catching the bash s/w defect. Can you post some more tests here to help us evaluate whether our bash is vulnerable?

The vulnerability is related to the way in which shell functions are passed though environment variables. The vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject commands into a Bash shell, depending on how the shell is invoked. The Bash shell may be invoked by a number of processes including, but not limited to, telnet, SSH, DHCP, and scripts hosted on web servers. All versions of GNU Bash starting with version 1.14 are affected by this vulnerability and the specific impact is determined by the characteristics of the process using the Bash shell. In the worst case, an unauthenticated remote attacker would be able to execute commands on an affected server. However, in most cases involving Cisco products, authentication is required before exploitation could be attempted.  Affected Products  * Cisco is currently investigating it's product line to determine which products may be affected and the extent of the impact of the vulnerability on it's products. Additional Cisco products will be added as the investigation progresses.       **The following Cisco products are currently under investigation**      *None*   Vulnerable ProductsCustomers interested in tracking the progress of any of the following bugs can visit the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool") to view the defect details and optionally select *Save Bug* and activate the *Email Notification* feature to receive automatic notifications when the bug is updated.

bash shell allows shell variables and functions to be exported to a child from its parent through the process environment. Function definitions are passed using environment variables that share the name of the function and start with `() {`.       The child bash process does not stop processing and executing code after processing the closing brace `}` which is passed in the function definition. An attacker could define a function variable such as: `FUNCT=() { ignored; }; /bin/id` to execute **/bin/id** when the environment is imported into the child process.       The impact of this vulnerability on Cisco products may vary depending on the affected product because some attack vectors such as SSH, require successful authentication to be exploited and may not result in any additional privileges granted to the user.      This vulnerability has been assigned the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278.      Several software tools have been created to help administrators identify if the version of Bash running on their platforms has been fixed. Several of these tools provide false positive results or crash the Bash shell. The information provided for each bug ID in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool") identifies the versions of software that contain the fixed code and should be used to determine if a product is vulnerable.  Workarounds  * There are no mitigations for this vulnerability that can be performed directly on affected systems. However, the following network based mitigations may be of use to some customers.   + Cisco Intrusion Protection System (IPS) signature 4689-0 has been created and is available in release S824   + Cisco Sourcefire has published Snort signatures 31975-31977, 31985, 32038-32039, 32041-32043, 32045-32047, and 32049 to detect and protect networks against the Bash vulnerabilityCisco has published an Event Response for this vulnerability:   <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/Cisco_ERP_Bash_09252014.html>       Mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices in a network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=35836>  Fixed Software  * Cisco will be providing software upgrades for vulnerable products. Information regarding the fix, including software versions that contain fixes can be found by referencing the Cisco bug ID from the list of vulnerable products and entering it in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/ "Bug Search Tool").

# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in Bash affect IBM Workload Deployer (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Bash is available in Red Hat Linux virtual machine images that can be deployed by using IBM Workload Deployer. Six Bash vulnerabilities were disclosed in September 2014. This bulletin addresses the vulnerabilities that have been referred to as “Bash Bug” or “Shellshock” and two memory corruption vulnerabilities. Bash is used by IBM Workload Deployer.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVE-ID**: [CVE-2014-6271](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

## Affected Products and Versions

All versions of IBM Workload Deployer 3.1 and later fix packs

## Remediation/Fixes

The solution is to apply the fixes with the following direction:

Upgrade the deployed virtual machines by using one of the following two methods:

**Option 1:** Update the virtual machine by using an eFix provided by IBM:

* Download the eFix from IBM Fix Central (see the following link):

<http://www-933.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~WebSphere&product=ibm/WebSphere/IBM+Workload+Deployer&release=All&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=HV_RHEL6_X64_PATCHES_EFIX&includeSupersedes=0>
* Import the eFix into the IBM Workload Deployer Emergency Fix catalog.

* For deployed instances, apply this Emergency Fix on the virtual machine. Bash is upgraded to version bash-4.1.2-15.e16\_5.2.

**Option 2:** Upgrade the virtual machine with fixes obtained from Red Hat

* Contact Red Hat to obtain fixes and install these fixes directly on the deployed virtual machines as needed.

For images, you must extend and capture the image by using the following general procedure:

1. Import the eFix into the IBM Workload Deployer Emergency Fix catalog.
2. From the image catalog, select the image and click "Extend."
3. After the image extend operation completes succcessfully, click Service from the deployed virtual machine.
4. Apply this emergency fix.
5. From the image catalog, capture the image.

Use this newly captured image for future deployment.

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CVE-2014-6278

| **Name** | CVE-2014-6278 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-6278) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-6278); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2014-6278), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2014-6278), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2014-6278), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2014-6278), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-6278), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6278), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-6278), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-6278)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2014-6278)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2014-6278%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2014-6278%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2014-6278%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

## Vulnerable and fixed packages

The table below lists information on source packages.

| Source Package | Release | Version | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [bash](/tracker/source-package/bash) ([PTS](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/bash)) | bullseye | 5.1-2+deb11u1 | fixed |
|  | bookworm | 5.2.15-2 | fixed |
|  | sid, trixie | 5.2.37-1 | fixed |

The information below is based on the following data on fixed versions.

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [bash](/tracker/source-package/bash) | source | squeeze | 4.1-3+deb6u2 | high |  |  |
| [bash](/tracker/source-package/bash) | source | wheezy | 4.2+dfsg-0.1+deb7u3 | high |  |  |
| [bash](/tracker/source-package/bash) | source | (unstable) | 4.3-9.2 | high |  |  |

## Notes

```
Florian Weimer's variables-affix.patch patch applied in Debian prevents
exploitation of this issue by making bash only use environment variables
with specific names (BASH_FUNC_*()) to define functions from its
environment.

This is kinda long.  == Background ==  If you are not familiar with the original bash function export vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271), you may want to have a look at this article:  <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html>  Well, long story short: the initial maintainer-provided patch for this issue [1] (released on September 24) is *conclusively* broken.  After nagging people to update for a while [5] [7], I wanted to share the technical details of two previously non-public issues which may be used to circumvent the original patch: CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278.  Note that the issues discussed here are separate from the three probably less severe problems publicly disclosed earlier on: Tavis' limited-exploitability EOL bug (CVE-2014-7169) and two likely non-exploitable one-off issues found by Florian Weimer and Todd Sabin (CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187).  == Required actions ==  If you have installed just the September 24 patch [1], or that and the follow-up September 26 patch for CVE-2014-7169 [2], you are likely still vulnerable to RCE and need to update ASAP, as discussed in [5].  You are safe if you have installed the unofficial function prefix patch from Florian Weimer [3], or its upstream variant released on September 28 [4]. The patch does not eliminate the problems, but shields the underlying parser from untrusted inputs under normal circumstances.  Note: over the past few days, Florian's patch has been picked up by major Linux distros (Red Hat, Debian, SUSE, etc), so there is a reasonable probability that you are in good shape. To test, execute this command from within a bash shell:  foo='() { echo not patched; }' bash -c foo  If you see "not patched", you probably want upgrade immediately. If you see "bash: foo: command not found", you're OK.  == Vulnerability details: CVE-2014-6277 (the more involved one) ==  The following function definition appearing in the value of any environmental variable passed to bash will lead to an attempt to dereference attacker-controlled pointers (provided that the targeted instance of bash is protected only with the original patches [1][2] and does not include Florian's fix):  () { x() { _; }; x() { _; } <<a; }  A more complete example leading to a deref of 0x41414141 would be:  HTTP_COOKIE="() { x() { _; }; x() { _; } <<`perl -e '{print "A"x1000}'`; }" bash -c :  bash[25662]: segfault at 41414141 ip 00190d96 sp bfbe6354 error 4 in libc-2.12.so[110000+191000]  (If you are seeing 0xdfdfdfdf, see note later on).  The issue is caused by an uninitialized here_doc_eof field in a REDIR struct originally created in make_redirection(). The initial segv will happen due to an attempt to read and then copy a string to a new buffer through a macro that expands to:  strcpy (xmalloc (1 + strlen (redirect->here_doc_eof)), (redirect->here_doc_eof))  This appears to be exploitable in at least one way: if here_doc_eof is chosen by the attacker to point in the vicinity of the current stack pointer, the apparent contents of the string - and therefore its length - may change between stack-based calls to xmalloc() and strcpy() as a natural consequence of an attempt to pass parameters and create local variables. Such a mid-macro switch will result in an out-of-bounds write to the newly-allocated memory.  A simple conceptual illustration of this attack vector would be:  -- snip! -- char* result; int len_alloced;  main(int argc, char** argv) {    /* The offset will be system- and compiler-specific */;   char* ptr = &ptr - 9;    result = strcpy (malloc(100 + (len_alloced = strlen(ptr))), ptr);    printf("requested memory = %d\n"          "copied text = %d\n", len_alloced + 1, strlen(result) + 1); } -- snip! --  When compiled with the -O2 flag used for bash, on one test system, this produces:  requested memory = 2 copied text = 28  This can lead to heap corruption, with multiple writes possible per payload by simply increasing the number of malformed here-docs. The consequences should be fairly clear.  [ There is also a latter call to free() on here_doc_eof in dispose_cmd.c, but because of the simultaneous discovery of the much simpler bug '78 discussed in the next section, I have not spent a whole lot of time trying to figure out how to get to that path. ]  Perhaps notably, the ability to specify attacker-controlled addresses hinges on the state of --enable-bash-malloc and --enable-mem-scramble compile-time flags; if both are enabled, the memory returned by xmalloc() will be initialized to 0xdf, making the prospect of exploitation more speculative (essentially depending on whether the stack or any other memory region can be grown to overlap with 0xdfdfdfdf). That said, many Linux distributions disable one or both flags and are vulnerable out-of-the-box. It is also of note that relatively few distributions compile bash as PIE, so there is little consolation to be found in ASLR.  Similarly to the original vulnerability, this issue can be usually triggered remotely through web servers such as Apache (provided that they invoke CGI scripts or PHP / Python / Perl / C / Java servlets that rely on system() or popen()-type libcalls); through DHCP clients; and through some MUAs and MTAs. For a more detailed discussion of the exposed attack surface, refer to [6].  == Vulnerability details: CVE-2014-6278 (the "back to the '90s" one) ==  The following function definition appearing in the value of any environmental variable passed to bash 4.2 or 4.3 will lead to straightforward put-your-command-here RCE (again, provided that the targeted instance is not protected with Florian's patch):  () { _; } >_[$($())] { echo hi mom; id; }  A complete example looks like this:  HTTP_COOKIE='() { _; } >_[$($())] { echo hi mom; id; }' bash -c :  ...or:  GET /some/script.cgi HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: () { _; } >_[$($())] { id >/tmp/hi_mom; }  Note that the PoC does not work as-is in more ancient versions of bash, such as 2.x or 3.x; it might have been introduced with xparse_dolparen() starting with bash 4.2 patch level 12 few years back, but I have not investigated this in a lot of detail. Florian's patch is strongly recommended either way.  The attack surface through which this flaw may be triggered is roughly similar to that for CVE-2014-6277 and the original bash bug [6].  == Additional info ==  Both of these issues were identified in an automated fashion with american fuzzy lop:  <https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop>  The out-of-the-box fuzzer was seeded with a minimal valid function definition ("() { foo() { foo; }; >bar; }") and allowed to run for a couple of hours on a single core.  In addition to the issues discussed above, the fuzzer also hit three of the four previously-reported CVEs.  I initially shared the findings privately with vendors, but because of the intense scrutiny that this codebase is under, the ease of reproducing these results with an open-source fuzzer, and the now-broad availability of upstream mitigations, there seems to be relatively little value in continued secrecy.  == References ==  [1] <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-025> [2] <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-026> [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13> [4] <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027> [5] <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html> [6] <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html> [7] <http://www.pcworld.com/article/2688932/improved-patch-tackles-new-shellshock-attack-vectors.html>  PS.

# CVE-2014-6277

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6272.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6278.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6277 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6277)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access, and untrusted-pointer read and write operations) via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### [Bash bug: apply Florian's patch now (CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html)

OK, rebuild bash and deploy [Florian's unofficial patch](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) or its [now-upstream version](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027) now. If you're a distro maintainer, please consider doing the same.My [previous post](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html) has more information about the original vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271). It also explains Tavis' and my original negative sentiment toward the [original upstream patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-025). In short, the revised code did not stop bash from parsing the code seen in potentially attacker-controlled, remotely-originating environmental variables. Instead, the fix simply seeks to harden the parsing to prevent RCE. It relies on two risky assumptions:

* That spare for this one bug we're fixing now, the process of parsing attacker-controlled functions is guaranteed to have no side effects on the subsequently executed trusted code.* That the underlying parser, despite probably not being designed to deal with attacker-supplied inputs, is free from the usual range of C language bugs.

From the very early hours, we have argued on the [oss-security mailing list](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/663) that a more reasonable approach would be to shield the parser from remotely-originating strings. I proposed putting the function export functionality behind a runtime flag or using a separate, prefixed namespace for the exported functions - so that variables such as `HTTP_COOKIE` do not go through this code path at all. Unfortunately, we made no real progress on that early in the game.Soon thereafter, people started to bump into additional problems in the parser code. The first assumption behind the patch - the one about the parsing process not having other side effects - was quickly proved wrong by [Tavis](https://twitter.com/taviso/status/514887394294652929), who came up with a code construct that would get the parser in an inconsistent state, causing bash to create a bogus file and mangle any subsequent code that `/bin/sh` is supposed to execute.This was assigned CVE-2014-7169 and led to a round of high-profile press reports claiming that we're still doomed, and people assigning the new bug [CVSS scores all the way up to 11](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-7169). The reality was a bit more nuanced: the glitch demonstrated by Tavis' code is a bit less concerning, because it does not translate into a universally exploitable RCE - at least not as far as we could figure it out. Some uses of `/bin/sh` would be at risk, but most would just break in a probably-non-exploitable way. The maintainer followed with [another patch](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-026) that locked down this specific hole.The second assumption started showing cracks, too. First came a report from Todd Sabin, who identified an [static array overflow error](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/32) when parsing more than ten stacked redirects. The bug, assigned CVE-2014-7186, would cause a crash, but given the nature of the underlying assignment, immediate exploitability seemed fairly unlikely. Another probably non-security off-by-one issue with line counting in loops cropped up shortly thereafter (CVE-2014-7187).The two latter issues do not have an officially released upstream patch at that point, but they prompted Florian Weimer of Red Hat to develop an unofficial patch that takes a seemingly more durable approach that we argued for earlier on: [putting function exports in a separate namespace](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13). Florian's fix effectively isolates the function parsing code from attacker-controlled strings in almost all the important use cases we can currently think of.(One major outlier would be any solutions that rely on blacklisting environmental variables to run restricted shells or restricted commands as a privileged user - sudo-type stuff - but it's a much smaller attack surface and a a very dubious security boundary to begin with.)Well... so, to get to the point: I've been fuzzing the underlying function parser on the side - and yesterday, bumped into a new parsing issue (CVE-2014-6277) that is almost certainly remotely exploitable and made easier to leverage due to the fact that bash is [seldom compiled with ASLR](https://twitter.com/scarybeasts/status/515774894718459904). I'll share the technical details later on; for now, I sent the info to the maintainer of bash and to several key Linux distros. In general terms, it's an attempt to access uninitialized memory leading to reads from, and then subsequent writes to, a pointer that is fully within attacker's control. Here's a pretty telling crash:
bash[3054]: segfault at 41414141 ip 00190d96 ...

Soon after posting this entry, I also bumped in the sixth and most severe issue so far, essentially permitting very simple and straightforward remote code execution (CVE-2014-6278) on the systems that are patched against the first bug. It's a "put your commands here" type of a bug similar to the original report. I will post additional details in a couple of days to give people enough time to upgrade.At this point, I **very strongly** recommend manually deploying [Florian's patch](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13) unless your distro is already shipping it. (Florian's patch has been also finally included [upstream](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html) shortly after I first posted this entry.)From within the shell itself, the simplest way to check if you already have it installed would be:
\_x='() { echo vulnerable; }' bash -c '\_x 2>/dev/null || echo not vulnerable'

If the command shows "vulnerable", you don't have the patch and you are still vulnerable to a (currently non-public) RCE, even if you applied the original one (or the subsequent upstream patch that addressed the issue found by Tavis).

   "The patch should apply cleanly to bash 4.2, but requires one minor tweak for 4.3." I'm trying to apply it to 4.3.25(1), what's the "one minor tweak" that you're referring to?

     One chunk in variables.c will fail because of few extra lines around:

      report\_error (\_("error importing function definition for `%s'"), name);

     In essence, you should reconcile what ends up in variables.c.rej manually. Most of it should be obvious. The "Restore the original suffix." part from the patch should go right after the first closing curly bracket underneath the existing "error importing function definition" bit.

     ie.
      else
      {
      if (temp\_var = bind\_variable (name, string, 0))
      {
      VSETATTR (temp\_var, (att\_exported | att\_imported | att\_invisible));

      }
      last\_command\_exit\_value = 1;
      report\_error (\_("error importing function definition for `%s'"), name);
      }

      /\* Restore the original suffix. \*/
      temp\_name[name\_length] = FUNCDEF\_SUFFIX[0];
     ...right?

   These "toughten the feature" patches still feel quite scary.

   Since the feature seem to be so rarely used, how come it isn't off by default already ? Enable it via some ENV var or shopt (bonus point if you can restrict it to specific variable names), and let people who need it take the necessary security steps.

   I have a question. When my bash is vulnerable to CVE-2014-6278, How do i check this vulnerablity?? Is the same the result of CVE-2014-6277???

     There's only one patch, addressing both. The test case provided at the bottom of the blog post tests for the presence of this patch.

     Sigh, this Google thing actually screwed my previous comment: The first part (vulnerable) output is with GNU bash, version 4.3.28(1)-release (powerpc-unknown-linux-gnu)

     Are the tests at https://github.com/hannob/bashcheck/blob/master/bashcheck actually valid?

     They are probably OK, although I certainly haven't tested on ARM. But for most part, just get Florian's patch and be done with it, there's little value in testing for individual issues.

     But it's already applied! Better said, the upstream one: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027 ; also the today's 028 patch is applied. Why's the thing \*still\* segfaulting on PowerPC and not ARM or x86/amd64?

   Thanks for watching our backs and catching the bash s/w defect. Can you post some more tests here to help us evaluate whether our bash is vulnerable?

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-09-29 08:40:40 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in bash, which could be exploited remotely via applications which parse untrusted user scripts via bash. This flaw is different from [CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277), [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) and [CVE-2014-7186](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-09-29 11:32:18 UTC  ``` This issue is mentioned publicly in Michal Zalewski's blog post:  <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html>  It does not provide any details of the issue other than describing it as:    ... I also bumped in the sixth and most severe issue so far, essentially   permitting very simple and straightforward remote code execution   ([CVE-2014-6278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278)) on the systems that are patched against the first bug. It's   a "put your commands here" type of a bug similar to the original report. I   will post additional details in a couple of days to give people enough time   to upgrade.  However, the bash updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux released via RHSA-2014:1306, RHSA-2014:1311, and RHSA-2014:1312 include a function name mangling patch as described in [bug 1146319 comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=1146319#c51 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-7169 bash: code execution via specially-crafted environment (Incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271)").  It prevents exploitation of this issue by making bash only use environment variables with specific names (currently BASH_FUNC_*()) to define functions from its environment.  This change blocks currently known exploitation vectors and is also recommended by Michal Zalewski, the original reporter of this issue.  Links to errata that introduced the function name mangling patch:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html>  Knowledge base article for the "Shellshock" vulnerability, that also explains the function name mangling change in the "How does this impact systems" section:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223>  This bug will be updated with further details of this particular issue once they are made public.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c11)  Eric Blake    2014-10-02 04:28:55 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1148661](show_bug.cgi?id=1148661 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - [abrt] bash: strlen(): bash killed by SIGSEGV") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c12)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-02 05:05:29 UTC  ``` Further details:  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Oct/9> <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/bash-bug-how-we-finally-cracked.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c15)  Max    2014-10-05 21:30:25 UTC  ``` Another user experienced a similar problem:  This was caused by attempting Exploit 7 ([CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277)) listed on shellshocker.net: bash -c "f() { x() { _;}; x() { _;} <<a; }" 2>/dev/null || echo vulnerable  reporter:       libreport-2.2.3 backtrace_rating: 4 cmdline:        bash -c 'f() { x() { _;}; x() { _;} <<a; }' crash_function: strlen executable:     /usr/bin/bash kernel:         3.16.3-200.fc20.x86_64 package:        bash-4.2.48-2.fc20 reason:         bash killed by SIGSEGV runlevel:       N 5 type:           CCpp uid:            1000   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c16)  Max    2014-10-05 21:30:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 944106](attachment.cgi?id=944106 "File: backtrace") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=944106&action=edit "File: backtrace") File: backtrace   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c17)  Stuart D Gathman    2014-10-06 16:22:18 UTC  ``` Another user experienced a similar problem:  Running bash check script at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hannob/bashcheck/master/bashcheck>  reporter:       libreport-2.2.3 backtrace_rating: 4 cmdline:        /usr/bin/bash -c 'f(){ x(){ _;};x(){ _;}<<a;}' crash_function: strlen executable:     /usr/bin/bash kernel:         3.16.3-200.fc20.i686 package:        bash-4.2.48-2.fc20 reason:         bash killed by SIGSEGV runlevel:       N 5 type:           CCpp uid:            1000   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c20)  Florian Weimer    2014-10-07 21:02:12 UTC  ``` We can reproduce this parser bug.  But we treat this as a regular bug, not a security bug, because of the fixes mentioned in [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c2).   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-08 20:38:41 UTC  ``` This parser bug was corrected upstream in bash 4.3p30, 4.2p53, 4.1p17, 4.0p44, 3.2p57, 3.1p23, 3.0p22 and 2.05b p13.  <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-030>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c25)  Vincent Danen    2014-10-14 14:15:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat no longer considers this bug to be a security issue. The change introduced in bash errata RHSA-2014:1306, RHSA-2014:1311 and RHSA-2014:1312 removed the exposure of the bash parser to untrusted input, mitigating this problem to a bug without security impact.   ``` |  |

# CVE-2014-7169

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-7156.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-7185.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-7169 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

# USN-2380-1: Bash vulnerabilities

9 October 2014

Several security issues were fixed in Bash.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [bash](/security/cves?package=bash) - The GNU Bourne Again SHell

## Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that Bash incorrectly handled parsing certain

function definitions. If an attacker were able to create an environment

variable containing a function definition with a very specific name, these

issues could possibly be used to bypass certain environment restrictions

and execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-6277](/security/CVE-2014-6277), [CVE-2014-6278](/security/CVE-2014-6278))

Please note that the previous Bash security update, USN-2364-1, includes

a hardening measure that prevents these issues from being used in a

Shellshock attack.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [bash](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/bash)
  -
  [4.3-7ubuntu1.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/bash/4.3-7ubuntu1.5)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [bash](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/bash)
  -
  [4.2-2ubuntu2.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/bash/4.2-2ubuntu2.6)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [bash](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/bash)
  -
  [4.1-2ubuntu3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/bash/4.1-2ubuntu3.5)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

Invalid CVSS vector, please try again with a valid CVSS vector.

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P/E:F/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2014-09-29 08:40:40 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in bash, which could be exploited remotely via applications which parse untrusted user scripts via bash. This flaw is different from [CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277), [CVE-2014-7169](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169) and [CVE-2014-7186](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-09-29 11:32:18 UTC  ``` This issue is mentioned publicly in Michal Zalewski's blog post:  <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html>  It does not provide any details of the issue other than describing it as:    ... I also bumped in the sixth and most severe issue so far, essentially   permitting very simple and straightforward remote code execution   ([CVE-2014-6278](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278)) on the systems that are patched against the first bug. It's   a "put your commands here" type of a bug similar to the original report. I   will post additional details in a couple of days to give people enough time   to upgrade.  However, the bash updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux released via RHSA-2014:1306, RHSA-2014:1311, and RHSA-2014:1312 include a function name mangling patch as described in [bug 1146319 comment 51](show_bug.cgi?id=1146319#c51 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-7169 bash: code execution via specially-crafted environment (Incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271)").  It prevents exploitation of this issue by making bash only use environment variables with specific names (currently BASH_FUNC_*()) to define functions from its environment.  This change blocks currently known exploitation vectors and is also recommended by Michal Zalewski, the original reporter of this issue.  Links to errata that introduced the function name mangling patch:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1306.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1312.html>  Knowledge base article for the "Shellshock" vulnerability, that also explains the function name mangling change in the "How does this impact systems" section:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/1200223>  This bug will be updated with further details of this particular issue once they are made public.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c11)  Eric Blake    2014-10-02 04:28:55 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1148661](show_bug.cgi?id=1148661 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - [abrt] bash: strlen(): bash killed by SIGSEGV") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c12)  Murray McAllister    2014-10-02 05:05:29 UTC  ``` Further details:  <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Oct/9> <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/10/bash-bug-how-we-finally-cracked.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c15)  Max    2014-10-05 21:30:25 UTC  ``` Another user experienced a similar problem:  This was caused by attempting Exploit 7 ([CVE-2014-6277](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277)) listed on shellshocker.net: bash -c "f() { x() { _;}; x() { _;} <<a; }" 2>/dev/null || echo vulnerable  reporter:       libreport-2.2.3 backtrace_rating: 4 cmdline:        bash -c 'f() { x() { _;}; x() { _;} <<a; }' crash_function: strlen executable:     /usr/bin/bash kernel:         3.16.3-200.fc20.x86_64 package:        bash-4.2.48-2.fc20 reason:         bash killed by SIGSEGV runlevel:       N 5 type:           CCpp uid:            1000   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c16)  Max    2014-10-05 21:30:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 944106](attachment.cgi?id=944106 "File: backtrace") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=944106&action=edit "File: backtrace") File: backtrace   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c17)  Stuart D Gathman    2014-10-06 16:22:18 UTC  ``` Another user experienced a similar problem:  Running bash check script at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hannob/bashcheck/master/bashcheck>  reporter:       libreport-2.2.3 backtrace_rating: 4 cmdline:        /usr/bin/bash -c 'f(){ x(){ _;};x(){ _;}<<a;}' crash_function: strlen executable:     /usr/bin/bash kernel:         3.16.3-200.fc20.i686 package:        bash-4.2.48-2.fc20 reason:         bash killed by SIGSEGV runlevel:       N 5 type:           CCpp uid:            1000   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c20)  Florian Weimer    2014-10-07 21:02:12 UTC  ``` We can reproduce this parser bug.  But we treat this as a regular bug, not a security bug, because of the fixes mentioned in [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c2).   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2014-10-08 20:38:41 UTC  ``` This parser bug was corrected upstream in bash 4.3p30, 4.2p53, 4.1p17, 4.0p44, 3.2p57, 3.1p23, 3.0p22 and 2.05b p13.  <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-030>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1147414#c25)  Vincent Danen    2014-10-14 14:15:02 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat no longer considers this bug to be a security issue. The change introduced in bash errata RHSA-2014:1306, RHSA-2014:1311 and RHSA-2014:1312 removed the exposure of the bash parser to untrusted input, mitigating this problem to a bug without security impact.   ``` |  |

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

# CVE-2014-6278

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6277.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6300.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6278 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6278)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This issue is already mitigated (fixed) by the function hardening patch introduced in the update for [CVE-2014-7169](http://support.novell.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7169.html). We are currently not able to reproduce this at all on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 or older, so likely bash 3.2 seems not to be affected.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [898604](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898604) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898812](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898812) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [898884](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=898884) [RESOLVED / WONTFIX], [900127](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=900127) [RESOLVED / INVALID]

NOTE: HP strongly recommends implementing the following security best
practices to help reduce both known and future security vulnerability risks:

Isolate the HP Integrity Server's management network by keeping it separate
from the data or production network, and not connecting it directly to the
Internet without additional access authentication.
Patch and maintain Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and web
servers.
Use virus scanners, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and
vulnerability scanners regularly.
Apply all recommended HP Firmware updates.

##### 3. Problem Description

a. Bash update for multiple products.

Bash libraries have been updated in multiple products to resolve multiple critical security issues, also referred to as Shellshock.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the identifiers CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, and CVE-2014-7187, CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278 to these issues.

VMware products have been grouped into the following four product categories:

**I) ESXi and ESX Hypervisor**
ESXi is not affected because ESXi uses the Ash shell (through busybox), which is not affected by the vulnerability reported for the Bash shell. ESX has an affected version of the Bash shell.
See table 1 for remediation for ESX.

**II) Windows-based products**
Windows-based products, including all versions of vCenter Server running on Windows, are not affected.

**III) VMware (virtual) appliances**
VMware (virtual) appliances ship with an affected version of Bash.
See table 2 for remediation for appliances.

**IV) Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding virtual appliances)**
Products that run on Linux, Android, OSX or iOS (excluding virtual appliances) might use the Bash shell that is part of the operating system. If the operating system has a vulnerable version of Bash, the Bash security vulnerability might be exploited through the product. VMware recommends that customers contact their operating system vendor for a patch.

MITIGATIONS

VMware encourages restricting access to appliances through firewall rules and other network layer controls to only trusted IP addresses. This measure will greatly reduce any risk to these appliances.

RECOMMENDATIONS

VMware recommends customers evaluate and deploy patches for affected products in Table 1 and 2 below as these patches become available.

For several products, both a patch and a product update are available. In general, if a patch is made available, the patch must be applied to the latest version of the appliance.

Customers should refer to the specific product Knowledge Base articles listed in Section 4 to understand the type of remediation available and applicable appliance version numbers.

Column 4 of the following tables lists the action required to remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is available.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# CVE-2014-6271

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6270.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6272.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6271 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6271)

#### Description

GNU Bash through 4.3 processes trailing strings after function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution, aka "ShellShock." NOTE: the original fix for this issue was incorrect; CVE-2014-7169 has been assigned to cover the vulnerability that is still present after the incorrect fix.

GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function
definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted environment, as
demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd,
the mod\_cgi and mod\_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts
executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting
the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution.
NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-7169, and CVE-2014-6277.

## Notes

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

this issue is mitigated by Florian Weimer's prefix-suffix patch
that is included in https://ubuntu.com/security/notices/USN-2364-1
since bash parser vulnerabilities are now limited to specially
named environment variables, and as such are no longer directly
exposed to CGI scripts, SSH, etc.
Once an upstream patch is made available, we will release bash
updates, but we don't consider this to be a critical issue
requiring immediate attention.

This is kinda long.  == Background ==  If you are not familiar with the original bash function export vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271), you may want to have a look at this article:  <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html>  Well, long story short: the initial maintainer-provided patch for this issue [1] (released on September 24) is *conclusively* broken.  After nagging people to update for a while [5] [7], I wanted to share the technical details of two previously non-public issues which may be used to circumvent the original patch: CVE-2014-6277 and CVE-2014-6278.  Note that the issues discussed here are separate from the three probably less severe problems publicly disclosed earlier on: Tavis' limited-exploitability EOL bug (CVE-2014-7169) and two likely non-exploitable one-off issues found by Florian Weimer and Todd Sabin (CVE-2014-7186 and CVE-2014-7187).  == Required actions ==  If you have installed just the September 24 patch [1], or that and the follow-up September 26 patch for CVE-2014-7169 [2], you are likely still vulnerable to RCE and need to update ASAP, as discussed in [5].  You are safe if you have installed the unofficial function prefix patch from Florian Weimer [3], or its upstream variant released on September 28 [4]. The patch does not eliminate the problems, but shields the underlying parser from untrusted inputs under normal circumstances.  Note: over the past few days, Florian's patch has been picked up by major Linux distros (Red Hat, Debian, SUSE, etc), so there is a reasonable probability that you are in good shape. To test, execute this command from within a bash shell:  foo='() { echo not patched; }' bash -c foo  If you see "not patched", you probably want upgrade immediately. If you see "bash: foo: command not found", you're OK.  == Vulnerability details: CVE-2014-6277 (the more involved one) ==  The following function definition appearing in the value of any environmental variable passed to bash will lead to an attempt to dereference attacker-controlled pointers (provided that the targeted instance of bash is protected only with the original patches [1][2] and does not include Florian's fix):  () { x() { _; }; x() { _; } <<a; }  A more complete example leading to a deref of 0x41414141 would be:  HTTP_COOKIE="() { x() { _; }; x() { _; } <<`perl -e '{print "A"x1000}'`; }" bash -c :  bash[25662]: segfault at 41414141 ip 00190d96 sp bfbe6354 error 4 in libc-2.12.so[110000+191000]  (If you are seeing 0xdfdfdfdf, see note later on).  The issue is caused by an uninitialized here_doc_eof field in a REDIR struct originally created in make_redirection(). The initial segv will happen due to an attempt to read and then copy a string to a new buffer through a macro that expands to:  strcpy (xmalloc (1 + strlen (redirect->here_doc_eof)), (redirect->here_doc_eof))  This appears to be exploitable in at least one way: if here_doc_eof is chosen by the attacker to point in the vicinity of the current stack pointer, the apparent contents of the string - and therefore its length - may change between stack-based calls to xmalloc() and strcpy() as a natural consequence of an attempt to pass parameters and create local variables. Such a mid-macro switch will result in an out-of-bounds write to the newly-allocated memory.  A simple conceptual illustration of this attack vector would be:  -- snip! -- char* result; int len_alloced;  main(int argc, char** argv) {    /* The offset will be system- and compiler-specific */;   char* ptr = &ptr - 9;    result = strcpy (malloc(100 + (len_alloced = strlen(ptr))), ptr);    printf("requested memory = %d\n"          "copied text = %d\n", len_alloced + 1, strlen(result) + 1); } -- snip! --  When compiled with the -O2 flag used for bash, on one test system, this produces:  requested memory = 2 copied text = 28  This can lead to heap corruption, with multiple writes possible per payload by simply increasing the number of malformed here-docs. The consequences should be fairly clear.  [ There is also a latter call to free() on here_doc_eof in dispose_cmd.c, but because of the simultaneous discovery of the much simpler bug '78 discussed in the next section, I have not spent a whole lot of time trying to figure out how to get to that path. ]  Perhaps notably, the ability to specify attacker-controlled addresses hinges on the state of --enable-bash-malloc and --enable-mem-scramble compile-time flags; if both are enabled, the memory returned by xmalloc() will be initialized to 0xdf, making the prospect of exploitation more speculative (essentially depending on whether the stack or any other memory region can be grown to overlap with 0xdfdfdfdf). That said, many Linux distributions disable one or both flags and are vulnerable out-of-the-box. It is also of note that relatively few distributions compile bash as PIE, so there is little consolation to be found in ASLR.  Similarly to the original vulnerability, this issue can be usually triggered remotely through web servers such as Apache (provided that they invoke CGI scripts or PHP / Python / Perl / C / Java servlets that rely on system() or popen()-type libcalls); through DHCP clients; and through some MUAs and MTAs. For a more detailed discussion of the exposed attack surface, refer to [6].  == Vulnerability details: CVE-2014-6278 (the "back to the '90s" one) ==  The following function definition appearing in the value of any environmental variable passed to bash 4.2 or 4.3 will lead to straightforward put-your-command-here RCE (again, provided that the targeted instance is not protected with Florian's patch):  () { _; } >_[$($())] { echo hi mom; id; }  A complete example looks like this:  HTTP_COOKIE='() { _; } >_[$($())] { echo hi mom; id; }' bash -c :  ...or:  GET /some/script.cgi HTTP/1.0 User-Agent: () { _; } >_[$($())] { id >/tmp/hi_mom; }  Note that the PoC does not work as-is in more ancient versions of bash, such as 2.x or 3.x; it might have been introduced with xparse_dolparen() starting with bash 4.2 patch level 12 few years back, but I have not investigated this in a lot of detail. Florian's patch is strongly recommended either way.  The attack surface through which this flaw may be triggered is roughly similar to that for CVE-2014-6277 and the original bash bug [6].  == Additional info ==  Both of these issues were identified in an automated fashion with american fuzzy lop:  <https://code.google.com/p/american-fuzzy-lop>  The out-of-the-box fuzzer was seeded with a minimal valid function definition ("() { foo() { foo; }; >bar; }") and allowed to run for a couple of hours on a single core.  In addition to the issues discussed above, the fuzzer also hit three of the four previously-reported CVEs.  I initially shared the findings privately with vendors, but because of the intense scrutiny that this codebase is under, the ease of reproducing these results with an open-source fuzzer, and the now-broad availability of upstream mitigations, there seems to be relatively little value in continued secrecy.  == References ==  [1] <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-025> [2] <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-026> [3] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13> [4] <http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027> [5] <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html> [6] <http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2014/09/quick-notes-about-bash-bug-its-impact.html> [7] <http://www.pcworld.com/article/2688932/improved-patch-tackles-new-shellshock-attack-vectors.html>  PS.

b. Download the file 'bash-4.1.2-15.el6_4.2.i686.rpm' for Insight Control for
Linux Red Hat 6.2 i386 from <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-1311.html>
to the temporary directory '$HOME/tmp/bash'.

c. Extract the Bash update software package.

# rpm2cpio bash-4.1.2-15.el6_4.2.i686.rpm| cpio -idmv

d. Verify the version of the Bash update software:

# ./bin/bash --version
GNU bash, version 4.1.2(1)-release (i686-redhat-linux-gnu)

e. Verify version dependencies:

# ldd ./bin/bash

linux-gate.so.1 => (0x008a7000)
libtinfo.so.5 => /lib/libtinfo.so.5 (0x00459000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x002c0000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x0012e000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00108000)

f. Create archive file from '/lib' to copy and install on the Insight Control
for Linux Central Management Server Pre-boot Execution Environment system:

# mkdir $HOME/tmp/lib
# cd /lib
# cp * $HOME/tmp/lib
# cd $HOME/tmp
# pwd
<home directory>/tmp
# tar cvf bash_lib.tar *

2. Download the new archive file '$HOME/tmp/bash_lib.tar' from the Production
RHEL 6.2 OS system to the Insight Control for Linux Central Management Server
Pre-boot Execution Environment system.

3. On the HP Insight Control for Linux Central Managment Server Pre-boot
Execution Environment system:

a. Create a temporary folder for the toolkit and copy the toolkit there :

# mkdir -p $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit
# cp /usr/share/systemimager/boot/i386/standard/toolkit.tar.gz
$HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit

b. Extract the file 'toolkit.tar.gz' into the temporary folder:

# cd $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit
# tar zxvf toolkit.tar.gz
# mv $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/toolkit.tar.gz /tmp

c. Verify the version of the toolkit Bash:

# $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/bin/bash --version
GNU bash, version 3.2.0(1)-release (i386-pc-linux-gnu) Copyright (C) 2005
Free Software Foundation, Inc.

d. Verify dependencies versions:

# ldd $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/bin/bash

linux-gate.so.1 => (0xffffe000)
libtermcap.so.2 => /lib/libtermcap.so.2 (0xf7f8c000)
libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x008bf000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x00777000)
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 (0x00755000)

e. Extract the archive 'bash_lib.tar' to directory '$HOME/tmp/bash_lib' .
Then copy the bash binary and the library files to their respective
locations:

# tar xvf $HOME/tmp/bash_lib
# cp $HOME/tmp/bash_lib/bash/bash $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/bin
# cp $HOME/tmp/bash_lib/lib/* $HOME/tmp/temp-toolkit/lib

f. Create the updated toolkit gzipped archive file and place in
/usr/share/systemimager/boot/i386/standard

# tar czvf toolkit.tar.gz *
# cp toolkit.tar.gz /usr/share/systemimager/boot/i386/standard

## Security Advisory 0006 [PDF](/en/support/advisories-notices/security-advisory/1008-security-advisory-0006?tmpl=component&format=pdf "PDF")

**Date:** September 29th 2014

| Revision | Date | Changes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.0 | September 29th 2014 | Initial release |
| 1.1 | September 30th 2014 | Additional details on maintenance releases |
| 1.2 | October 29th 2014 | Additional details on fixed releases |
| 1.3 | November 4th 2014 | Additional details on fixed releases |

**Shell command Bash code injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-6271, CVE-2014-6278, and CVE-2014-7169)**

On September 24th, Arista became aware of a vulnerability affecting all versions of the bash package shipped with Arista EOS. The bash code injection vulnerability could allow for arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain shell access.

Arista switches are only vulnerable to administrators with current access to the switch CLI. The switch is not vulnerable to remote attack.

A software patch (RPM extension) is available for download. In addition fixes will be integrated for each currently supported version of EOS through regular maintenance releases. Currently supported versions of EOS include 4.9 through 4.14.

BugID’s 99948 and 99949 address the issue.

All models of the Arista 7000 Series of fixed and modular systems are affected.

| EOS Releases Affected | Fixed in | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4.9.0 through 4.9.11 | 4.9.12 | Pending Release |
| 4.10.0 through 4.10.8 | 4.10.9 | Pending Release |
| 4.11.0 through 4.11.10 | 4.11.11 | Released |
| 4.12 through 4.12.8 | 4.12.9 | Released |
| 4.13 through 4.13.8 | 4.13.9 | Released |
| 4.14.0 through 4.14.3 | 4.14.4F | Released |

**Workaround:**
 Available mitigations include restricting access to a set of known trusted users, restricting ssh logins to trusted source IP addresses, and temporarily removing remote access to users with non privileged access.

Customers using Arista’s DHCP extensions or using dhclient in a custom setup may wish to disable the extension if it passes DHCP parameters to bash as environment variables.

**Verification:**
 To determine if the version of EOS is vulnerable use the following command:

```
switch# bash

-bash-4.1# X='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"

X='() { :;}; echo vulnerable' bash -c "echo this is a test"

vulnerable

this is a test
```

If the output of the above command contains a line containing the word “vulnerable” you are using a vulnerable version of Bash. The patch used to fix this issue ensures that no code is allowed after the end of a Bash function.

**Resolution:**

The resolution to this issue is through the installation of a patch, or through upgrading to a version of EOS that contains the resolution. This section will be updated once EOS maintenance releases are available. A patch is currently available.

Download URL for patch:

**Instructions to install the patch for Security Advisory 0006**

The extension is applicable for all EOS versions 4.9.0 - 4.14.3 inclusive.

Step 1. Copy the file secAdvisory0006.swix to the extension partition of the Arista switch using any of the supported file transfer protocols:

```
switch#copy scp://This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it./home/arista/secAdvisory0006.swix extension:
```

Step 2. Ensure that the file has been copied to the extensions partition and verify the checksum of the copied file:

```
switch#show extensions

Name          Version/Release          Status<          RPMs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
secAdvisory0006.swix secAdvisory0006.swix          4.1.14Ar/4.fc14          A, NI          1

A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F:forced

```

To verify the extension, compare the following sha512 or md5 checksum with the output of the verify command:

```
sha512sum: 3cf25bb085c3b3bb84430257887e0ee75f4abe52968d093258ce65cad95450e8163b374429da81db0cecccf344bcb469354fbfa0bc0c9651a33c7b509f89f88f
```
```
md5sum:
084606719ce59e65fb383ad99c50d186
```

**verify commands:**

```
switch#verify /sha512 extension:secAdvisory0006.swix
verify /sha512 (extension:secAdvisory0006.swix) = 3cf25bb085c3b3bb84430257887e0ee75f4abe52968d093258ce65cad95450e8163b374429da81db0cecccf344bcb469354fbfa0bc0c9651a33c7b509f89f88f
```
```
switch#verify /md5 extension:secAdvisory0006.swix
verify /md5 (extension:secAdvisory0006.swix) =
084606719ce59e65fb383ad99c50d186
```

Step 3. The patch is installed as an extension, and upon installation into a live system will automatically install with the following behavior:

```
switch#extension secAdvisory0006.swix
```

All modular switches with dual supervisors require the extension copying and installing on both supervisors.

Verify that the extension has been installed:

```
switch#show extensions

Name          Version/Release          Status          RPMs
----------------------------------------------------------------
secAdvisory0006.swix          4.1.14Ar/4.fc14          A, I           1

A: available | NA: not available | I: installed | NI: not installed | F: forced

```

Step 4. Post installation, any newly initialized shell sessions will use the fixed version of bash.

Note: As the vulnerability exists only during the startup of a new bash instance, existing running shell instances are unlikely to be affected. Existing bash scripts running as part of a custom setup may be restarted to ensure use of the new version of bash.

Step 5. Make the extension persist across reboots:

```
switch#copy installed-extensions boot-extensions
Copy completed successfully.
switch#show boot-extensions
secAdvisory0006.swix
```

Verification of the bash version after resolution:

```
switch#show version detail  | grep -i bash
bash 4.1.14Ar 4.fc14
```
