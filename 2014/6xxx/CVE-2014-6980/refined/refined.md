{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of the SSL/TLS certificate chain, failing to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack via a compromised network (e.g., public WiFi) or other network where the attacker can intercept traffic between the Android device and the server."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the target Android device and needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the device and the server it is communicating with."

  "additional_notes": "The provided document is a vulnerability note from CERT/CC regarding widespread SSL certificate validation failures in Android applications, and not a specific CVE. It does not provide a CVE ID but is assigned the VU#582497. This document links to a spreadsheet that contains a large amount of specific vulnerable applications, it states that 23667 of 1000462 apps tested had this vulnerability. It also provides CVSS metrics for the vulnerability, and indicates that it was first made public on 2012-10-16 but first published by CERT/CC on 2014-09-03"
