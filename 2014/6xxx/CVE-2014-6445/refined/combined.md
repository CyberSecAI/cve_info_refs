## Contact Form 7 Integrations 1.0 - 1.3.10, Reflected XSS

The Contact Form 7 Integrations plugin for WordPress suffers from a Reflected XSS attack on a file which is included by the default plugin installation, named âincludes/toAdmin.phpâ. If both the âuEâ and âuCâ QSAs are provided the input provided is output without undergoing validation, or encoding. A specifically crafted string in either of these QSAs can trigger an XSS vulnerability.

Makes you to sign up to an external service. If you need to track your Contact Form 7’s stats or export the data somewhere, this might be worth your time. Not for me though.
Also, at least one of the 5-star rating is from the authors themselves.

Which would have not been a problem if it actually had a nice design and app architecture.
