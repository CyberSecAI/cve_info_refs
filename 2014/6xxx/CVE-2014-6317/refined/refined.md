Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-6317:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of TrueType font objects in memory within the Windows kernel-mode driver. Specifically, the driver fails to properly validate array indexes when loading TrueType font files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of array indexes when processing TrueType fonts

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS). The target system will stop responding and restart.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Share:** An attacker can place a specially crafted TrueType font on a network share. When a user navigates to this share using Windows Explorer, the affected code path is triggered through the Details and Preview panes.
- **Email Attachment:** An attacker sends a specially crafted file as an email attachment, convincing the user to open it.
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker hosts a website containing a webpage with a malicious TrueType font file. They would need to trick users into visiting the website, often by a link in an email or instant message. Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also host this malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **For Network share attack:** Requires the ability to host a malicious TrueType font on a network share accessible to the victim.
-   **For Email attack:** Requires the ability to send an email to the target with a malicious TrueType font and convince them to open the attachment.
-   **For web-based attack:** Requires the ability to host a webpage containing a malicious TrueType font and convince the user to visit it and open the file in an affected version of Windows.

The content also provides mitigations and workarounds:
- **Mitigations:**
  - Attackers would have to persuade users to visit malicious websites or open attachments, as they cannot force the actions.
-   **Workarounds:**
  - The primary workaround involves denying access to `T2EMBED.DLL`. The provided steps detail how to achieve this on different Windows versions. However, this workaround would cause issues for applications relying on embedded font technology.
