The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6785.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This occurs when the application does not verify that the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, the applications do not properly verify the server certificate. This leads to a vulnerability where a malicious actor can intercept and potentially modify communications.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. This allows them to view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. The impact varies depending on the applicationâ€™s function but can include credential theft, sensitive data exposure, or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*   Attackers must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be on the same network as the target Android device, this includes public WiFi or other untrusted networks.
*   The attacker needs the capability to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Additional Details:**
*   The CERT Coordination Center tested over one million Android applications, identifying over 23,000 that failed dynamic SSL validation tests.
*   A Google Sheets spreadsheet was created to track affected applications and their fixes: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing).
*   The vulnerability was discovered through dynamic testing using CERT Tapioca.
*   The issue is not limited to a single application or vendor, but a widespread problem across the Android ecosystem.
*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-295 and CWE-296.
