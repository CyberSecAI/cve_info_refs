The provided content is related to CVE-2014-6808.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to check the SSL chain of trust when establishing HTTPS connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This can lead to viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential outcomes include credential stealing and arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack occurs over a network.
- Attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs the capability to intercept and modify network traffic (MITM).
