[# Hacking the Sprint AIRAVE 2.5 -- Part 1: A Fly on the Wall](https://billblough.net/blog/2022/03/27/hacking-the-sprint-airave-25-part-1-a-fly-on-the-wall/)

Recently I've taken a deeper interest in hardware, including programming
embedded systems, writing Verilog for FPGA devices, and hardware security
in general. It's a lot of fun to build things, but it can also be a lot of fun
taking things apart or seeing how you can make them fail.

Enter what I've been playing with in my free time for the past week or so: the
Sprint AIRAVE 2.5+.

[![AIRAVE 2.5+](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front_side.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front_side.jpg "AIRAVE 2.5+")

## Background

The Sprint AIRAVE is a [femtocell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtocell). It's used to boost wireless access
in areas where coverage is poor. In short, cellular devices connect to the
AIRAVE as if it were a cellular tower, and the AIRAVE connects to Sprint's
network using a broadband internet connection. From the user perspective,
the calls appear to be using the cellular network (as opposed to something
like WiFi calling), but in reality, the calls are being sent over the broadband
connection to Sprint.

## Motivation

Sometime in the past year, I was contacted by Sprint and notified that after
a certain date, my AIRAVE would no longer be functional, as they were
making changes to the network as part of the T-Mobile merger. That
date has come and gone, so my AIRAVE has been sitting on the shelf
collecting dust. I figured why not see what makes it tick, and maybe find
another use for it. Even if I wind up destroying it in the process, at least
there's a chance of reusing it, rather than just sending it off to the
landfill.

For anyone interested in playing with these, you may be able to pick one up
on eBay or other sites that sell used hardware.

## Board Inspection

Opening the case and removing the board revealed a large heat sink and a couple
of RF-shielded sections.

[![Front of circuit board](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front.jpg "Front of circuit board")

The RF-shielded areas contain the GPS and cellular radio chips. They're not
really important to what I'm trying to do, so I didn't go any further than
looking up the part numbers to identify the chips.

Underneath the heat sink is the CPU (marked in blue) and NAND flash (marked in green).
The CPU is a [Freescale BSC9131 PowerPC](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/161/BSC9131-482835.pdf), and the [NAND flash](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Macronix/MX30LF1G08AA.pdf) holds
128MB. Other chips visible are DDR memory (12 o'clock), a thermal watchdog
(2 o'clock), line drivers (6 o'clock) and an ethernet controller (11 o'clock).

[![Circuit board with heat sink removed](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/cpu_1_markup.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/cpu_1_markup.jpg "Circuit board with heat sink removed")

The back of the board doesn't have much to interest us, except that it's very
easy to see some interesting hole patterns in the lower left corner. My understanding
is that the 14-pin arrangement may be a JTAG interface, but I haven't attempted
to verify this. However, it seemed very likely that the 4-pin array would be
a UART interface, so I proceeded with this assumption.

[![Back of circuit board](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/back.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/back.jpg "Back of circuit board")

## UART Connection

A quick test of the 4-pin array with a digital multimeter identified the
ground and 3.3v pins.

To make things easier, I soldered a header to the UART interface, and connected
my Saleae logic analyzer.

[![Saleae logic analyzer connected to UART header](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae.jpg "Saleae logic analyzer connected to UART header")

Opening Saleae Logic 2, configuring the channels, and booting the AIRAVE made it
very easy to identify the TX pin and view the output from the boot process.

[![Saleae Logic 2 program showing UART output](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae_logic.png)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae_logic.png "Saleae Logic 2 program showing UART output")

With the UART pinout confirmed, the logic levels weren't really needed anymore
so I switched to using an Adafruit FT232H breakout board as a UART-to-USB adapter
and watched the output using picocom.

The boot output gave a lot of detail about the system, including the CPU and
speed, amount of RAM, flash layout, and Linux kernel version. However, there
was no login prompt, nor did it allow me to stop the Uboot process and get
a Uboot shell. So at this point, all I could do was watch the boot, but not
interact. Fortunately, there are sometimes ways around this, which I'll write
about in my next post.

Changes between 1.1.13 and 2.0.0:
---------------------------------
Important notes:
\* The licenses of libVLC and libVLCcore have changed from GPLv2+ to LGPLv2.1+
\* Start/end titles/chapters are now specified with # rather than @ to fix
conflicts with some URLs and file names. For instance, this plays a DVD
from the 2nd chapter of the 1st title up to the 4th chapter of the 3rd
title: vlc dvd://#1:2-3:4
\* The 40+ --\*-caching options were simplified and dumbed down to 4 options:
- --file-caching specifies caching for local files,
- --network-caching specifies caching for network resources,
- --live-caching specifies caching for capture devices and
- --disc-caching specifies caching for local optical media.
All values are expressed in milliseconds as in previous versions.
\* HTTP server IP address, port, and TLS configuration is now centralized:
- The --http-host option sets the address, e.g. "--http-host=[2001:db8::1]".
By default, both :: and 0.0.0.0 are used.
- The --http-port and --https-port options set the port numbers.
By default, 8080 is used for HTTP, and 8443 for HTTPS.
- The TLS credentials are configured with --http-cert (public certificate),
--http-key (private key), --http-ca (optional CA) and
--http-crl (optional CRL).
\* RTSP server IP address and port are updated similarly.
Use --rtsp-host and --rtsp-port respectively.
\* The --miface-addr option does not exist anymore. To select the multicast
output interface, use --miface instead, e.g. --miface=eth0.
\* The Windows version will only work with Windows XP SP2 or later.
Windows 2000 SP4, Windows XP < SP2, Windows 2003 SP0 are now unsupported.
\* The Mac OS version will require Quartz Extreme compatible machines.
Important changes for packagers:
\* The default builds now assume that the operating system uses UTF-8 for
its file systems and files content (except the Windows port). If this is
not acceptable, pass --enable-non-utf8 to the configure script.
Non-UTF-8 file systems support will be removed in future versions.
\* The VLC plugins path can be overridden with the VLC\_PLUGIN\_PATH environment

---------------------------------
Important notes:
----------------
\* This release will need Windows 2000 and Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), or more
recent to work correctly
\* The HTTP interface is now only available on the local machine by default.
If you want to make it available from other machines, you will have to
edit the ".hosts" file.
- On UNIX/Linux, the file is in /usr/share/vlc/http/.hosts
If you're using the old http interface, it's located in
/usr/share/vlc/http/old/.hosts
- On Windows they are in C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\http\.hosts and
C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\http\old\.hosts
- On Mac OS X, you can find it in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/.hosts
and respectively in VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/old/.hosts
\* This version of VLC contains a new interface for Windows and Linux.
This interface has a fullscreen controller and simplified preferences.
This interface lacks the "Streaming Wizard" that used to be present in VLC
0.8.6, but provides basic profiles.
\* The behavior of --sout-keep was changed. It's now activated by default.
\* The marq, mosaic and logo commands in the rc interface changed. They
now require a target name as their first argument. Example:
vlc --sub-filter "marq@test{marquee=Hello}" -I rc
You can then use commands like: @test marq-marquee Goodbye
If you didn't name the object using @test, its name will default to the
plugin name (hence 'marq') in this example.
These new commands are also available in the telnet interface.
\* The "rtp" access output module has been removed.
Please use the RTP stream output instead, e.g.:
Old: '#std{access=rtp,mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2:5004,sap}'
New: '#rtp{mux=ts,dst=239.255.1.2,port=5004,sap}'
\* You now need to append --m3u-extvlcopt to your command line to enable
EXTVLCOPT options parsing in m3u playlists. Note that only a limited set
of options is available to m3u playlists (CVE-2007-6683).
\* The old access:url syntax is no longer supported to resolve ambiguities
with some file names. Use access://url instead.
E.g.: vlc:quit -> vlc://quit ;
udp:@239.255.12.12 -> udp://@239.255.12.12
\* The ffmpeg module has been removed and replaced by the new avcodec,
avformat, swscale (or imgresample if you use a swscale-less ffmpeg build)
and postproc modules.
\* The web plugins ActiveX (IE)/Firefox/Mozilla/Safari now recognize the
following states: IDLE/CLOSE=0, OPENING=1, BUFFERING=2, PLAYING=3, PAUSED=4,
STOPPING=5, FORWARD=6, BACKWARD=7, ENDED=8, ERROR=9. With FORWARD and
BACKWARD being reserved for future implementations and are thus not
functional atm.
\* Croping and padding in transcode are now done using the croppadd video
filter. For example:
transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=croppadd{cropttop=20,cropbottom=30,paddleft=100}}
\* Canvas setting in transcode is now done using the canvas video filter.
For example:
transcode{vcodec=mp2v,vfilter=canvas{width=640,height=480}}
\* Glide video output module has been removed.

[# Hacking the Sprint AIRAVE 2.5 -- Part 1: A Fly on the Wall](https://billblough.net/blog/2022/03/27/hacking-the-sprint-airave-25-part-1-a-fly-on-the-wall/)
Sun 27 March 2022

---

Recently I've taken a deeper interest in hardware, including programming
embedded systems, writing Verilog for FPGA devices, and hardware security
in general. It's a lot of fun to build things, but it can also be a lot of fun
taking things apart or seeing how you can make them fail.

Enter what I've been playing with in my free time for the past week or so: the
Sprint AIRAVE 2.5+.

[![AIRAVE 2.5+](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front_side.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front_side.jpg "AIRAVE 2.5+")

## Background

The Sprint AIRAVE is a [femtocell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtocell). It's used to boost wireless access
in areas where coverage is poor. In short, cellular devices connect to the
AIRAVE as if it were a cellular tower, and the AIRAVE connects to Sprint's
network using a broadband internet connection. From the user perspective,
the calls appear to be using the cellular network (as opposed to something
like WiFi calling), but in reality, the calls are being sent over the broadband
connection to Sprint.

## Motivation

Sometime in the past year, I was contacted by Sprint and notified that after
a certain date, my AIRAVE would no longer be functional, as they were
making changes to the network as part of the T-Mobile merger. That
date has come and gone, so my AIRAVE has been sitting on the shelf
collecting dust. I figured why not see what makes it tick, and maybe find
another use for it. Even if I wind up destroying it in the process, at least
there's a chance of reusing it, rather than just sending it off to the
landfill.

For anyone interested in playing with these, you may be able to pick one up
on eBay or other sites that sell used hardware.

## Board Inspection

Opening the case and removing the board revealed a large heat sink and a couple
of RF-shielded sections.

[![Front of circuit board](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front.jpg "Front of circuit board")

The RF-shielded areas contain the GPS and cellular radio chips. They're not
really important to what I'm trying to do, so I didn't go any further than
looking up the part numbers to identify the chips.

Underneath the heat sink is the CPU (marked in blue) and NAND flash (marked in green).
The CPU is a [Freescale BSC9131 PowerPC](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/161/BSC9131-482835.pdf), and the [NAND flash](https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Macronix/MX30LF1G08AA.pdf) holds
128MB. Other chips visible are DDR memory (12 o'clock), a thermal watchdog
(2 o'clock), line drivers (6 o'clock) and an ethernet controller (11 o'clock).

[![Circuit board with heat sink removed](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/cpu_1_markup.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/cpu_1_markup.jpg "Circuit board with heat sink removed")

The back of the board doesn't have much to interest us, except that it's very
easy to see some interesting hole patterns in the lower left corner. My understanding
is that the 14-pin arrangement may be a JTAG interface, but I haven't attempted
to verify this. However, it seemed very likely that the 4-pin array would be
a UART interface, so I proceeded with this assumption.

[![Back of circuit board](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/back.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/back.jpg "Back of circuit board")

## UART Connection

A quick test of the 4-pin array with a digital multimeter identified the
ground and 3.3v pins.

To make things easier, I soldered a header to the UART interface, and connected
my Saleae logic analyzer.

[![Saleae logic analyzer connected to UART header](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae.jpg)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae.jpg "Saleae logic analyzer connected to UART header")

Opening Saleae Logic 2, configuring the channels, and booting the AIRAVE made it
very easy to identify the TX pin and view the output from the boot process.

[![Saleae Logic 2 program showing UART output](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae_logic.png)](https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae_logic.png "Saleae Logic 2 program showing UART output")

With the UART pinout confirmed, the logic levels weren't really needed anymore
so I switched to using an Adafruit FT232H breakout board as a UART-to-USB adapter
and watched the output using picocom.

The boot output gave a lot of detail about the system, including the CPU and
speed, amount of RAM, flash layout, and Linux kernel version. However, there
was no login prompt, nor did it allow me to stop the Uboot process and get
a Uboot shell. So at this point, all I could do was watch the boot, but not
interact. Fortunately, there are sometimes ways around this, which I'll write
about in my next post.

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (âNetwork Mapperâ) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the âinteresting ports
tableâ.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [ExampleÂ 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "ExampleÂ 15.1.Â A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

<p>Recently I've taken a deeper interest in hardware, including programming

<p>Recently I've taken a deeper interest in hardware, including programming
embedded systems, writing Verilog for FPGA devices, and hardware security
in general. It's a lot of fun to build things, but it can also be a lot of fun
taking things apart or seeing how you can make them fail.</p>
<p>Enter what I've been playing with in my free time for the past week or so: the
Sprint AIRAVE 2.5+.</p>
<p><a href="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front\_side.jpg" title="AIRAVE 2.5+"><img alt="AIRAVE 2.5+" src="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front\_side.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Sprint AIRAVE is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtocell">femtocell</a>. It's used to boost wireless access
in areas where coverage is poor. In short, cellular devices connect to the
AIRAVE as if it were a cellular tower, and the AIRAVE connects to Sprint's
network using a broadband internet connection. From the user perspective,
the calls appear to be using the cellular network (as opposed to something
like WiFi calling), but in reality, the calls are being sent over the broadband
connection to Sprint.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Sometime in the past year, I was contacted by Sprint and notified that after
a certain date, my AIRAVE would no longer be functional, as they were
making changes to the network as part of the T-Mobile merger. That
date has come and gone, so my AIRAVE has been sitting on the shelf
collecting dust. I figured why not see what makes it tick, and maybe find
another use for it. Even if I wind up destroying it in the process, at least
there's a chance of reusing it, rather than just sending it off to the
landfill.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in playing with these, you may be able to pick one up
on eBay or other sites that sell used hardware.</p>
<h2>Board Inspection</h2>
<p>Opening the case and removing the board revealed a large heat sink and a couple
of RF-shielded sections.</p>
<p><a href="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front.jpg" title="Front of circuit board"><img alt="Front of circuit board" src="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/front.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The RF-shielded areas contain the GPS and cellular radio chips. They're not
really important to what I'm trying to do, so I didn't go any further than
looking up the part numbers to identify the chips.</p>
<p>Underneath the heat sink is the CPU (marked in blue) and NAND flash (marked in green).
The CPU is a <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/161/BSC9131-482835.pdf">Freescale BSC9131 PowerPC</a>, and the <a href="https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Macronix/MX30LF1G08AA.pdf">NAND flash</a> holds
128MB. Other chips visible are DDR memory (12 o'clock), a thermal watchdog
(2 o'clock), line drivers (6 o'clock) and an ethernet controller (11 o'clock).</p>
<p><a href="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/cpu\_1\_markup.jpg" title="Circuit board with heat sink removed"><img alt="Circuit board with heat sink removed" src="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/cpu\_1\_markup.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The back of the board doesn't have much to interest us, except that it's very
easy to see some interesting hole patterns in the lower left corner. My understanding
is that the 14-pin arrangement may be a JTAG interface, but I haven't attempted
to verify this. However, it seemed very likely that the 4-pin array would be
a UART interface, so I proceeded with this assumption.</p>
<p><a href="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/back.jpg" title="Back of circuit board"><img alt="Back of circuit board" src="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/back.jpg"></a></p>
<h2>UART Connection</h2>
<p>A quick test of the 4-pin array with a digital multimeter identified the
ground and 3.3v pins.</p>
<p>To make things easier, I soldered a header to the UART interface, and connected
my Saleae logic analyzer.</p>
<p><a href="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae.jpg" title="Saleae logic analyzer connected to UART header"><img alt="Saleae logic analyzer connected to UART header" src="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Opening Saleae Logic 2, configuring the channels, and booting the AIRAVE made it
very easy to identify the TX pin and view the output from the boot process.</p>
<p><a href="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae\_logic.png" title="Saleae Logic 2 program showing UART output"><img alt="Saleae Logic 2 program showing UART output" src="https://billblough.net/images/airave25/saleae\_logic.png"></a></p>
<p>With the UART pinout confirmed, the logic levels weren't really needed anymore
so I switched to using an Adafruit FT232H breakout board as a UART-to-USB adapter
and watched the output using picocom.</p>

<p>The boot output gave a lot of detail about the system, including the CPU and
speed, amount of RAM, flash layout, and Linux kernel version. However, there
was no login prompt, nor did it allow me to stop the Uboot process and get
a Uboot shell. So at this point, all I could do was watch the boot, but not
interact. Fortunately, there are sometimes ways around this, which I'll write
about in my next post.</p>sudo reboot2020-10-10T16:27:57-04:002020-10-10T16:27:57-04:00bbloughtag:billblough.net,2020-10-10:/blog/2020/10/10/sudo-reboot/<hr>

<p>Last year, my intent had been to post monthly updates with details of the F/LOSS
contributions I had made during the previous month. I wanted to do this as a
way to summarize and reflect on what I had done, and also to hopefully
motivate me to do more.</p>
<p>Fast forward, and it's been over a year since my last blog post. So much for
those plans.</p>
<p>I won't go into specific detail about the F/LOSS contributions I've made in the
past year. This isn't meant to be a "catch-up" post, per se. It's more of an
acknowledgment that I didn't do what I set out to do, as well as something
of a reset to enable me to continue blogging (or not) as I see fit.</p>
<p>So, to summarize those contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>As expected, most of my contributions were to projects that I regularly
contribute to, like <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, <a href="https://axis.apache.org/axis2/c/core/">Apache Axis2/C</a>, or <a href="https://www.pwsafe.org/">PasswordSafe</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were also some one-off contributions to projects that I use but am not
actively involved in, such as <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/">log4cxx</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ajventer/pyKAN">PyKAN</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was also a third category of contributions that are a bit of a special
case. I made some pseudonymous contributions to a F/LOSS project that I did
not want to tie to my public identity. I hope to write more about that
situation in a future post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I'm pretty happy with the contributions I've made in the
past year. Historically, my F/LOSS activity had been somewhat sporadic,
sometimes with months passing in between contributions. But looking through
my notes from the past year, it appears that I made contributions every single
month, with no skipped months. Of course, I would have liked to have done more,
but I consider the improvement in consistency to be a solid win.</p>
<p>As for the blog, well... Judging by the most recent year-long gap (as well as
the gaps before that), I'm not likely to start regularly writing posts anytime
soon. But then again, if sporadic F/LOSS contributions can turn into
regular F/LOSS contributions, then maybe sporadic blog posts can turn into
regular blog posts, too. Time will tell.</p>Free Software Activities (August 2019)2019-09-22T17:13:40-04:002019-09-22T17:13:40-04:00bbloughtag:billblough.net,2019-09-22:/blog/2019/09/22/free-software-activities-august-2019/<hr>

<p>Bug <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/932947">932947</a>: file &mdash; The --mime-type flag fails on arm64 due to seccomp</p>
<p>Recently, there was a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2019/07/msg00391.html">message on debian-devel</a> about enabling seccomp
sandboxing for the file utility. While I knew that passwordsafe uses
file to determine some mime type information, testing on my development
box (which is amd64-based) didn't show any problems.</p>
<p>However, this was happening around the same time that I was preparing the
the fix for <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/932626">932626</a> as noted above. Lo and behold, when I
uploaded the fix, everything went fine except for on the arm64 architecture.
The build there failed due to the package's test suite failing.</p>
<p>After doing some troubleshooting on one of the arm64 porterboxes,
it was clear that the seccomp change to file was the culprit. I haven't
worked with arm64 very much, so I don't know all of the details. But based
on my research, it appears that arm64 doesn't implement the access() system
call, but uses faccessat() instead. However, in this case, seccomp was
allowing calls to access(), but <em>not</em> calls to faccessat(). This led to
the difference in behavior between arm64 and the other architectures.</p>
<p>So I filed the bug to let the maintainer know the details, in hopes that
the seccomp filters could be adjusted. However, it seems he took it as
the "final straw" with regard to some of the other problems he was hearing
about, and decided to revert the seccomp change altogether.</p>
<p>Once the change was reverted, I requested a rebuild of the failed passwordsafe
package on arm64 so it could be rebuilt against the fixed dependency
without doing another full upload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I updated django-cas-server in unstable to 1.1.0, which is the latest upstream
version. I also did some miscellaneous cleanup/maintenance on the packaging.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I attended <a href="https://debconf19.debconf.org">DebConf19</a> in Curitiba, Brazil.</p>
<p>This was my 3rd DebConf, and my first trip to Brazil. Actually, it was my
first trip to anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>As usual, DebConf was quite enjoyable. From a technical perspective, there
were lots of interesting talks. I learned some new things, and was also
exposed to some new (to me) projects and techniques, as well as some new
ideas in general. It also gave me some ideas of other ways/places I could
potentially contribute to Debian.</p>
<p>From a social perspective, it was a good opportunity to see and spend time
with people that I normally only get to interact with via email or irc. I
also enjoyed being able to put faces/voices to names that I only see on mailing
lists. Even if I don't know or interact with them much, it really helps my
mental picture when I'm reading things they wrote. And of course, I met
some new people, too. It was nice to share stories and experiences over
food and drinks, or in the hacklabs.</p>
<p>If any of the DebConf team read this, thanks for your hard work. It was
another great DebConf.</p>

<h2>Task 4</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>A military organization has inquired as to whether it would be possible to
spoof messages to the terrorists, making the messages appear to come from the
terror group&#39;s leadership. This capability would be a game-changer in their
efforts to disrupt and disband the organization. Program binaries and keys have
already been distributed throughout the terrorist organization, though, so
achieving this effect must be done only by modifying the message file. Your
mission is to investigate whether this is possible and, if so, provide a
message file that would spoof the following message while making it appear as
though it came from the leadership. The message will be sent to the same
high-ranking member that the message from Task 1 was originally sent to.
The message to encode is, &quot;SENSITIVE MESSAGE: Leadership has arranged a meeting
with the local authorities to discuss partnering opportunities. As a
high-ranking member in our organization, your attendance is requested. Meet at
the city police station at 18:00. Be discreet, and come unarmed as to not draw
attention. Mention the pass code cpspxahyvss2s5101lho at the front desk to be
escorted in.&quot;. Use the template file from Task 3 to encode this message into.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Since it wasn't possible to rely on a modified binary or keys, the only
hope was to find a vulnerability in the existing binary that I could exploit
to override the signature verification. Fortunately, after some time digging
through the disassembly and following execution in gdb, I found just such
a vulnerability.</p>
<p>Due to a bug in the program's bounds checking, it was possible to overwrite the
result of the signature verification, and cause the verification to succeed
for arbitrary signatures.</p>
<p>On a successful call to <code>RSA\_verify</code>, the program would store the value
<code>0x72d499eb</code> at a specific stack offset, as shown below.</p>

<p>Later, the program would copy the signature to a buffer located exactly 128 bytes
before the location where the verification result was stored. Normally this
would cause no problem, particularly since a bounds-checking version of
<code>memcpy</code> was used. However, in this case the destination buffer size was

provided keys and plaintext file, and upload the resulting message file.
Also, the message for this task should be destined to the same recipient as
the message in Task 1 (meaning it should decode in your decoder without any
modifications being necessary) but using the key file provided below.
The message to encode is, &quot;Sir, Good news! We have developed a capability
to encode secret messages to help with OPERATION vq72hp4w2pkw7h28b4gg. We
are ready for our final tasking. VR, Codebreaker 3473469&quot;.
</code></pre></div>
<p>As the task says, in order to build an encoder we need to first understand the
decoder logic. This was definitely the most time consuming part of the entire
challenge, as it involved reverse engineering a significant portion of the
decoder binary. This meant a lot of staring at the program's disassembly and
converting it to an easier-to-work-with representation in C.</p>
<h3>The Decoder</h3>
<p>In order to make sure that I understood the decoder logic correctly, I decided
to actually build a working decoder. This allowed me to verify the correctness
of the logic by comparing my decoder's behavior with that of the decoder
provided in <a href="/blog/2016/04/28/nsa-codebreaker-challenge-2015/">Task 1</a>.</p>
<p>To begin the process, I used <code>objdump</code> to disassemble the binary. This resulted
in over three hundred thousand lines of assembly. Fortunately, the binary had
not been stripped of debug symbols, so function names were included in the
output. This made it easy to ignore the vast majority of the code, and only
focus on functions that weren't related to openssl, curl, or the standard library.
After weeding out all of the various library functions, there were 945 lines of
assembly remaining. It belonged to the following functions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>08049c70 &lt;main&gt;:
0804a120 &lt;get\_file\_contents&gt;:
0804a1e0 &lt;writefunc&gt;:
0804a270 &lt;init\_string&gt;:
0804a2d0 &lt;normal&gt;:
0804a590 &lt;Base64Decode&gt;:
0804a600 &lt;tier2&gt;:
</code></pre></div>
<p>Since the goal of the decoder is to understand the secret message logic, it
wasn't necessary to implement the decoder in the exact same way as the
original as long as it worked the same way when decoding messages. This meant
that I could ignore any code that related to file handling, curl, or the stock
price functionality. Reading through the disassembly, it became apparent that I
could ignore all of the functions listed above except for <code>tier2</code> and
<code>Base64Decode</code>. However, since base64 is well understood, <code>Base64Decode</code> could
be disregarded as well, as it would be straightforward to either
reimplement, or find a library which provides the functionality.</p>
<p>To reverse engineer the remaining function, I systematically read chunks of
the disassembly and annotated them with the equivalent <code>C</code> code.</p>

<p>The result was a decoder that implemented the following (incomplete) pseudocode:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>...
For each line of the message
Start at the end of the line
Read backward until a character that is not a tab or space is found
For each character until the end of the line
if a tab, append 0 to output
if a space, append 1 to output
...
</code></pre></div>
<p>In short, the message was binary encoded using tabs to represent zeros and
spaces to represent ones. Then the message bits were appended to lines
in an innocuous-looking text file.</p>
<p>The output bitstream contained three sections: a 7-byte header section starting
with <code>M</code> and containing the message size, the ID of the recipient, and the
signature size; a message section containing the secret message in cleartext;
and a signature section containing a base64-encoded RSA/SHA224 signature for the
message.</p>
<p>After the initial work to decode the hidden message, it was straightforward to
add the library calls needed to base64 decode the signature and verify it
using OpenSSL</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@host:~/nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_3$ ./decode ../task\_1/tier1\_key.pem ../task\_1/tier1\_msg.txt
\*\*\*\*\*SIGNATURE IS VALID\*\*\*\*\*

<h3>The Encoder</h3>
<p>With the decoder logic in hand, creating the encoder was easy. Partial
pseudocode for the encoder looked like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>...
Create an RSA signature for the message, base64 encode it, and append it to the message
Create a header block with the leading M, the message size, the
recipient id, and the signature size, and prepend it to the message.
For each character of the message
For each bit of the character
if the bit is zero, output tab
if the bit is one, output space
Loop through encoded message
append three bits of the message to each line of the template
if less than three bits remain, append remaining bits
if no more lines in template, append remaining message to one empty
line at the end of the template
...

<p>This is a continuation of <a href="/blog/2016/04/28/nsa-codebreaker-challenge-2015/">my previous post</a> on the NSA Codebreaker Challenge 2015, and covers
the second task in the challenge.</p>
<h2>Task 2</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> Through SIGINT we have collected a new message file - this one appears to
have been sent to a field operative in the terrorist organization that is
of particular interest. A key file for this invidiual was collected
previously and should still be valid. We believe that this message may
contain actionable intelligence, so please report back with the message
contents as soon as possible. This task will require you to figure out how
to bypass the access controls built into the program that limit which
recipient can decode each message.
</code></pre></div>
<p>Running the program with the new message and key produced a new error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~/nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_2$ ./secret-messenger --reveal --action tier2\_msg.txt --symbol tier2\_key.pem
Invalid (failed check 4)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Once again running the program under gdb, it was possible to discover where
in the code the error message was being used. First, I used the process
memory map to get the starting and ending addresses. Then I used gdb's <code>find</code>
command to search for the error message string.</p>

<p>Searching for references to <code>0x0804aacd</code> found nothing. If I were using a
more advanced tool, such as <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA</a>, I could follow the call graph and see
what jumps to that address. Rather than step through the program and watch
for the jump manually, I decided to use gdb's ability to step backwards while
debugging. This allowed me to set a breakpoint on <code>0x0804aacd</code> and run the
program up to that point, then step backwards to see what led there.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/nsa2015/reverse\_debugging.png" alt="The comparison and jump in gdb" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Just prior to the jump was a comparison checking if the value contained in the
<code>ax</code> register was equal to 0x6962. Since the goal of this task is to bypass this check,
the most straightforward solution is to patch out the jmp so it is never taken.
I did this with the <code>hexedit</code> utility, and replaced the 6 bytes that made up the <code>jne</code> instruction
with the <code>NOOP</code> value of 0x90.</p>
<p>However, when using the hex editor to edit the binary, the addressing starts at
zero. So in order to patch in the correct place, it was necessary to calculate
the offset from the beginning of the memory space to the target address
(<code>0x804a7c3 - 0x8048000 = 0x27c3</code>), and then modify the binary at that offset in
the editor.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/nsa2015/hexedit.png" alt="The hexeditor program showing the NOOP bytes" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>After patching the binary, decoding the message worked without errors and showed that the
bypass of the check was successful</p>

<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/">National Security Agency</a> held a reverse engineering
competition for students. It ran from September 1st to December 31st, and
consisted of four tasks. <a href="https://codebreaker.ltsnet.net/2015-results.html">The results page</a> lists the participating schools
and students, along with tasks completed, rankings, and times. I represented
<a href="http://www.cs.fsu.edu/">Florida State University</a> and was able to complete all four tasks in just
under 53 hours.</p>
<h2>Background Story</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> NSA has discovered that the leadership of a terrorist organization is using
a new method of communicating secret messages to its operatives in the
field. Intelligence suggests that each member of the organization is
provided a program that can be used to read the messages, and that a
customized cryptographic implementation is used to generate a
public/private key pair, which is then used to authenticate messages from
leadership to each member.
A copy of the program belonging to a high-ranking operative has been
recovered, along with that individual&#39;s key and a text file believed to
contain a hidden message. At first glance, the program appears to simply
check stock information, but this is likely a ruse to make it appear
innocuous. Your mission is to reverse-engineer this software and develop
capabilities to exploit the secret messaging component. There are 4
different tasks for you to complete, with each increasing in difficulty and
building off the previous task(s).
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Task 1</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> We need your help with decoding the message that we&#39;ve captured. The text
file, key file, and secret messaging program can be found below. The main
objective for this task is to figure out how to decode the message with the
program and report back on your findings.
To complete this task, you will most likely need to analyze the program
binary in order to determine how to trigger the hidden functionality and
decode the secret message.
</code></pre></div>
<p>As stated in the background story, the program appeared to be a simple
stock price query utility:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~/nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./codebreaker3 --help
Help:
--debug true : Show debugging information
--help : Show this help message
--symbol &lt;symbol&gt; : The ticker symbol to reference
--action &lt;action&gt; :
&#39;open&#39; for the days opening price
&#39;low&#39; for the days lowest price
&#39;high&#39; for the days highest price
&#39;last&#39; for the last price
--symbol and --action are required arguments
Stock Information Powered by Yahoo!
</code></pre></div>
<p>And indeed, it seemed to work as such:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~/nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./codebreaker3 --symbol GOOG --action open
&#39;open&#39; info for &#39;GOOG&#39;: 708.26
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first order of business was to discover how to invoke the secret
functionality.</p>
<p>Running <code>strings</code> on the binary "revealed" something interesting - a hidden option! </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> --reveal : Enter secret message mode
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, trying that option produced an error:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~/nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./codebreaker3 --reveal
Failed binary name check
</code></pre></div>
<p>At that point, I decided to step through execution in gdb, in order to see
what was happening. As it turns out, there is a check that the binary name
is exactly 16 characters long</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/nsa2015/basename\_length.png" alt="The basename length check in gdb" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Renaming the binary to be 16 characters long didn't change the error message. So, proceeding
further in gdb with the renamed binary, I found a check that verifies that the
program was invoked as <code>secret-messenger</code></p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/nsa2015/name\_comparison.png" alt="The basename comparison in gdb" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Renaming the binary to <code>secret-messenger</code> was all it took to get further.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./secret-messenger --reveal
Missing required parameter. Run with --help for more info.
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>--help</code> text was the same as before, and the output of <code>strings</code> didn't
show any additional options. Rather than diving back into gdb, I decided to
follow the hunch that the existing options served a purpose in the secret mode
as well. A little trial-and-error was called for.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./secret-messenger --reveal --symbol foo --action bar
Could not open &#39;bar&#39;
access: No such file or directory
</code></pre></div>
<p>So I passed the key file as the action</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./secret-messenger --reveal --symbol foo --action tier1\_key.pem
Could not open &#39;foo&#39;
access: No such file or directory
</code></pre></div>
<p>And also the message file as the symbol</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./secret-messenger --reveal --symbol tier1\_msg.txt --action tier1\_key.pem
Could not open &#39;foo&#39;
Invalid (failed check 1)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Since there was no guarantee that I guessed right the first time, I thought it might be possible
that I had the files matched to the wrong arguments. So I tried swapping them</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code> user@host:~nsa\_codebreaker\_2015/task\_1$ ./secret-messenger --reveal --action tier1\_msg.txt --symbol tier1\_key.pem
\*\*\*\*\*SIGNATURE IS VALID\*\*\*\*\*
Message: Meet at 22:00 tomorrow at our secure location. Come alone, and do not tell anyone - this meeting is sensitive, as leadership will be present. To authenticate yourself, mention the pass code osb4rfmthy5dp22kd7qm at the door.
\*\*\*\*\*SIGNATURE IS VALID\*\*\*\*\*
</code></pre></div>
<p>And bingo! The <code>action</code> argument went with the message file, while the <code>symbol</code> argument went with the key file.</p>
<p>With the message decoded, Task 1 was complete.</p>SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2015 Writeup2016-01-05T17:46:56-05:002016-01-05T17:46:56-05:00bbloughtag:billblough.net,2016-01-05:/blog/2016/01/05/sans-holiday-hack-challenge-2015-writeup/<hr>

<p>In the 2015 <a href="https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com/2015/">SANS Holiday Hack Challenge</a> the goal was to determine the
true purpose of the "Gnome In Your Home" product, as well as "Who" was behind
its development and the details of their dastardly plot. This is a writeup
of my findings and how I arrived at them.</p>
<h2>Part 1 - The packet capture</h2>
<p>The provided pcap file contained a snapshot of the Gnome's traffic. Inspecting
this in <a href="https://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark</a> made it apparent that there was covert communication
traffic masquerading as DNS traffic.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/dns\_cc.png" alt="Viewing the packet capture in Wireshark" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Some basic scripting with <a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/">Scapy</a> made extracting the relevant information
from the traffic pretty straightforward. The results showed commands being
executed on the Gnome via the C&amp;C channel, and an image taken by the Gnome's
camera being sent back to the controlling system.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/snapshot\_CURRENT.jpg" alt="The image transmitted by the Gnome" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<h2>Part 2 - The firmware dump</h2>
<p>The provided firmware file contained a squashfs filesystem that was easily
unpacked by <a href="https://github.com/devttys0/binwalk">binwalk</a>. </p>

<p>The firmware was based on <a href="https://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> and was compiled for ARM. Customized
for use in the Gnome, it contained a <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> web application, a
<a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> instance, and Gnome-specific programs sgdnsc2 and sgstatd.</p>
<p>An examination of the database yielded application credentials stored in
plaintext, including credentials for a regular user account, as well as an
admin account.</p>
<p>Analysis of the web application code yielded several vulnerabilities that could
be used to compromise the SuperGnomes. However, much of the relevant code was
commented out, so the vulnerabilities present in a specific SuperGnome would
depend on which version of the code it was running.</p>
<p>Also found in the firmware was the IP address of the first SuperGnome.</p>
<h2>Part 3 - Finding SuperGnomes</h2>
<p>Accessing the first SuperGnome via a web browser (using the admin credentials
found in the firmware) indicated that there were a total of five SuperGnomes.
Plugging some Gnome-specific information into <a href="https://www.shodan.io/">Shodan</a> quickly led to the
other four, all scattered around the world.</p>

<h2>Part 4 - Hacking SuperGnomes</h2>
<p><strong>SG-01:</strong> For SG-01, no exploits were needed, however. The admin credentials
found in the firmware were enough to access the needed files, including the
gnome.conf, another packet capture, some fuzzy camera images, messages from
"GnomeNet", and a zip file containing the sgstatd program source code.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/SG01\_files.png" alt="The SG-01 file list" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>The packet capture contained a complete SMTP session, from which the email
message could be read. The email contained plot details, and a rough diagram
of the Gnome surveillance network architecture.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/GIYH\_architecture.jpg" alt="The GIYH architecture drawing extracted from the captured email" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>Based on the GnomeNet messages, the fuzzy camera images were evidence of a
software error that caused several camera images to be XORed together.
Conveniently, all of the cameras had been shut off except for the one in the
boss' office, so XORing all of the disabled factory camera images with the garbled
image should produce an image of the boss' office (and maybe even the boss). </p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/camera\_feed\_overlap\_error.png" alt="The fuzzy image recovered from SG-01" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>The sgstatd source code proved useful, since analyzing the source yielded
another vulnerability that could be exploited on the SuperGnomes.</p>
<p><strong>SG-02:</strong> While it was possible to log into SG-02 using the known credentials,
file download was disabled. However, the web application's camera image
viewer contained Local File Include and Path Traversal vulnerabilities, with the
caveat that it also contained an extension check to ensure that only files with
a .png extension could be viewed/downloaded. Fortunately, it was possible to
bypass this by using the settings upload function to create a subdirectory
named .png, and then crafting the path traversal to include our .png
directory in the path when specifying the local file to include.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/SG02\_create\_dir.png" alt="Creation of a directory using the settings upload function" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/SG02\_LFI.png" alt="The LFI vulnerability in action" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>With this, it was possible to download the gnome.conf, another packet capture,
and another factory camera image.</p>
<p>The packet capture contained another SMTP session. In this email, the Gnome
hardware order was being discussed, including ARM-based systems, WiFi adapters,
and other hardware.</p>
<p><strong>SG-03:</strong> On SG-03, the admin credentials used previously did not work at all
-- it wasn't even possible to log in with them. The user credentials worked, but
did not have access to anything useful. However, the authentication routine
was vulnerable to NoSQL injection. Using <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/">Burp Suite</a> to modify form
submissions, it was possible to pass JavaScript into the login form, affect the
DB query, and trick the system in to authenticating as admin even without the
password.</p>

<p>Once logged in, it was possible to download the gnome.conf, another packet
capture, and another factory camera image, all directly from the file download
page.</p>
<p>The packet capture contained another SMTP session. In this email, the evil
plot was revealed - to dress like Santa Claus and rob houses on Christmas Eve!</p>

My Burgling Friends,
Our long-running plan is nearly complete, and I&#39;m writing to share the date
when your thieving will commence! On the morning of December 24, 2015, each
individual burglar on this email list will receive a detailed itinerary of
specific houses and an inventory of items to steal from each house, along
with still photos of where to locate each item. The message will also
include a specific path optimized for you to hit your assigned houses
quickly and efficiently the night of December 24, 2015 after dark.
Further, we&#39;ve selected the items to steal based on a detailed analysis of
what commands the highest prices on the hot-items open market. I caution
you - steal only the items included on the list. DO NOT waste time grabbing
anything else from a house. There&#39;s no sense whatsoever grabbing crumbs too
small for a mouse!
As to the details of the plan, remember to wear the Santa suit we provided
you, and bring the extra large bag for all your stolen goods.
If any children observe you in their houses that night, remember to tell
them that you are actually &quot;Santy Claus&quot;, and that you need to send the
specific items you are taking to your workshop for repair. Describe it in a
very friendly manner, get the child a drink of water, pat him or her on the
head, and send the little moppet back to bed. Then, finish the deed, and
get out of there. It&#39;s all quite simple - go to each house, grab the loot,
and return it to the designated drop-off area so we can resell it. And,
above all, avoid Mount Crumpit!
As we agreed, we&#39;ll split the proceeds from our sale 50-50 with each
burglar.
Oh, and I&#39;ve heard that many of you are asking where the name ATNAS comes
from. Why, it&#39;s reverse SANTA, of course. Instead of bringing presents on
Christmas, we&#39;ll be stealing them!
Thank you for your partnership in this endeavor.
Signed:
-CLW
President and CEO of ATNAS Corporation

<p><strong>SG-04:</strong> The admin credentials found in the firmware allowed login to SG-04,
but as expected, file download did not work. However, file upload was enabled,
and was vulnerable to JavaScript injection. </p>
<p>Once again using Burp Suite, it was possible to modify form submissions to
include malicious JavaScript. In this case, any JavaScript included in the

<p>Files obtained from SG-04 were its gnome.conf, another packet capture, and
another factory camera image.</p>
<p>The packet capture included another SMTP session. In this email, the CEO
discusses her dislike of Christmas, her evil plot, and her motivations with her
therapist. Based on her signature, it becomes apparent that she is none other
than Cindy Lou Who, of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" fame.</p>
<p><strong>SG-05:</strong> While the found credentials allowed login to SG-05, none of the
upload or download functions were active, nor were any of the previous
exploits successful. However, a port scan of SG-05 showed that port 4242 was
open. Based on analysis of the sgstatd source code, SG-05 was likely running
sgstatd on port 4242, and was therefore likely to be vulnerable.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/SG05\_sgstatd.png" alt="The sgstatd interface" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>The earlier analysis of sgstatd revealed a hidden command whose code contained
a buffer size mismatch that could lead to a buffer overflow and arbitrary code
execution.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/SG05\_code.png" alt="The relevant section of the sgstatd program code" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>As an attempt to mitigate buffer overflows, sgstatd employs a stack canary
for the vulnerable function. However, the canary was a constant, so bypassing it
was as simple as ensuring that the canary value was re-copied to the correct
place as part of the exploit payload.</p>
<p>Developing the exploit was mostly straightforward, thanks to some hints from the
challenge instructions. The first hint indicated that stack execution
protection (NX/DEP) was not being used, and checking the sgstatd binary from
the firmware confirmed this. Another hint indicated that ASLR was being used,
and that it might be wise to use a "jmp \*esp" ROP gadget to bypass it.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, it was simply a matter of developing the payload,
finding the ROP gadget offsets, etc. The sgstatd source could be compiled with
symbols and debugged, so much of this was simplified. In addition, the sgstatd
binary from the firmware was compiled for x86 instead of ARM, so that was
useful for finding ROP gadget offsets for the target version of the binary.</p>
<p>The first shellcode attempted was a reverse shell using netcat. The payload
executed successfully on the local system against the locally compiled binary,
and also the firmware binary. However, launching it against the target failed.
At the time, it seemed that a firewall was blocking outbound connections, but
this turned out not to be the case. Eventually the problem was tracked
down to an issue with the shellcode itself. </p>
<p>Since at the time it seemed like there was a firewall problem, a different
approach was tried. Instead of using netcat, the payload was rewritten to
reuse the socket descriptor and open a shell over the existing connection.
This was made more difficult by sgstatd using randomized socket descriptors.
Frequently, this is handled by randomly trying to "brute-force" the socket
descriptor, and eventually succeeding. However, since the socket descriptor
was passed as an argument to an earlier function call, the value was still on
the stack. And since the function calls (and therefore stack layout) are
fairly consistent, it was simple enough to find the descriptor on the stack
with the debugger, calculate the offset relative to EBP/ESP, and then have the
payload retrieve the value using the offset.</p>
<p><img src="https://billblough.net/images/2015-SANS-HH/SG05\_gdb.png" alt="The socket descriptor on the stack" style="width: 100%;"/></p>
<p>All of this worked both locally and against the target, yielding a shell and
the necessary files. Files obtained were SG-05's gnome.conf, another packet
capture, and another factory camera image.</p>
<p>The packet capture contained an IMAP mail session. In this email, the Grinch
was apologizing to Cindy Lou Who for what happened in the past.</p>
<h2>Part 5 - Attribution</h2>
<p>As previously discovered in the email, the culprit is Cindy Lou Who, from "How
the Grinch Stole Christmas", and her plot was to steal from families on
Christmas Eve using burglars dressed as Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Additionally, with all 5 factory camera images, it was possible to XOR them
together with the garbled camera image, producing an image of Cindy Lou Who,
age 62, sitting at her desk.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>Overall, this was a very enjoyable challenge. Not only did it require a good
mix of skills, it was a good opportunity to brush up on old skills and pick up
some new skills at the same time. It also had a fun theme.</p>

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>VLC versions before 2.1.5 contain a vulnerability in the transcode module that
may allow a corrupted stream to overflow buffers on the heap. With a
non-malicious input, this could lead to heap corruption and a crash. However,
under the right circumstances, a malicious attacker could potentially use this
vulnerability to hijack program execution, and on some platforms, execute
arbitrary code.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>This vulnerability was found by fuzzing using <a href="https://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/tools/bff.cfm">CERT's Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)</a>
and a <a href="http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/Divx4-bugs/Ikari\_and\_Rei\_in\_the\_hospital-Shadowcry.avi">sample file from mplayerhq</a>. Testing was initially performed on
Debian Sid (x86) using the VLC version 2.1.2-2+b3 from Debian, and later on
Windows XP 32-bit using VLC version 2.1.3 from upstream.</p>
<p>After some time, BFF produced a <a href="http://billblough.net/files/sf\_49e6f9517c74d73db54fb7baa29d9bed-550-minimized.avi">fuzzed file</a> that caused the following crash:</p>

# CVE-2014-6440: Heap Overflow in VLC Transcode Module

---

*From*: Bill Blough <devel () blough us>

*Date*: Wed, 4 Mar 2015 20:45:33 -0500

---

```

Executive Summary
-----------------

VLC versions before 2.1.5 contain a vulnerability in the transcode module that
may allow a corrupted stream to overflow buffers on the heap. With a
non-malicious input, this could lead to heap corruption and a crash.  However,
under the right circumstances, a malicious attacker could potentially use this
vulnerability to hijack program execution, and on some platforms, execute
arbitrary code.

Remediation
-----------

Prior to being notified of this issue, the VLC team had already made changes to
the 2.2 development branch [0][1][2] that corrects this issue by reinitilizing
the filters when a format change is detected. However, the fixes had not yet
been backported to the 2.1 maintenance branch.

Once notified, the VLC team quickly resolved the issue by backporting the
relevant patches to the maintenance branch [3][4][5]. They also added an
additional check on both the development[6] and maintenance[7] branches for
good measure.

CVE-2014-6440 [8] was assigned to this issue.

Timeline
--------

 2014-04-18: VLC team notified of issue

 2014-04-19: Fixed in VLC repository

 2014-07-06: VLC 2.1.5 maintenance release

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named âSecurity Product of the Yearâ by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmapÂ -vÂ -AÂ *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# CVE-2014-6440: Heap overflow in VLC transcode module

Wed 04 March 2015
by [bblough](https://billblough.net/author/bblough.html)

---

## Executive Summary

VLC versions before 2.1.5 contain a vulnerability in the transcode module that
may allow a corrupted stream to overflow buffers on the heap. With a
non-malicious input, this could lead to heap corruption and a crash. However,
under the right circumstances, a malicious attacker could potentially use this
vulnerability to hijack program execution, and on some platforms, execute
arbitrary code.

## Methodology

This vulnerability was found by fuzzing using [CERT's Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)](https://www.cert.org/vulnerability-analysis/tools/bff.cfm)
and a [sample file from mplayerhq](http://samples.mplayerhq.hu/Divx4-bugs/Ikari_and_Rei_in_the_hospital-Shadowcry.avi). Testing was initially performed on
Debian Sid (x86) using the VLC version 2.1.2-2+b3 from Debian, and later on
Windows XP 32-bit using VLC version 2.1.3 from upstream.

After some time, BFF produced a [fuzzed file](http://billblough.net/files/sf_49e6f9517c74d73db54fb7baa29d9bed-550-minimized.avi) that caused the following crash:

Testing under [valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) showed multiple invalid writes past the end of allocated
heap chunks (heap overflow), and following the execution using [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) confirmed
that this was not a false positive.

## Root Cause

Further investigation narrowed the issue to two functions in
`modules/audio_filter/converter/mpgatofixed32.c`.

In the function `Convert`, this code allocates heap space based on the number of samples,
bits, and channels detected:

```
    size_t i_out_size = p_block->i_nb_samples *
    p_filter->fmt_out.audio.i_bitspersample *
    p_filter->fmt_out.audio.i_channels / 8;

    block_t *p_out = block_Alloc( i_out_size );

```

However, in the function `DoWork`, the samples and channels are detected using
a different method:

```
    struct mad_pcm * p_pcm = &p_sys->mad_synth.pcm;
    unsigned int i_samples = p_pcm->length;
    mad_fixed_t const * p_left = p_pcm->samples[0];
    mad_fixed_t const * p_right = p_pcm->samples[1];
    float *p_samples = (float *)p_out_buf->p_buffer;

    if( i_samples != p_out_buf->i_nb_samples )
    {
        msg_Err( p_filter, "unexpected samples count (corrupt stream?): "
                 "%u / %u", i_samples, p_out_buf->i_nb_samples );
        p_sys->i_reject_count = 3;
        goto reject;
    }

    /* Interleave and keep buffers in mad_fixed_t format */
    if ( p_pcm->channels == 2 )
    {
        while ( i_samples-- )
        {
            //assert( *p_left < MAD_F_ONE );
            //assert( *p_left >= -MAD_F_ONE );
            //assert( *p_right < MAD_F_ONE );
            //assert( *p_right >= -MAD_F_ONE );
            *p_samples++ = (float)*p_left++ / (float)MAD_F_ONE;
            *p_samples++ = (float)*p_right++ / (float)MAD_F_ONE;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        assert( p_pcm->channels == 1 );
        while ( i_samples-- )
        {
            //assert( *p_left < MAD_F_ONE );
            //assert( *p_left >= -MAD_F_ONE );
            *p_samples++ = (float)*p_left++ / (float)MAD_F_ONE;
        }
    }

```

With a sufficiently corrupted input stream, this allows for a situation where
the buffer is allocated to contain one channel of data, but then two
channels of data are written to it, causing the write to overflow the
buffer.

## Remediation

Prior to being notified of this issue, the VLC team had already made changes to
the 2.2 development branch [here](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commit;h=a3a150b91f09620dc0d81c22db591a20faf4b2a5), [here](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commit;h=39a99d25872f64dacd470fda86ba2193a55cda52), and [here](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commit;h=26989ea2d98380eef28843ffa8ca490e8f9d6dae) that corrects this
issue by reinitializing the filters when a format change is detected. However,
the fixes had not yet been backported to the 2.1 maintenance branch.

Once notified, the VLC team quickly resolved the issue by backporting the
relevant patches to the maintenance branch [here](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/vlc-2.1.git;a=commit;h=28bd6670a26bf88c2523b7302e2c22f8ca210bb7), [here](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/vlc-2.1.git;a=commit;h=feca6658b4b84b4bc8b7a08431e811813277d31b), and
[here](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/vlc-2.1.git;a=commit;h=e40a4a1a54be2b69e4e001451f0dd91f3857a976). They also added an additional check on both the
[development](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commit;h=a113b849e428b71813a569021bd10d6974f6621f) and [maintenance](http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc/vlc-2.1.git;a=commit;h=a5bee4c5cf0c8fca0d1ddaf570aeebc78e824b15) branches for good measure.

[CVE-2014-6440](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6440) was assigned to this issue.
