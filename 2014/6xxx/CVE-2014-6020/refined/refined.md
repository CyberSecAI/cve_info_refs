The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6020.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This occurs when applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain.
- Use of untrusted or self-signed certificates without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.
- The attacker can view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Credential stealing.
- Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploiting vulnerable applications over untrusted networks like public WiFi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be on the same network as the targeted Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic.
