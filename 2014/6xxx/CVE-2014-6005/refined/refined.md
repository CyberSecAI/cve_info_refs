The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6005.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means they do not verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root CA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation in Android apps.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, potentially viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential theft or arbitrary code execution depending on the applicationâ€™s functionality.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
