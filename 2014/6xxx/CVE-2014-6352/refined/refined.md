  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2014-6352": {
      "root_cause": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the context of the current user, caused by the way the operating system validates memory usage when OLE objects are accessed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper validation of memory usage when handling OLE objects.",
          "Vulnerable OLE object handling"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted Microsoft Office file containing malicious OLE objects.",
          "Web-based attacks involving specially crafted Office files hosted on a webpage.",
          "Email attachments containing malicious OLE objects."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to create a malicious file or webpage with a crafted OLE object and convince a user to open it or visit the webpage. The attacker would not need to be local to the vulnerable system.",
      "additional_details": [
        "User Account Control (UAC) can display a prompt before the exploit is executed, providing a mitigation if UAC is enabled.",
          "Protected View can reduce risk by opening files from untrusted locations in a restricted mode.",
          "An automated \"Fix it\" solution is available to disable the OLE packager.",
           "The vulnerability was first described in Microsoft Security Advisory 3010060",
           "Observed attacks require user interaction for exploitation."
