How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Vulnerabilities in Windows OLE Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3011443)

Published: November 11, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Object Linking and Embedding ([OLE](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx)). The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying how the affected operating systems validate the use of memory when OLE objects are accessed, and by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 3010060](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/3010060).

For more information about this document, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3011443](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3011443).

## Windows OLE Automation Array Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2014-6332

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers. This update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected operating systems validate the use of memory when OLE objects are accessed, and by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

## Windows OLE Remote Code Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2014-6352

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the context of the current user that is caused when a user downloads, or receives, and then opens a specially crafted Microsoft Office file that contains OLE objects. Microsoft first received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. This vulnerability was first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 3010060](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/3010060.aspx). Microsoft is aware of limited attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability. This update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the affected operating systems validate the use of memory when OLE objects are accessed.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* In observed attacks, User Account Control (UAC) displays a consent prompt or an elevation prompt, depending on the privileges of the current user, before a file containing the exploit is executed. UAC is enabled by default on Windows Vista and newer releases of Microsoft Windows.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a webpage that contains a specially crafted Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website.
* Files from the Internet and from other potentially unsafe locations can contain viruses, worms, or other kinds of malware that can harm your computer. To help protect your computer, files from these potentially unsafe locations are opened in Protected View. By using Protected View, you can read a file and see its contents while reducing the risks. Protected View is enabled by default.

### Workarounds

The following [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* **Apply the Microsoft Fix it solution, "OLE packager Shim Workaround", that prevents exploitation of the vulnerability**

  See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 3010060](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/3010060) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

### FAQ

**Are there additional security issues addressed in this update?**

While the root cause for the vulnerability described in this security bulletin is addressed with the provided security update, defense-in-depth fixes are provided for Microsoft PowerPoint to mitigate the attack initially described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 3010060](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/3010060). These fixes can be found in supported versions of Microsoft PowerPoint respectfully in Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles, [2597972](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2597972), [2878251](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2878251), and [2889936](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2889936).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. For an attack to be successful by sending an email message to a locally logged-on user, the user must open an attachment that contains a specially crafted OLE object. Many different types of attached documents can contain the affected OLE objects. All Office file types as well as many other third-party file types could contain a malicious OLE object.

In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and persuading the user to open the file.

In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a website that contains a PowerPoint file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious website. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Microsoft Windows servers and clients that open specially crafted Microsoft Office data files that contain OLE objects are primarily at risk.
