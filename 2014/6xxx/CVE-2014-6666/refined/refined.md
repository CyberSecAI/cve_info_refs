The provided content is related to CVE-2014-6666.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they do not verify if the certificate is from a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks can be performed.
- Attackers can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential stealing and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploiting insecure or untrusted networks like public WiFi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim device to intercept traffic (MITM).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is widespread across many Android applications.
- A spreadsheet is provided with affected applications and fix information.
- The issue was highlighted by the FTC, who settled charges with Fandango and Credit Karma for similar failures.
- The vulnerability can lead to credential stealing and arbitrary code execution depending on the application's function.
- The vulnerability has been known since at least 2012, although the disclosure and public tracking occurred later.
