The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6818.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means the applications don't verify if the server's certificate is from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation: Applications do not verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain, specifically the certificate provided by the server to ensure it was signed by a trusted CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: Attackers on the same network can intercept, view, or modify network traffic intended to be secured by HTTPS.
- Credential theft: Sensitive information like usernames and passwords can be stolen.
- Arbitrary code execution: Attackers might be able to inject malicious code into the application through the compromised connection, depending on the specific application vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This could be a public WiFi or a compromised network.
- MITM attack: Exploiting the lack of proper SSL certificate validation to intercept traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device to perform a MITM attack.
- Ability to intercept network traffic: The attacker needs the capability to intercept and modify network communications between the application and the server.
