Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-6517:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The StAX (Streaming API for XML) XML parser in the JAXP (Java API for XML Processing) component of OpenJDK incorrectly handles external parameter entities when external entity substitution is disabled. Specifically, it was discovered that the StAX XML parser performs expansion of external parameter entities even when external entity substitution is explicitly disabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core vulnerability is an XXE injection flaw. Due to the parser failing to respect the disable external entities setting, it becomes vulnerable to processing external XML entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:** A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to perform an XXE attack against applications using the StAX parser. This could potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*  **Integrity:** Although not directly mentioned in most sources, some sources do point to the possibility of affecting the integrity of systems due to successful exploitation of this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network by sending a specially crafted XML document.
*   **XML Document Injection:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious XML document to an application that uses the vulnerable StAX parser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.
*  **XML Injection:** The attacker must be able to submit a crafted XML file to the targeted application. No authentication is required for the exploit.
*  **Knowledge of Application Usage:** It is implied that the attacker needs knowledge of an application that is vulnerable to processing malformed XML through this vulnerability.

**Additional Details from Analyzed Content**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Oracle Java SE (5.0u71, 6u81, 7u67, and 8u20) and Java SE Embedded (7u60).
*   The vulnerability is addressed in various Linux distributions (Oracle Linux, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, SUSE).
*   The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher at Red Hat (Florian Weimer).
*   The vulnerability is fixed in IcedTea6 1.13.5 and IcedTea7 2.5.3 and later releases, which are open source projects.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Oracle Java SE versions 5.0u75, 6u85, 7u71 and 8u25.
*   The vulnerability allows an attacker to possibly bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
