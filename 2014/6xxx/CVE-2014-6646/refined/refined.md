The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6646.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This occurs because the applications do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate was provided by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, the applications do not correctly check if the server's certificate is signed by a trusted CA.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, allowing them to view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS. This could lead to credential theft, arbitrary code execution, or other unauthorized actions, depending on the application's function.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to intercept and manipulate network traffic. This can be achieved on a shared network such as a public WiFi.
