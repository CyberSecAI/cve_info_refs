The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6945.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means they do not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root CA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Lack of proper verification of the server certificate during SSL/TLS handshake.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This could lead to the attacker viewing or modifying network traffic that should be encrypted by HTTPS.
- Potential credential stealing.
- Possible arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications, and a spreadsheet is maintained with details about affected applications and available fixes.
- The CERT/CC blog details the methodology used to test for SSL vulnerabilities in Android applications.
- The issue was also the subject of an FTC settlement with Fandango and Credit Karma, highlighting the real-world impact of this vulnerability.
