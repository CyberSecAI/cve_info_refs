The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means they do not verify that the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, the applications do not verify the SSL chain, leaving them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can intercept and potentially modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Depending on the application, this could lead to:
    - Credential stealing
    - Arbitrary code execution
    - Disclosure or modification of sensitive personal information

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker intercepts communication between the vulnerable app and the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device, allowing them to intercept network traffic.
- No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned beyond network access and the ability to perform a MITM attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Android applications.
- The CERT/CC performed dynamic testing using "CERT Tapioca" to identify vulnerable applications.
- The vulnerability is present because applications fail to validate the SSL chain, not because SSL is not implemented at all.
- A spreadsheet of affected applications is maintained by CERT/CC: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing).
- Vendors such as Amazon, Google, Fortinet, PNC Bank and Windstream were notified.
- The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N), indicating high confidentiality and integrity impact.
- The provided information is more detailed than the placeholder CVE description.
