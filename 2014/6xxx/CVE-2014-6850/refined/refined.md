Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6850:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the failure of multiple Android applications to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating over HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper verification of the SSL/TLS certificate chain. This allows an attacker to present a malicious certificate without the application detecting that it is not trusted.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** The absence of proper validation makes applications vulnerable to MITM attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can intercept and view sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS, which was intended to be encrypted.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker could modify the intercepted traffic, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
*   **Credential Theft:** User credentials transmitted by the application can be stolen by the attacker.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In certain scenarios, the attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution by injecting malicious content through the MITM attack.
* The impact varies depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** The primary attack vector is a MITM attack, where the attacker intercepts network traffic between the Android device and the server.
*   **Same Network Position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device, such as a public Wi-Fi hotspot.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the same network as the victim's device.
*   **MITM Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
*   A spreadsheet is maintained that lists the affected applications and their current status.
*   The issue was highlighted by the FTC settlement with Fandango and Credit Karma, which did not implement proper SSL encryption.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC.
