Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6257:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a systemic lack of authorization checks on object methods within the Zope platform, which Zenoss is built upon. The Zope platform maps URLs to a tree of objects, with the final path component acting as a method call on the object. While methods can be protected with the `ZEN_CHANGE_SETTINGS` permission, the default state is for object methods to be accessible. This means many helper methods, not intended to be directly invoked as web endpoints, are not protected, allowing any user with access to the underlying object to invoke them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Access Controls:**  The core issue is that many methods within the application are not adequately protected by access control mechanisms. The default accessibility of object methods is a significant weakness.
- **Unprotected Helper Methods:** Helper methods meant for internal use are directly accessible via web requests, bypassing intended access restrictions.
- **Authorization Bypass:**  The lack of proper checks allows users to execute actions they were not intended to trigger or actions that require higher privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Action Execution:** Attackers can trigger unintended actions within the application, potentially modifying settings, configurations, or data.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can invoke methods that would normally require higher permissions than their account possesses, effectively escalating their privileges within the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Web Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by directly crafting HTTP requests to unprotected helper methods.
- **URL Manipulation:**  By understanding the object tree and method naming conventions, attackers can construct URLs that target these vulnerable methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the Zenoss Interface:** The attacker needs access to the Zenoss web interface with a valid user account.
- **Understanding of Application Structure:**  Some knowledge of the internal structure of the application and how URLs map to object methods is needed to construct the attack.
