Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-6387:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how PHP's `ldap_bind` function handles null bytes within strings passed to it. This function, which is a wrapper around the OpenLDAP C library's `ldap_bind` function, doesn't properly sanitize input strings.
- Specifically, the PHP function does not prevent the inclusion of null bytes in the username or password parameters. When passed to the underlying C function in OpenLDAP, C-style strings are interpreted as being null-terminated. Thus, any characters after a null byte are ignored by the OpenLDAP function.
- MantisBT did not sanitize input strings, allowing a null byte to be included in the password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Null Byte Poisoning:** The primary weakness is the lack of null byte sanitization in the `ldap_bind` function's input strings.
- **Unauthenticated Bind:** When a password containing a null byte is passed, the application's check for non-empty passwords in PHP passes because the PHP string is not technically empty, but the OpenLDAP function receives an empty password, resulting in an unauthenticated bind to the LDAP server.
- **Incorrect Assumptions:** MantisBT incorrectly assumes that a successful bind operation always results from an authenticated bind rather than an anonymous/unauthenticated bind.
- **Vulnerable LDAP Configurations:** The vulnerability is exploitable on LDAP servers that allow unauthenticated binds, notably Microsoft Active Directory. OpenLDAP, by default, disallows unauthenticated binds unless explicitly enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass authentication by inserting a null byte at the beginning of the password. This leads to the attacker successfully logging in as any user, even without knowing the actual password.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows unauthorized access to MantisBT, with the privileges of the targeted user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Manipulated Login Data:** The attacker manipulates the password field during the login process. This could be achieved via a proxy or by modifying the application's code to insert a null byte into the password string.
- **LDAP Bind:** The attack exploits the application's use of PHP's `ldap_bind` function with unsanitized input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access to MantisBT:** The attacker must be able to make requests to the vulnerable MantisBT installation.
- **LDAP Configuration Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know if the target system relies on LDAP for authentication and whether the LDAP server allows unauthenticated binds. The vulnerability is more easily exploited against Active Directory, as it allows unauthenticated binds by default.
- **Ability to Inject Null Byte:** The attacker needs the ability to inject a null byte in the password field. This could be through a proxy tool like proxpy, or modifying the application's code.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involved stripping null bytes from GPC input strings in the `gpc_api.php` file within the MantisBT codebase.
- The vulnerability was present in MantisBT versions <= 1.2.17.
- The fix was backported from the master branch to the 1.2.x branch.
- A subsequent fix was required to address an issue where the stripping of null bytes caused a regression in the `gpc_get_string_array` function due to null values not being handled correctly.
