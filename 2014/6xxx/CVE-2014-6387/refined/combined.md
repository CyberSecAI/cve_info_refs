Thank you.

Will post back here when MantisBT 1.2.18 is released.
Until then, affected systems can apply the patch manually.

Fix system warning in gpc\_get\_string\_array()

[Browse files](/mantisbt/mantisbt/tree/99ada4de031b7cd308438144d3d68178055aef07)

```
The fix for issue #17640 did not consider that the value returned by
gpc_get() is not necessarily an array - it can be the default value
(e.g. null) causing PHP to throw an 'Invalid argument supplied for
foreach()' warning.

Fixes #17967, regression from [215968f](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/215968fa8ff33e327f0600765a5caa24de392cbc)

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,

Subject: CVE request: MantisBT Null byte poisoning in LDAP authentication

Greetings

Matthew Daley reported a Null byte poisoning issue with LDAP
authentication affecting MantisBT <= 1.2.17.

A malicious user can exploit this vulnerability to login as any
registered user and without knowing their password, to systems relying
on LDAP for user authentication (e.g. Active Directory or OpenLDAP with
"allow bind_anon_cred").

Patches are available in [1]; full details on the original issue report
can be found at [2]. Can you please assign a CVE ID to this issue ?

Thank you

| Summary | 0017640: CVE-2014-6387: Null byte poisoning in LDAP authentication | | | | |
| Description | Hi,  I've been doing some research on a security issue that has already been discovered and elaborated on, but where little progress has been undertaken on resolving the underlying causes until recently.  Please excuse the length and form-letter style of this message; it is being sent to a number of affected projects' security contacts. Nevertheless, I have tested your application (details below) and have found that it is susceptible to the issue, hence this message.  The issue is in how some software performs user authentication using LDAP servers in certain configurations. It affects a variety of applications, platforms and programming languages that make use of LDAP; PHP was one of them (up until recently). Since your application uses PHP and has the ability to authenticate users using PHP's LDAP extension, your users may in turn be affected.  My personal opinion is that PHP itself is the component at fault, and not your application. However, MITRE (who assign CVEs, etc.) disagree and suggest that individual applications that make use of PHP's LDAP extension and that are vulnerable to the issue are at fault.  Hence, I am writing this message to your project for two reasons:  1) You may indeed wish to treat the issue as a security vulnerability in your own application and hence handle it via your normal processes.  2) I intend to publically disclose all of my findings in the near future (see below); your application will be listed as one of many I tested that were found vulnerable to the issue. Hence, this message also acts as a heads-up on this future disclosure.  Alternatively, your project might agree with my interpretation of where the issue's fault lies instead of MITRE's, in which case presumably no action would be taken on your part.  A description of the issue itself follows. If you are familiar with LDAP and how the various kinds of binds work, please excuse the verbosity!   ---   Users can authenticate to an LDAP directory server by performing a "bind" operation with it. This allows clients to access restricted information in the directory, perform updates and so on.  Other applications can use this bind operation as a way of allowing users to authenticate to the application, using the LDAP server as a centralized source of account information. In this case they usually do not go on and use the bound connection to perform privileged LDAP operations, but instead simply unbind or close it after noting the bind operation's success.  There are two main methods of bind; simple and SASL. Within the simple method, there are three submethods: anonymous, authenticated, and unauthenticated. See RFC 4513, section 5 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-5>).   * An anonymous bind is performed by providing an empty name and an empty   password. Most applications already ensure that non-empty usernames are   given when handling their untrusted login input, and so this bind method   does not relate to the issue at hand. * An authenticated bind is performed by providing a non-empty name and a   non-empty password. This is the usual form of binding which applications   (intend) to make. * However, an unauthenticated bind is performed by providing a non-empty name   and an *empty* password. An unauthenticated bind results in a success result   being returned from the bind operation, just like if either of the other   forms of bind were successfully performed.   Applications that are using LDAP for user authentication must ensure that only authenticated simple binds are attempted. If not, they may incorrectly assume that the success of a bind operation they initiated was due to a successful authenticated bind being performed even though an unauthenticated or anonymous bind may have actually been performed instead. This is done by ensuring that the username and password used in the bind operation are non-empty.  Most applications correctly check for non-empty passwords as part of handling LDAP-based authentication. Although only anonymous binds are explicitly called out in the PHP documentation for the function that performs the binds in question (ldap\_bind, <http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ldap-bind.php>), many commenters have noted this possible security flaw and have warned others about the need to check for non-empty passwords (i.e. <http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ldap-bind.php#46660>).  However, there is another related, subtle issue:  PHP's LDAP extension provides bindings to the C-based OpenLDAP library, including the ldap\_bind function, to perform LDAP binds. The PHP-side function takes in a LDAP connection object and username (DN) and password strings as arguments, with its semantics being the same as the OpenLDAP ldap\_bind function called with LDAP\_AUTH\_SIMPLE method argument.  PHP passes the PHP string arguments to the OpenLDAP C function - which expects C-style null-terminated strings - by passing a pointer to the PHP string's value data in memory. String values in PHP can contain arbitrary byte values, including the null character (byte value 0x00). If an argument to PHP's ldap\_bind contains such a null byte, no special action is taken, so from the OpenLDAP C ldap\_bind function's point of view, such strings are truncated at the first null byte.  Hence, an attacker can pass a string starting with a null byte as a password when authenticating to an application that uses PHP's ldap\_bind. This will, in many cases, bypass the application's own check for a non-empty password (since the string is non-empty from PHP's perspective), but still appear to be empty to the OpenLDAP ldap\_bind function, leading to an unauthenticated bind being performed against the application's intent. This allows authentication bypass, as the attacker can login as any given user without needing to know their real LDAP password.   ---   I have been testing the susceptibility of many applications, both PHP- and other-language-based, to this issue.  First, one needs an LDAP server that allows unauthenticated binds to be performed. The OpenLDAP server explicitly denies such binds by default as a conscious security choice; see section 14.3.1 of the OpenLDAP server administrators' guide, <http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/security.html#Authentication> Methods: "An unauthenticated bind also results in an anonymous authorization association. Unauthenticated bind mechanism is disabled by default, but can be enabled by specifying "allow bind\_anon\_cred" in slapd.conf(5). As a number of LDAP applications mistakenly generate unauthenticated bind request when authenticated access was intended (that is, they do not ensure a password was provided), this mechanism should generally remain disabled."  However, there is at least one other popular LDAP server that does *not* deny unauthenticated binds: Microsoft's Active Directory. I have been testing with Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard w/ SP1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard, and have verified that unauthenticated binds are fully supported and allowed. Others have verified the same on Microsoft Windows 2003 and Novell NetWare eDirectory Server 8.8.   ---   As mentioned earlier, this has already been discovered and elaborated on earlier, see <https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/csd4875.pdf> and <http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ldap-bind.php#73718> both by Alex Everett, said previous discoverer. Even the aforementioned RFC 4513 calls it out in section 6.3.1 (<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-6.3.1>). However, it appears little has changed since then, until now.  I recently submitted a patch to PHP that causes ldap\_bind to raise an error if null bytes are present in either the username or the password string. Instances of your application that are running on a version of PHP that contains this patch are not vulnerable to the issue, but otherwise are. The details of this patch are as follows:  Affected PHP versions: <= 5.5.11, <= 5.4.27 Fixed PHP versions: 5.5.12, 5.4.28 Fix: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=blobdiff;f=ext/ldap/ldap.c;h=9fe48a03aa04ed57ef752b0aad632b912205545f;hp=9d3a710b6044a60680c60f4480b83d12b9bf1cc2;hb=ad1b9eef98df53adefa0c79c02e5dc1f2b928b8c;hpb=40a931> 6dff6e043b534844b2ab167318250be277 Changelog: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=blobdiff;f=NEWS;h=2d98de7fa0ca4847e04559777da1b97edc5a4625;hp=66f0d05645a7ceefc93840c36a8789d928ce434b;hb=ad1b9eef98df53adefa0c79c02e5dc1f2b928b8c;hpb=40a9316dff6> e043b534844b2ab167318250be277   ---   As mentioned earlier, I have tested your application and have found that it is vulnerable to this issue. The version(s) of your application I tested, including any relevant plugin or extension information, is as follows:  1.2.17  In order to help demonstrate this issue to your project, I have set up a publically-accessible Active Directory server (Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard). You can configure an instance of your application to authenticate using this AD server in order to replicate the issue. The details of this server are as follows:  IP: 54.68.122.145 Port: TCP 389 (default; no encryption) Active Directory domain name: AD Account suffix: @ad.ldap.demo Subtree containing user objects: CN=Users,DC=ad,DC=ldap,DC=demo Bind user DN (to bind with before performing a user search): CN=bindaccount.0eef,CN=Users,DC=ad,DC=ldap,DC=demo Bind user password: passw0rd.9e27 Test user DN (to use the null byte bypass to gain access to): CN=testuser.bcbd,CN=Users,DC=ad,DC=ldap,DC=demo Test user password: passw0rd.8f94  (All the usual Active Directory LDAP settings apply, such as the user login name being given by the "sAMAccountName" attribute, using LDAP version 3, and so on.)  In order to login with null bytes present in user passwords, I suggest the use of a simple HTTP proxy such as proxpy (<https://code.google.com/p/proxpy/>). Here is a plugin for proxpy that changes all instances of the string "NULLBYTE" into URL-encoded representations of null bytes:  -- 8< -- def proxy\_mangle\_request(req): v = req.getHeader('Content-Type') if v and 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' in v[0]: req.body = req.body.replace('NULLBYTE', '%00')  ``` return req ```  -- 8< --  However, for easy testing, it may just be easier to hack your application's login handling code so as to manually inject a null byte at the start of a user's password.  Observe that you are able to login to your application as the "testuser" account with any password, so long as it begins with a null byte.   ---   As mentioned at the start of this message, I intend to post a wrap-up of my findings to various security mailing lists in the near future. I have set a date for this disclosure of 4 weeks from now: Tuesday the 7th of October.  Thank you for reading through this huge message!  (Also, I hate to say it, but just in case: I am happy to be credited on any announcement; just use my name as-is. Cheers!)   * Matthew Daley   EDIT(dregad): removed <> around links and added missing information as per [0017640:0041193](/bugs/view.php?id=17640#c41193 "0017640: [2014-09-09 05:07] mattd") | | | | |

If not, a reference to any public discussion on this topic (e.g. oss-security mailing list) would be nice to have. |

Pretty sure once you've added those commits to 1.2.17 this issue goes.  It's long been an issue in php (and other languages/frameworks) that you can use null bytes to inject in some cases. Our approach for this as everything goes through gpc\_string/gpc\_int etc was to strip out null bytes in gpc\_string with str\_replace( "\0","",$t\_result );  Matt: if you get a few moments (as you've obviously got a readily available framework setup), can you see if this old patch fixes the vulnerability area you are planning on reporting on?  Pretty sure it does as IBM's appscan I believe would try adding null bytes to parameters back in 2011 - however nice approach taking it a step further with the authentication bypass from the anonymous binds. |

Back when it was coded, it stopped possible issues in the LDAP, DB layer and file system. In the case of the file system issues, I believe these are no longer an issue without the patch as we've added additional validation around include/require calls.  Whilst as I say, Mattd's taken the root cause a step further by identifying a specific flaw, the fact we've already done work to avoid this and other vulnerabilities as a catch-all within the code, it would be nice to receive some acknowledgement for that...  Equally, why haven't we followed our normal policy on this (with regards to CVE's)? |

Fix system warning in gpc\_get\_string\_array()

```
The fix for issue #17640 did not consider that the value returned by
gpc_get() is not necessarily an array - it can be the default value
(e.g. null) causing PHP to throw an 'Invalid argument supplied for
foreach()' warning.

Fixes #17967 (ported from 1.2.x)
