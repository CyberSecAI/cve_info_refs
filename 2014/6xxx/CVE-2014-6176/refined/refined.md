- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HTTP import binding in an SCA module always uses the SSLv3 protocol variant, regardless of the SSL protocol setting in the referenced SSL configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system is forced to use SSLv3 which is considered insecure and vulnerable to attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential exposure to attacks targeting the SSLv3 protocol (e.g., POODLE).
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks exploiting the use of SSLv3.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the affected services is needed.
