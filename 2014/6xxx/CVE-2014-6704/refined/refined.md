The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6704.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This occurs because the applications do not correctly verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation, specifically failing to verify the chain of trust.
- The lack of proper validation allows man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to occur, where attackers can intercept and modify data transmitted over supposedly secure HTTPS connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers on the same network can view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Depending on the application, the impact ranges from credential stealing to arbitrary code execution.
- The impact varies based on the application and the data it handles.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where the attacker is on the same network as the victim's Android device.
- Exploitation occurs through the use of a malicious actor intercepting the network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. This can be a public wifi, or other compromised network.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between the Android device and the intended server.
