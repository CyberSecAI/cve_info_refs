Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-6519:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an issue with the class file parser within the OpenJDK Hotspot component. Specifically, there's a missing bounds check when reading `BootstrapMethods` attributes from Java class files.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Bounds Check:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper boundary checks in the Hotspot JVM when processing `BootstrapMethods` attributes. This can lead to memory corruption if a malformed class file is loaded.
*   **Class File Parsing Issue:** The class file parser is vulnerable due to the aforementioned missing bounds check.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** A specially crafted class file could cause memory corruption within the JVM due to the missing bounds check. This might lead to unpredictable behavior or potentially be leveraged for further exploitation, though the content doesn't specify specific avenues
*   **Data Integrity issues:** Oracle's advisory also mentions this vulnerability could impact "integrity",  although it does not elaborate on the nature of such impact.
*   **Partial Integrity Impact:** The CVSS v2 scores from oracle and the CVE descriptions indicate a "Partial" impact on Integrity, meaning the attacker can modify data, but is unlikely to take full control of the system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network**: The vulnerability is network accessible. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability via a crafted class file over a network.
*   **Specially Crafted Class File:**  The attack vector is a malformed class file crafted to exploit the missing bounds check.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker does not need prior authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
*  **Medium Complexity:** The attacker needs to craft a specific class file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to supply the crafted class file** - The attacker needs a way to make the crafted class file reach the vulnerable application, which may involve network access or other methods depending on the context of the affected system.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   **Affected Systems:**  The vulnerability affects Oracle Java SE 7u67 and 8u20, Java SE Embedded 7u60 as well as OpenJDK.
*   **Patches/Fixes:** The provided content includes information about patches for various Linux distributions and Oracle products, which confirms that the vulnerability is addressed via software updates.
*  **CVSS Score:** CVSS v2 base scores provided range from 4.3 to 5, which aligns with the described attack vector and impact on partial integrity.
*   **HP-UX:** The HP bulletin indicates that HP-UX systems running vulnerable versions of Java are also impacted by this CVE.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu's Security Notices mention a fix related to this CVE in their OpenJDK 7 package.
* **Red Hat:** Red Hat's bugzilla includes details on the fix for this CVE in their OpenJDK packages.

In summary, CVE-2014-6519 is caused by a missing bounds check when processing `BootstrapMethods` in class files, which allows a remote attacker to cause partial data modification via specially crafted class file. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication and requires medium effort by the attacker. The provided documents show wide coverage of this vulnerability across multiple operating systems, java runtime environments and platforms including linux, OpenJDK, HP-UX and various Oracle Java releases.
