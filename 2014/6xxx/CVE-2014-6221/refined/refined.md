- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GSKit MSCAPI/MSCNG interface code does not generate cryptographically random data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the improper generation of random data by GSKit when using MSCAPI/MSCNG, resulting in predictability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could use this weakness to gain complete confidentiality and/or integrity compromise.
- **Attack vectors:**  Network based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to exploit the improper random number generation remotely.

This content provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically mentioning the MSCAPI/MSCNG interface as the vulnerable component within GSKit, and the fact that it leads to a lack of cryptographic randomness.
