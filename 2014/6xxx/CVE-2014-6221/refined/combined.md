# Security Bulletin: Vulnerabilities in GSKit affect IBM Rational ClearCase (CVE-2015-0159 and CVE-2014-6221)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

GSKit is an IBM component that is used by IBM Rational ClearCase. The GSKit that is shipped with IBM Rational ClearCase contains multiple security vulnerabilities. IBM Rational ClearCase has addressed the applicable CVEs.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2014-6221](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6221) Random Data Generation using GSKit MSCAPI/MSCNG Interface Code does not generate cryptographically random data. An attacker could use this weakness to gain complete confidentially and/or integrity compromise.

CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVSS Temporal Score: See <http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/98929> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2015-0159](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-0159)

**DESCRIPTION:** An unspecified error in GSKit usage of OpenSSL crypto function related to the production of incorrect results on some platforms by Bignum squaring (BN\_sqr) has an unknown attack vector and impact in some ECC operations.

CVSS Base Score: 2.6

CVSS Temporal Score: See <http://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/#/vulnerabilities/100835> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)

## Affected Products and Versions

Rational ClearCase 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.16, 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.13, and 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.6.

The IBM GSKit is used if ClearCase on Windows platforms is configured to integrate with IBM Rational ClearQuest, Rational Team Concert, or Jira with communication over SSL (https). This applies to any integration using Change Management Interface (CMI), and to non-CMI based UCM-enabled CQ integration via OSLC. If your ClearCase deployment is not using these integrations, or not using SSL with the integrations, then your deployment is not sensitive to this attack. The UCM-enabled CQ integration without using OSLC (SQUID) is not sensitive to this attack.

**CMI and OSLC integrations**

| **ClearCase Windows Client Version** | **Status** |
| --- | --- |
| 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.6 | Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations |
| 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.13 | Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations |
| 8.0 through 8.0.0.3 | Not affected |
| 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.15 | Affected if you use CMI or OSLC integrations |
| 7.1.2 through 7.1.2.8 | Not affected |
| 7.0.x, 7.1.0.x, 7.1.1.x | Not affected |

## Remediation/Fixes

The solution is to upgrade to a fix pack of ClearCase that has a newer GSKit component that corrects these vulnerabilities. Please see below for information on the fixes available.

| **Affected Versions** | **Applying the fix** |
| --- | --- |
| 8.0.1 through 8.0.1.6 | Install [Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 7 (8.0.1.7) for 8.0.1](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039409) |
| 8.0.0.4 through 8.0.0.13 | Install [Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 14 (8.0.0.14) for 8.0](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039407) |
| 7.1.2.9 through 7.1.2.15 | Customers on extended support contracts should install [Rational ClearCase Fix Pack 17 (7.1.2.17) for 7.1.2](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg24039405) |

## Disclaimer

Review the [IBM security bulletin disclaimer and definitions](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6610583#disclaimer) regarding your responsibilities for assessing potential impact of security vulnerabilities to your environment.

## Internal Use Only

**Might be an IHS fix to announce too?**

**If so:**

**Server fixes (for CCRC WAN server):**

Install a fix to IBM HTTP Server if you use SSL on your WAN server and you use IBM HTTP Server version 8 or higher. You need the fix for APAR XXXX. Consult IHS [security bulletin 1676092](http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21676092) for the details of the fix.
