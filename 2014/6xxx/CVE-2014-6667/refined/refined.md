The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6667.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- The attacker can view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Possible outcomes include credential stealing or arbitrary code execution, depending on the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Exploitation occurs when the attacker is on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided spreadsheet (which is not directly accessible here) contains a list of affected applications and their corresponding fix information.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating affected apps, avoiding untrusted networks (like public WiFi), and if possible using web browser to access resources instead of the app.
- CERT Tapioca was used to test the applications for SSL vulnerabilities.
- A large number of applications were found to have this vulnerability.
