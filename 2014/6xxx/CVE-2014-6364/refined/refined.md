- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to Microsoft Office improperly handling objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. This leads to a use-after-free condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Office.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could install programs, view, change or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Email attack scenario**: An attacker sends a specially crafted file to a user and convinces the user to open the file.
    - **Web-based attack scenario**: An attacker hosts a website that contains a malicious file to exploit the vulnerability. Compromised websites and websites that host user-provided content could also contain malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince the user to open a specially crafted file in an affected version of Microsoft Office either through email or a website.
