## Vulnerability in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (3017349)

Published: December 9, 2014 | Updated: December 19, 2014

**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a specially crafted file is opened in an affected edition of Microsoft Office. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Important\*\*\*\*for all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Office 2013, and Microsoft Office 2013 RT. For more information, see the **Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Vulnerability Information** section for the specific vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Information

## Microsoft Office Component Use After Free Vulnerability - CVE-2014-6364

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the context of the current user that is caused when Microsoft Office does not properly handle objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Systems where affected Microsoft Office software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that contains a file that is used to attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file in an affected version of Microsoft Office software.

Microsoft received information about the vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.

### Mitigating Factors

The following [mitigating factors](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) may be helpful in your situation:

* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through email. For an attack to be successful, a user must open or preview an attachment that is sent in an email message or click a link contained inside an email message.
* In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view attacker controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs website.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. Customers whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than those who operate with administrative user rights.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any [workarounds](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/dn848375.aspx) for this vulnerability.
