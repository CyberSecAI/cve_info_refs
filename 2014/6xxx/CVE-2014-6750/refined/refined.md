The provided content is related to CVE-2014-6750.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This occurs because they do not verify if the certificate provided by the site was issued by a trusted root certificate authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation in Android applications
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
- Exposure of network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS
- Potential for credential theft and arbitrary code execution
- The specific impact varies depending on the application and the data it handles.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker positioned on the same network as the Android device.
- Untrusted networks such as public WiFi, which are susceptible to MITM attacks

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was identified through dynamic testing using CERT Tapioca.
- A significant number of Android applications were found to be vulnerable
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by updating the affected applications and avoiding untrusted networks.
- The CERT/CC maintains a spreadsheet listing vulnerable applications, which is continuously updated with fixes, testing notes, etc.
- The issue was publicly known since 2012-10-16
