      "details": "The commit fixes a heap overflow vulnerability in the `ec_postgresql.c` file. The vulnerability is triggered when the length of the password received from the server is not handled properly. Specifically, the code used `strncpy` and then null-terminated, while the `length` was decremented after `strncpy`, which may lead to out-of-bounds write if `length - 4` was greater than 65, or to a negative length when checking the condition, allowing a bypass to the sanitization. The fix uses `snprintf` which mitigates the overflow by limiting the copy size based on the `length` parameter. The vulnerability is located within the `dissector_postgresql` function when handling clear-text responses from a PostgreSQL server."
