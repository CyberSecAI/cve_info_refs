Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6334:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from Microsoft Word improperly handling objects in memory while parsing specially crafted Office files. This improper handling can corrupt system memory, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper memory management when parsing specially crafted Office files.
- The specific weakness is related to "Bad Index," implying an issue with array or memory indexing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new user accounts.
- Users with limited rights are less affected, but still at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted file to a user, convincing them to open it.
- **Web-based:** An attacker hosts a website with a malicious Office file. They must then convince the user to visit the site and open the file. Compromised or user-content hosting websites may also be used.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious Office file that exploits the "Bad Index" vulnerability.
- Ability to deliver the file to a target user, either via email, website or other means.
- Requires user interaction, where the user must open the malicious file.
