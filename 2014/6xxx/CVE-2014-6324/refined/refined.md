Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-6324:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to a failure in Microsoft Windows Kerberos KDC implementations to properly validate signatures on Kerberos service tickets. This improper validation allows for certain aspects of a Kerberos service ticket to be forged.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Signature Validation:** The Kerberos KDC does not correctly verify the signatures of Kerberos service tickets, making it possible to forge them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker with valid domain credentials can exploit the vulnerability to elevate their privileges from a regular domain user to a domain administrator.
- **Domain Compromise:** With domain administrator privileges, the attacker can compromise any computer in the domain, including domain controllers.
- **Impersonation:** The attacker can impersonate any user on the domain, including domain administrators.
- **Data and System Manipulation:** Attackers can install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts on any domain-joined system.
- **Access any Resource:** Attackers can access any resource on the network with the identity of a domain administrator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Forged Kerberos Ticket:** An attacker with valid domain credentials sends a forged Kerberos ticket to the KDC that claims the user is a domain administrator.
- **Network Access:** The vulnerable Kerberos KDC component is accessible remotely to users with domain credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Domain Credentials:** The attacker must have valid domain credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker must be able to communicate with the Kerberos KDC.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was being actively exploited in limited, targeted attacks at the time of the bulletin's release.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the signature verification behavior in the Windows Kerberos implementation.
- Systems running Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2 were deemed to be critically impacted by this vulnerability.
- Systems running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, were given the update on a defense-in-depth basis.
- There were no known workarounds available at the time of the security bulletin's release.
