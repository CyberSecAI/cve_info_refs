- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could execute arbitrary script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website, potentially leading to stealing of the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted URL is used to inject malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to entice a user to click on the malicious URL. The attacker also needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious script.
