The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6827, which describes improper SSL certificate validation in multiple Android applications.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. They do not verify if the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Lack of proper verification of the SSL chain.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Ability to view or modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
- Potential for credential theft.
- Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploiting untrusted networks like public Wi-Fi.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs the capability to perform a MITM attack by intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple Android applications.
- The CERT/CC blog details the dynamic testing methodology used to identify the affected apps using "CERT Tapioca".
- The document provides a link to a spreadsheet which details the affected applications, fixes and manual testing notes
- The document also mentions that the FTC settled charges with Fandango and Credit Karma in March 2014 for similar failures in secure transmission of sensitive information.
- The document provides links to relevant articles discussing Android SSL vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N).
