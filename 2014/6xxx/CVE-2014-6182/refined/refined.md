Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6182:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a file path traversal issue within the export function of IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) Process Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **File Path Traversal:** The export function in IBM BPM Process Center fails to properly validate user-supplied file paths. This allows an attacker to craft a URL with a malicious file path, potentially accessing files outside the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive File Download:** Successful exploitation can lead to the download of sensitive files from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URL:** An attacker crafts a URL with a manipulated file path, which is then used to invoke the vulnerable export function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to invoke the export function and be able to craft a URL with a malicious file path. This might require some level of access to the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Business Process Manager (Standard, Express, and Advanced) in versions 8.0.x and 8.5.x.
- A fix is available via APAR JR51234 (and JR52424 for version 8.0.1.3). The fix implements input validation to prevent arbitrary file retrieval.
