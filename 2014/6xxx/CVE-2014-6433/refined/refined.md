Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient parameter validation within the `gpExec` component of the GoPro HERO 3+. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the `c1/c2` parameters are set to "start," and the `a1/a2` parameters are not properly validated.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization/validation of `a1/a2` parameters passed to the `gpExec` component when `c1/c2` are set to "start".
    *   The `gpExec` component allows execution of arbitrary files, if provided through the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target device (GoPro HERO 3+). This could lead to complete compromise of the device.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network, and does not require authentication
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a network position where they can send requests to the vulnerable GoPro HERO 3+ device. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
