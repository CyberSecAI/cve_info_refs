Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-6296:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Affected Component:** TYPO3 extension `wec_map`

**Affected Versions:** 3.0.2 and all versions below

**Root Cause:** The extension is vulnerable to XSS attacks. This usually arises from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before including it in web page output.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages rendered by the vulnerable extension. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the website
    *   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious code through input fields that are not properly sanitized or encoded. This could happen via parameters in a URL, form inputs, or potentially other methods where user-supplied data is used to generate the map output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
   *  The attacker does not require any special privileges, potentially even a guest user could trigger the vulnerability.
   *  The attacker requires the ability to inject malicious scripts through some input mechanism which is then rendered on the page using the vulnerable extension.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also mentions a separate SQL Injection vulnerability (CVE-2014-6295) within the same `wec_map` extension.
*   The fix is to update the `wec_map` extension to version 3.0.3.
*   The extension authors are credited for identifying the vulnerabilities.
