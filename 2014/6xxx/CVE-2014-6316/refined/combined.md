# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named ‚ÄúSecurity Product of the Year‚Äù by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap¬†-v¬†-A¬†*targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (‚ÄúNetwork Mapper‚Äù) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the ‚Äúinteresting ports
table‚Äù.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example¬†15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example¬†15.1.¬†A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

# RE: CVE-2014-6316: URL redirection issue in MantisBT

```
In addition, the credit information for this report again appears to be not state the facts correctly. The issue with
?return= was something that I've previously complained about, and the development team chose not to fix at the time.

The CVE indicator of 2014 makes it appear that the vulnerability was first identified in 2014, but in fact, it's one
that's been known about since a lot earlier - but previous developers argued not to fix I believe (I'll need to pull
out a old HDD and go for chat logs to confirm).

For example, I have test web requests stored demonstrating this issue since at least April 2013
(<http://tinypic.com/r/k0pee/8>) , and I believe that actually the identification of this issue pre-dates this.

Therefore, I don‚Äôt believe it is correct to state that the issue was first reported by ‚ÄúMathias Karlsson‚Äù in May 2014,
when it was identified as an issue prior to April 2013.

Equally, I don‚Äôt believe that putting in the description ‚ÄúPaul Richards also found another redirection issue in
permalink_page.php, which turned out to have the same root cause.‚Äù is a valid indication of the issue - in terms of the
?return parameter, Mantis used the same functionality in around 4-5 pages.

In addition, whilst I did state that I would leave testing of the fix to someone else, the final fix for this issue
looks rather similar to the proposal fix I suggested for further testing of:

[23:16:46] <paulr>          if ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>' . preg_quote( $t_path, '@' ) . ')' . $t_pattern . '$@',
$t_url, $t_matches ) ) {

[23:16:46] <paulr>                  $t_type = 1;

[23:16:46] <paulr> -        } else if ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>' . preg_quote( $t_short_path, '@' ) . ')' . $t_pattern
. '$@', $t_url, $t_matches ) ) {

[23:16:46] <paulr> +        } else if ( $t_short_path != '' && ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>' . preg_quote( $t_short_path,
'@' ) . ')' . $t_pattern . '$@', $t_url, $t_matches ) ) ) {

[23:16:46] <paulr>                  $t_type = 2;

[23:16:46] <paulr>          } else if ( preg_match( '@^(?P<path>)' . $t_pattern . '$@', $t_url, $t_matches ) ) {

[23:16:46] <paulr>                  $t_type = 3;

[23:16:46] <paulr>          }

[23:16:46] <paulr>

[23:16:57] <paulr> not directly related or well

[23:17:07] <paulr> i'm wondering if the above would be correct or not ;p

Subject: [oss-security] CVE-2014-6316: URL redirection issue in MantisBT

Greetings,

Please update CVE-2014-6316 with the information below

Description:

A bug in the URL sanitization routine allows an attacker to craft an URL that can redirect outside of the MantisBT
instance's domain when the software is installed at the web server's root.

e.g.  <<http://example.com/login_page.php?return=http://google.com>>
<http://example.com/login_page.php?return=http://google.com> will redirect to Google.

Affected versions:

=> 1.2.0a3, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:

1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:

See Github [1]

Credit:

Redirection in login_page.php was first reported [3] by Mathias Karlsson

( <<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>> <http://mathiaskarlsson.me>) as part of Offensive Security's bug bounty program [4]; issue
was also independently discovered and reported by Ryan Giobbi who made the original CVE request [2], Shahee Mirza [5]
and Alejo Popovici [6].

Paul Richards also found another redirection issue in permalink_page.php, which turned out to have the same root cause.

The issue was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).

```
The fix for issue #17648 failed to correct all cases of redirection.

Alejo Popovici discovered that the regex checking for URLs pointing to
other domains considered an URL with a single '/' as local, allowing
redirection e.g. to http:/google.com on certain browsers.

Fixes #17997 ([CVE-2015-1042](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-63qw-955w-2x9f "CVE-2015-1042"))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Fix URL redirection issue in login\_page.php

```
The fix for issue #17648 failed to correct all cases of redirection.

Alejo Popovici discovered that the regex checking for URLs pointing to
other domains considered an URL with a single '/' as local, allowing
redirection e.g. to http:/google.com on certain browsers.

Fixes #17997 ([CVE-2014-6316](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gr3x-2r26-g8jg "CVE-2014-6316"))

Fix URL redirection issue in login\_page.php

```
When Mantis is installed at the web server's root, $g_short_path is set
to '/'. string_sanitize_url() removes the trailing '/' from the short
path, which causes the URL to be incorrectly categorized as "type 2",
thus allowing cross-site redirection to occur.

By making checking that the short path is not empty before setting URL
as type 2, we ensure that we categorize it as type 3, which then forces
the function's return value to 'index.php'

Fixes #17648 ([CVE-2014-6316](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gr3x-2r26-g8jg "CVE-2014-6316"))

Subject: CVE-2014-6316: URL redirection issue in MantisBT

Greetings,

Please update CVE-2014-6316 with the information below

Description:

A bug in the URL sanitization routine allows an attacker to craft an URL
that can redirect outside of the MantisBT instance's domain when the
software is installed at the web server's root.

e.g. <http://example.com/login_page.php?return=http://google.com> will
redirect to Google.

Affected versions:
=> 1.2.0a3, <= 1.2.17

Fixed in versions:
1.2.18 (not yet released)

Patch:
See Github [1]

Credit:

Redirection in login_page.php was first reported [3] by Mathias Karlsson
(<http://mathiaskarlsson.me>) as part of Offensive Security's bug bounty
program [4]; issue was also independently discovered and reported by
Ryan Giobbi who made the original CVE request [2], Shahee Mirza [5] and
Alejo Popovici [6].

Paul Richards also found another redirection issue in
permalink_page.php, which turned out to have the same root cause.

The issue was fixed by Damien Regad (MantisBT Developer).

- Add assertion to check string_sanitize_url() when $g_short_path = '/'
  This is a bit of a hack, but it gets the job done
- Add test case for login page URL redirection issue #17648

Fix URL redirection issue in login\_page.php

```
When Mantis is installed at the web server's root, $g_short_path is set
to '/'. string_sanitize_url() removes the trailing '/' from the short
path, which causes the URL to be incorrectly categorized as "type 2",
thus allowing cross-site redirection to occur.

By making checking that the short path is not empty before setting URL
as type 2, we ensure that we categorize it as type 3, which then forces
the function's return value to 'index.php'

Fixes #17648 ([CVE-2014-6316](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gr3x-2r26-g8jg "CVE-2014-6316"))

I'm a bit surprised, because the issue is not reproducible on this tracker, and this part of the code has not changed since 1.2.9. As a side note, I strongly recommend you upgrade to the latest version (1.2.17 at the moment)  We actually sanitize the return URL [1], to prevent just that scenario you describe.  [1] <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/blob/master-1.2.x/login_page.php#L33> <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/blob/master-1.2.x/core/string_api.php#L233>  Was the MantisBT source code modified in any way ? |

My apologies but I might have got the version # wrong. I grabbed it from here <http://www.turnkeylinux.org/mantis>. I didn't change the source. |

| [dregad](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=17784)   [dregad](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=17784)  2014-09-12 10:48  developer ¬†  [~0041212](view.php?id=17648#c41212 "Direct link to note") | According to that link, they are using the latest debian wheezy package, which seems to be a patched 1.2.11 version [1].  That version does not redirect outside of MantisBT, therefore I can only assume that it's a problem specific to either the debian package (not maintained by us, and actually not maintained at all apparently [2]), TurnKeyLinux, or possibly your local setup.  In any case, if you really want a CVE for this, you should first make sure that the issue is truly caused by MantisBT. As far as I can tell, it is not the case.  Based on this, I'll resolve the issue as Unable to reproduce for now, feel free to reopen if you can demonstrate the contrary.  As a side note, considering how simple it is to setup Mantis, I would strongly suggest that you ditch the outdated debian package, and install 1.2.17 manually.  [1] <https://packages.debian.org/source/wheezy/mantis>. [2] <https://packages.qa.debian.org/m/mantis.html> "This package is neither part of unstable nor experimental. This probably means that the package has been removed (or has been renamed). Thus the information here is of little interest ... the package is going to disappear unless someone takes it over and reintroduces it into unstable." |

I have already contacted the mitre folks to get a CVE, but I understand that you only want to support code you wrote.  Here is what it looks like <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_IuCmL7vzZZcnBqWGdZTDg3STQ/edit?usp=sharing>  I'll give the newest version of mantisdb a try |

| [dregad](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=17784)   [dregad](https://mantisbt.org/bugs/view_user_page.php?id=17784)  2014-09-15 19:50  developer ¬†  [~0041224](view.php?id=17648#c41224 "Direct link to note") | Tonight I installed a VM with the TurnKeyLinux/Mantis image and I could reproduce the problem as follows:   1. login to Mantis 2. go to <http://192.168.1.128/login_page.php?return=http://www.google.com>   It would appear that string\_sanitize\_url() does not work properly when Mantis is installed at the root, and returns the URL as-is instead of defaulting to index.php.  So I take back what I said about this being a bug of TKL or the Debian package.  Please let us know the CVE number when you get it. |

Not sure what Mitre's policy is on this, but I believe the original reporter of the original issue should be the one credited for the vulnerability (with a reference to others finding it if necessary). |

Fix URL redirection issue in login\_page.php

```
When Mantis is installed at the web server's root, $g_short_path is set
to '/'. string_sanitize_url() removes the trailing '/' from the short
path, which causes the URL to be incorrectly categorized as "type 2",
thus allowing cross-site redirection to occur.

By making checking that the short path is not empty before setting URL
as type 2, we ensure that we categorize it as type 3, which then forces
the function's return value to 'index.php'

Fixes #17648 ([CVE-2014-6316](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gr3x-2r26-g8jg "CVE-2014-6316"))
