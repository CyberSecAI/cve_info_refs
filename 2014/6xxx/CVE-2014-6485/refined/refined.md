The provided content is a Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA) that lists multiple CVEs affecting Oracle Java SE Development Kit and Runtime Environment. CVE-2014-6485 is among the listed vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerabilities exist within Oracle's Java SE Development Kit and Runtime Environment. The document doesn't give a root cause for each CVE but states that multiple vulnerabilities exist.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple vulnerabilities are present in Oracle JRE/JDK, as detailed in the listed CVEs (including CVE-2014-6485). The description mentions the ability to execute arbitrary code, disclose, update, insert, or delete certain data.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, data disclosure, data modification, or data deletion. This could allow a context-dependent attacker to gain control of the system or compromise sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** The advisory does not specify specific attack vectors but indicates a "context-dependent" attacker, implying that the method of exploitation would depend on the specific vulnerability being exploited and the environment where Java is running. Given the nature of Java, these could potentially include malicious web pages, compromised Java applets, or other vectors that execute Java code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute the vulnerable Java code, either directly or indirectly, within a vulnerable Java environment. The advisory notes that it is "remotely exploitable".
