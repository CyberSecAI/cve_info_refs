  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-6311",
      "description": "The `generate_doxygen.pl` script in ACE (Adaptive Communication Environment) versions before 6.2.7+dfsg-2 creates predictable filenames in the `/tmp` directory. This vulnerability allows attackers to gain elevated privileges.",
      "root_cause": "The `generate_doxygen.pl` script creates temporary files in the `/tmp` directory using a predictable filename pattern. The filename is constructed using the current process ID (`$$`) and a counter (`$i`), making it relatively easy for an attacker to predict the filename.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",
        "Predictable filename generation",
        "World-writable directory usage for temporary files"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite existing files or create new files with elevated privileges. This could lead to various forms of privilege escalation and potentially compromise the system.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Local access to the system",
            "Exploitation of the predictable file names during build process"
        ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Local access to the system",
        "Ability to run code that can create files in /tmp with predicted names"
      ],
      "additional_details": [
        "The vulnerable code is located in `bin/generate_doxygen.pl` at line 177.",
           "The filename pattern is `/tmp/".$i.".".$$.".doxygen`.",
        "The vulnerability exists because the script does not use a cryptographically secure method to generate the temporary filename, making it predictable."
