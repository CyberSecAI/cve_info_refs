The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6893.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS connections. This means they don't verify if the certificate presented by the server is signed by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Improper SSL certificate validation. Specifically, the applications do not verify the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure the server's certificate is trusted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker on the same network can intercept and modify network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
*   Credential stealing: Attackers can steal usernames and passwords if they are transmitted through vulnerable connections.
*   Arbitrary code execution: In some cases, attackers could inject malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based: An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device to perform a MITM attack. This can be a public WiFi network or any network the attacker can control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network access: The attacker must be on the same network as the victim's Android device.
*   MITM capability: The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the device and the server.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects a large number of Android applications.
*   The CERT/CC performed dynamic testing on over 1 million android apps, finding that over 23,000 had failed the SSL validation tests
*   A spreadsheet is maintained with the list of vulnerable apps.
*   The issue stems from developers not following secure coding practices for handling SSL/TLS connections.
