Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-6158:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a file path traversal issue within the file upload functionality of IBM Workload Deployer and IBM PureApplication System.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core weakness is the lack of proper input validation during file uploads. This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths and potentially write files to arbitrary locations within the server's file system.
- File path traversal vulnerability, which is a type of directory traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to server compromise.
- It also creates a potential for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of the affected IBM products.
- An attacker can craft a malicious file path within a file upload request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to upload files to the vulnerable systems. This likely involves having some form of access to the affected applications.
- No other specific capabilities are mentioned beyond having upload access.

**Affected products and versions:**
- **IBM Workload Deployer:** V3.1.0.7 and later.
- **IBM PureApplication System:** V1.0 and later fix packs, V1.1 and later fix packs, and V2.0 and later fix packs.

**Fixes:**
