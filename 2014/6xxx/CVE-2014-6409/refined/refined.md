  "CVE-2014-6409": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "M/Monit is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). It is possible to reset the password of any user account (admin/user) on the system without knowing the current password due to a missing password change verification mechanism.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, specifically missing a password change verification mechanism.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
       ],
      "impact": "An attacker can reset the password of any user account, including admin accounts, leading to account hijacking.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that sends a POST request to the M/Monit server to update a user's password. When a victim visits this page, their browser automatically sends the request, allowing the attacker to change the password without the victim's knowledge or consent."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious webpage or otherwise trigger the crafted request on the victim's browser. No prior authentication is required by the attacker."
