- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM WebSphere Application Server Administrative Console is vulnerable to clickjacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability arises from the server not properly protecting against clickjacking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can hijack the victim's click actions or launch other client-side browser attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker persuades a victim to visit a malicious website, then sends a crafted HTTP request to hijack clicks on the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and be able to persuade the victim to visit it.
