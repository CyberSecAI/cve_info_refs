  "CVE-2014-6619": {
    "Description": "The provided content describes a Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the PizzaInn Project (Restaurant Script) application.",
    "Root cause": "The application stores user-supplied input without proper sanitization in the database, specifically during the registration process.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Stored XSS"
    ],
    "Impact": "When an administrator views new sign-ups, the stored XSS code executes in their browser, potentially leading to malicious actions within the administrator's session.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves submitting malicious code through the registration form, which then gets stored in the database.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to register on the affected application. No special privileges are needed for the attack itself, although access to the administrator panel is required for the execution of the XSS payload."
