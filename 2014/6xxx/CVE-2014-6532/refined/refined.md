Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2014-6532:

**1. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

- The root cause of CVE-2014-6532 is described as an "unspecified vulnerability" within the Deployment component of Oracle JDK. This indicates a flaw in the handling of deployment-related functions. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed in the analyzed content, but it is tied to issues fixed in Oracle's 6u85, 7u71, and 8u25 releases.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Unspecified Vulnerability:** The documents repeatedly mention an "unspecified vulnerability," indicating a lack of specific technical details about the flaw itself.
-   **Deployment Component:** The vulnerability is located within the Deployment component of the Oracle JDK, which deals with the installation, management, and use of Java applications.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources. This implies attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, modify data, or cause a denial-of-service condition.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers.
-   **Context-Dependent:** The specific attack vector is unknown, but it is related to functions within the Deployment component.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The documents suggest the vulnerability could be easily exploited by remote attackers without needing to authenticate.
-   **Exploit Complexity:**  Some sources indicate a medium-level attack complexity for this vulnerability which indicates that some specialized technique may be required for successful exploitation.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Software:**
    *   Oracle Java SE 6u81, 7u67, and 8u20
    *   IBM Java versions are also affected, as they are based on Oracle JDK.
    *   Java SE Embedded 7u60.
*   **Red Hat's Perspective:** Red Hat categorizes this as a "Critical" or "Important" severity issue within their advisories, based on the potential for remote, unauthenticated arbitrary code execution.
*   **Mitigation:** Disabling or upgrading the affected JDK to versions 6u85, 7u71 or 8u25 is the main recommendation. Also, disabling SSLv3 (related to CVE-2014-3566, which is often bundled with this patch) is advised.
*   **Vendor Response:** IBM notes the vulnerability as 'unspecified' and provides fixed versions of their JDK implementation.

**Summary of CVE-2014-6532:**

-   **Root Cause:** An unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component of Oracle JDK
-   **Vulnerabilities:** Unspecified, leading to potential complete compromise.
-   **Impact:** Remote code execution, information disclosure, data corruption, denial of service.
-   **Attack Vector:** Remote, with possible medium complexity
-   **Required Position:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker

**Note:** While the content mentions other CVEs (e.g., CVE-2014-3566, CVE-2014-3065 etc.), they are often discussed in the context of broader security updates, and the primary focus of the analyzed content, as it relates to CVE-2014-6532, is the unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component and its potential for remote compromise.
