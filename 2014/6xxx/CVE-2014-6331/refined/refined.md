Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6331:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a failure in Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) to properly log off a user. Specifically, the logoff process does not fully clear the user's session, leaving it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Logoff:** The primary weakness is that the AD FS logoff process does not completely invalidate the user's session, potentially leaving session data accessible. This leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to information that the user had access to during their previous session by reopening the application in the browser immediately after the legitimate user has logged off. The attacker will not be prompted for credentials since the session is not properly terminated.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Browser Re-opening:** The attack vector involves reopening an application in the browser shortly after a user has logged off from it, before the session is properly cleared or expired.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be able to act within a short timeframe after the user logs off.
- **Access to the Same Browser:** The attacker must be able to access the same browser or device where the user had an active AD FS session.
- **Timing:** The attacker must be able to reopen the application within a timeframe where the session is still active and accessible.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects AD FS 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0 running on various versions of Windows Server (2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2).
- No mitigations or workarounds were identified.
- The fix involves ensuring that the logoff process properly logs off the user, which invalidates the session.
- Microsoft was not aware of active exploitation at the time of the bulletin release.
