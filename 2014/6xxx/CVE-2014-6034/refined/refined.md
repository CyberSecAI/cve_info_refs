Vulnerability: Remote code execution via WAR file upload
CVE-2014-6034
Affected versions: OpManager v8.8 to v11.3; Social IT Plus v11.0; IT360 v? to v10.4
Root cause of vulnerability: The application allows file uploads to arbitrary locations via directory traversal in the `regionID` parameter of the `/servlet/com.me.opmanager.extranet.remote.communication.fw.fe.FileCollector` servlet.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Unrestricted file upload, directory traversal
Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution by deploying a malicious WAR file in the Tomcat webapps directory, which is then executed by the application server.
Attack vectors: HTTP POST request to the vulnerable servlet with a crafted `regionID` parameter specifying the target path and a `FILENAME` parameter with the desired filename
Required attacker capabilities/position: Unauthenticated access is required for OpManager and Social IT, and authenticated access for IT360.
