Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-6101:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a redirect-login mechanism used in IBM Business Process Manager (BPM) that allows users to automatically log in based on previously submitted credentials. This mechanism sends a login page to the user's browser, which is then automatically submitted back to the server without user interaction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The redirect-login mechanism is vulnerable to XSS attacks. An attacker can inject malicious code into the login page, which will then be executed within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Data theft.
    - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.
    - Other malicious activities within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when accessed by a user, injects code into the redirect-login page. The code will then be executed when the page is automatically submitted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct and distribute a malicious URL that a targeted user is likely to access. This can be achieved through:
    - Social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing).
    - Embedding the link on a compromised or malicious website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of IBM Business Process Manager (Standard, Express, Advanced) - specifically versions 7.5.x, 8.0.x and 8.5.x.
- IBM recommends applying specific interim fixes (JR51211, and JR51507 for versions 7.5 and 8.0) to address the issue.
- Users are advised to avoid clicking on links from untrusted sources to mitigate the risk.
