Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6587:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists in the MulticastSocket implementation within the Libraries component of OpenJDK. The flaw is triggered when a null network interface name is used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **NULL Pointer Dereference**: The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper validation of the network interface name, which can lead to a dereference of a NULL pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Bypass Java Sandbox Restrictions:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an untrusted Java application or applet to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. The specific impact beyond sandbox bypass is not clearly outlined, however, this bypass opens doors for potentially malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector involves an untrusted Java application or applet.
- The application or applet would need to use MulticastSocket with a NULL network interface name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute an untrusted Java application or applet.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the arguments passed to MulticastSocket, specifically the network interface name.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content indicates that the issue was fixed in OpenJDK and IcedTea. It also affected multiple products including several Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions, Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Red Hat Satellite.
-  The vulnerability was addressed in the java-1.6.0-openjdk and java-1.7.0-openjdk packages in RHSA-2015:0085 and RHSA-2015:0068 respectively.  It was also addressed in RHSA-2015:0080, RHSA-2015:0079, and RHSA-2015:0086 for Oracle Java.
- It's mentioned that this vulnerability is related to the Libraries component of OpenJDK.
