### CVE-2014-6251
The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6251.

- **Vulnerability:** Stack Overflow
- **Affected Software:** CPUMiner before 2.4.1
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs when CPUMiner submits upstream work. A malicious mining pool or an attacker-in-the-middle can respond to a `mining.subscribe` request with a large `nonce2` length. When the miner discovers a valid block, it attempts to copy the large nonce into a fixed-size character array, leading to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this by controlling the mining pool or by intercepting and manipulating stratum connections to inject a large `nonce2` length.
- **Impact:** A successful stack overflow could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining control of the affected system.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be in a position to control the mining pool the CPUMiner connects to, or be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the stratum connection between the miner and a legitimate pool.
