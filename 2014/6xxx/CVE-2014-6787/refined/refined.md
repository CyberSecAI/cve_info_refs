The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6787.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication. This occurs when the application does not verify the SSL chain to ensure the certificate is from a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation, leading to the acceptance of untrusted or invalid certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network as the Android device can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- This can allow the attacker to view or modify network traffic intended to be protected by HTTPS.
- The specific impact varies depending on the application, but can include:
  - Credential stealing
  - Arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on the same network as the affected Android device.
- Exploiting the lack of proper SSL certificate validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the victim's Android device.
- They must be able to intercept network traffic between the device and the server it is communicating with.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is widespread, affecting many Android applications.
- The CERT/CC maintains a spreadsheet tracking affected applications and their fix status.
- Dynamic testing methodology using CERT Tapioca was used to find vulnerable apps.
- The vulnerability is related to improper implementation of SSL encryption in mobile apps.
- The vulnerability is also documented in the CERT Oracle Secure Coding Standard for Java.
