- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Outlook Web App (OWA) fails to properly validate a request token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Token spoofing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could send email that appears to come from a user other than the attacker (e.g., from a trusted source).
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to convince the user to visit a specially crafted URL, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attackerâ€™s website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must convince a user to click on a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
