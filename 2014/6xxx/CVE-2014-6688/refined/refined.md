      "Improperly validating the SSL/TLS certificate chain.",
      "Failing to ensure that the certificate is provided by a trusted root certificate authority (CA)."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker on the same network as the Android device may be able to view or modify network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS. This can lead to credential stealing or arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device."
