Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-6350:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Internet Explorer's failure to properly validate permissions under specific conditions. This improper validation can allow script to execute with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to elevate privileges within Internet Explorer. This occurs due to insufficient permission checks, allowing scripts to run with higher privileges than intended.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can elevate their privileges within the context of Internet Explorer.
- This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code execution, but when combined with other vulnerabilities like remote code execution, the attacker can gain higher privileges and have more control over the system.
- An attacker could use this to escalate from a low integrity level (limited permissions) to a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attacks:** The primary attack vector involves hosting a malicious website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers may also leverage compromised websites or websites accepting user-provided content to host the malicious exploit code.
- **User interaction required:** The attacker needs to convince users to interact with the malicious content, like clicking on a link redirecting to a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to host or control a website.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim to the malicious website through social engineering techniques like phishing emails or malicious links.
- The attacker needs a separate vulnerability that allows remote code execution. This vulnerability can then be used to escalate privileges.
