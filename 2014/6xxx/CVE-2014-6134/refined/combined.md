\*The CVSS Environment Score is customer environment specific and will ultimately impact the Overall CVSS Score. Customers can evaluate the impact of this vulnerability in their environments by accessing the links in the Reference section of this Security Bulletin.

## Disclaimer

Review the [IBM security bulletin disclaimer and definitions](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6610583#disclaimer) regarding your responsibilities for assessing potential impact of security vulnerabilities to your environment.

## Internal Use Only

7.1.1 and 7.1.2 are vulnerable as well, but we have no way to fix them. Development is contacting each customer on 7.1.x extended support to understand their needs for a fix or workaround. We have a clumsy workaround involving a bogus password during install and use of the 'sc.exe' tool to set the password remotely and securely.
