Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-6816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates when communicating via HTTPS. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate provided by a server is signed by a trusted root Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper SSL Certificate Validation:** Applications do not properly check the SSL/TLS certificate chain to ensure the server is legitimate.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:**  The lack of proper validation allows attackers to intercept and potentially modify encrypted traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker can view sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can alter data sent between the app and the server.
*   **Credential Theft:** Usernames, passwords, and other credentials can be stolen.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  In some scenarios, compromised communication could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker positioned on the same network as the vulnerable Android device intercepts the network traffic.
*   **Untrusted Networks:** Exploitation is more likely when the user is connected to public or otherwise untrusted Wi-Fi networks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:**  The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim's Android device.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be capable of intercepting and manipulating network traffic, such as through ARP poisoning or other MITM techniques.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is widespread, affecting many Android applications.
*   CERT/CC used their tool "CERT Tapioca" to dynamically test and identify vulnerable apps.
*   A Google spreadsheet ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t5GXwjw82SyunALVJb2w0zi3FoLRIkfGPc7AMjRF0r4/edit?usp=sharing)) tracks the affected applications and the availability of fixes.
*   The vulnerability was also highlighted in an FTC settlement with Fandango and Credit Karma for similar issues.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   Base Score: 7.8 (AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)
*   Temporal Score: 7 (E:F/RL:W/RC:C)
*   Environmental Score: 7.5 (CDP:ND/TD:H/CR:H/IR:H/AR:ND)
