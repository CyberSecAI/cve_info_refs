Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6228:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `string_chunk_split` function within `hphp/runtime/base/zend-string.cpp` of Facebook's HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `string_chunk_split` function calculates the output string length using the formula `(chunks + 1) * endlen + srclen`. The `chunks` variable is computed as `srclen / chunklen`. If `endlen` is large and either `chunks` or `srclen` are also large an integer overflow can occur.
- Specifically, when allocating memory for the return string, `safe_address(chunks + 1, endlen, srclen)` does not properly handle large values passed as arguments leading to integer overflow when the total required memory is calculated resulting in allocation of a small buffer.
- Subsequently, when the code attempts to write into the allocated buffer, this can result in a buffer overflow and lead to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash) due to the integer overflow causing a buffer overflow during memory allocation, leading to memory corruption when writing to the smaller buffer.
- Potentially other unspecified impacts may be possible due to the memory corruption but not specified in more detail in the provided content.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing crafted arguments to the `chunk_split` function. Specifically, the `src` string, chunk length, and the end string, these values can be manipulated to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker, able to control the arguments passed to the `chunk_split` function.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in HHVM version 3.3.0.
- The commit `1f91e076a585118495b976a413c1df40f6fd3d41` addresses this vulnerability by changing the way the output string length is calculated, using `safe_address` which includes additional checks that prevent the integer overflow.
- The fix also includes a test case (`chunk_split_overflow.php`) to reproduce the integer overflow.
