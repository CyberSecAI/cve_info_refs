Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the provided documents, focusing on CVE-2014-6051 and its related issues:

**CVE-2014-6051: Integer Overflow in `MallocFrameBuffer()`**

*   **Root Cause:** An integer overflow occurs when calculating the size of the framebuffer in the `MallocFrameBuffer()` function within `vncviewer.c`. This is triggered by a remote VNC server advertising a large screen size (width and height). Since width and height are 16-bit integers, multiplying them together can overflow, resulting in a small value being used for the malloc size.

*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. The size calculation for memory allocation is flawed, and the allocated memory is not sufficient to store the actual intended buffer size, which opens a path for memory corruption.

*  **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: The incorrect memory allocation can lead to a crash due to memory corruption.
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution: A carefully crafted response can potentially overwrite heap metadata and other data, which could then be leveraged for code execution on the client side.

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious VNC server sends a crafted advertisement with a large screen size to a vulnerable client.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to control a VNC server and have the victim connect as a client to that server. No authentication is required if the server allows passwordless connections.

**CVE-2014-6052: Lack of `malloc()` Return Value Checking**

*   **Root Cause:** The `HandleRFBServerMessage()` function within `libvncclient/rfbproto.c` in LibVNCServer fails to check return values from `malloc()` calls.

*   **Weakness:** Missing error handling of memory allocation. This allows an attacker to trigger a null pointer dereference or a write to an arbitrary memory location due to the missing check.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service:  If malloc() fails, the program may crash with a null pointer dereference
    *  Arbitrary Code Execution: Failure to check the result of malloc can potentially cause the client to map the framebuffer at address 0. Subsequently, writing to the framebuffer may result in arbitrary code execution.

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious VNC server provides a large screen size in messages like `FramebufferUpdate`, `ResizeFrameBuffer`, or `PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer`, forcing `malloc()` to fail on the client.

*  **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker needs control of a VNC server and have a vulnerable client connect. No authentication is needed on the server if it is configured to be passwordless.

**CVE-2014-6053: Server Crash due to large `ClientCutText` message**

*   **Root Cause:** The `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage` function within `libvncserver/rfbserver.c` fails to properly handle large `ClientCutText` messages, which are used for clipboard operations.

*   **Weakness:** A missing check before allocating the required buffer for the `ClientCutText` message. This leads to a crash when `malloc` fails or tries to allocate a very large buffer.

*  **Impact:**
     * Denial of Service:  The server crashes when it attempts to allocate a very large memory buffer without proper checks, or when `malloc` fails without proper error handling.

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious VNC client sends an oversized `ClientCutText` message to the vulnerable server.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to connect to the vulnerable VNC server as a client.  No authentication required if the VNC server is passwordless.

**CVE-2014-6054: Server Crash Due to Zero Scaling Factor**

*   **Root Cause:** The `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage` function in `libvncserver/rfbserver.c` does not handle a zero scaling factor when processing `PalmVNCSetScaleFactor` or `SetScale` messages.

*   **Weakness:** Missing check for division by zero.

*   **Impact:** Denial of Service: The server crashes due to a division by zero error.

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious VNC client sends a `PalmVNCSetScaleFactor` or `SetScale` message with a scaling factor set to zero.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a client of the VNC server. No authentication required on a passwordless server.

**CVE-2014-6055: Stack Overflows in File Transfer**

*   **Root Cause:** Two stack overflows are present in the file transfer functionality within `rfbserver.c`

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *  The `strcpy()` function is used to copy file and directory names without size checks into a stack-based buffer of fixed size (MAX_PATH).
    * Client provided `FileTime` attribute is copied into a stack-based buffer of size 64 during message processing with missing length check.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service:  The overflows can crash the VNC server.
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution: The overflows can overwrite stack variables and return addresses potentially leading to code execution.

*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious VNC client sends a file transfer offer message with long file/directory names or large `FileTime` attributes.

*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires a malicious VNC client to connect to the vulnerable VNC server. Requires authentication unless VNC server is passwordless.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities and Common Themes:**

*   **Memory Management Issues:** The core issue across several vulnerabilities is related to improper memory management within LibVNCServer, specifically due to integer overflows, missing malloc error handling, and missing size checks before memory allocations.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Multiple vulnerabilities result in DoS conditions through crashes, excessive resource consumption, and null pointer dereferences.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In a number of these cases, vulnerabilities can potentially be used for remote code execution, primarily on the client side but also on the server, through exploiting heap-based or stack-based buffer overflows.
*  **VNC Protocol Manipulation:** All the issues are exploitable by manipulation of the VNC protocol itself, like advertising large screen sizes or sending messages with zero scaling factors.
*   **Authentication Bypass (Potentially):** While these vulnerabilities are considered post-authentication, they also affect systems in a passwordless setup, such as when displaying login screens.

**Remediation and Mitigation:**

The documents describe various fixes for different products:
* Updating the `libvncserver` packages (or `kdenetwork`, `italc`, which embed it), to the listed fixed versions that patch the mentioned flaws.
* The advisories all point to the need to restart affected applications after updating libraries.
* Patches to `krfb` were also introduced by the kde project to address the vulnerabilities, and also to unbundle the embedded version of the vulnerable library and use a system-wide installed version.

In summary, all the listed vulnerabilities involve incorrect handling of memory operations or messages within the VNC protocol, and can lead to DoS or arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation relies on manipulating server or client actions. The fixes are all about patching `libvncserver` to correctly handle allocations, buffer sizes, and input values.
