# CVE-2014-6053

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2014-6052.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2014-6054.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2014-6053 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-6053)

#### Description

The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer 0.9.9 and earlier does not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted message that is processed by using a single unchecked malloc.

# TigerVNC: Integer overflow — GLSA **201612-36**

An integer overflow in TigerVNC might allow remote attackers to
execute
arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/tigervnc** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.2** |

### Background

TigerVNC is a high-performance VNC server/client.

### Description

TigerVNC is impacted by the same vulnerability as found in
CVE-2014-6051. An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer
overflow, was found in the way screen sizes were handled.

### Impact

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the client, or
cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All TigerVNC users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/tigervnc-1.4.2"

```

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-19 07:42:33 UTC  ``` Two stack-based buffer overflow flaws were reported in LibVNCServer's file transfer handling. A VNC client could use these flaws to cause the VNC server to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.  Upstream commits:  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/06ccdf016154fde8eccb5355613ba04c59127b2e>  <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/f528072216dec01cee7ca35d94e171a3b909e677>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c2)  Petr Pisar    2014-09-19 08:20:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to Murray McAllister from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c0)) > Upstream commits: >  > <https://github.com/newsoft/libvncserver/commit/> > 06ccdf016154fde8eccb5355613ba04c59127b2e >   The change contains:  -rfbBool rfbFilenameTranslate2UNIX(rfbClientPtr cl, char *path, char *unixPath) +rfbBool rfbFilenameTranslate2UNIX(rfbClientPtr cl, /* in */ char *path, /* out */ char *unixPath, size_t unixPathMaxLen )  I.e. it adds a new argument. The rfbFilenameTranslate2UNIX() function is not declared in header files, but it's still exported by the libraries:  $ nm -D /usr/lib64/libvnc{client,server}.so | grep rfbFilenameTranslate2UNIX 000000000000d4a0 T rfbFilenameTranslate2UNIX  So it breaks ABI.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c3)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-24 04:20:26 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT acknowledges Nicolas RUFF as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c4)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-24 04:21:33 UTC  ``` Public now:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/639>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c5)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-24 04:31:53 UTC  ```  Created libvncserver tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1145878](show_bug.cgi?id=1145878 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-6051 CVE-2014-6053 CVE-2014-6052 CVE-2014-6055 CVE-2014-6054 libvncserver: various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1145879](show_bug.cgi?id=1145879 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-6051 CVE-2014-6053 CVE-2014-6052 CVE-2014-6055 CVE-2014-6054 libvncserver: various flaws [epel-5]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1145880](show_bug.cgi?id=1145880 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2014-6051 CVE-2014-6053 CVE-2014-6052 CVE-2014-6055 libvncserver: various flaws [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-24 04:49:32 UTC  ```  Created krfb tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1145883](show_bug.cgi?id=1145883 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-6051 CVE-2014-6053 CVE-2014-6052 CVE-2014-6055 CVE-2014-6054 krfb: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c7)  Murray McAllister    2014-09-24 04:51:23 UTC  ``` krfb advisory:  <http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20140923-1.txt>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c8)  Than Ngo    2014-09-24 10:06:18 UTC  ``` it's only effected in f19 because it uses the embeded libvncserver. i have built new krfb with "the unbundle libvncserver fix" which now uses the system libvncserver in f19.  <http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=580492>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1144293#c10)  Fedora Update System    2014-09-29 04:06:41 UTC  ``` libvncserver-0.9.10-0.6.20140718git9453be42.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

**oCERT-2014-007 libvncserver multiple issues**

**Description**:

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical sharing system based on
the Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol.

The [LibVNCServer](http://libvnc.github.io)
project, an open source library for implementing VNC compliant communication,
suffers from a number of bugs that can be potentially exploited with security
impact.

Various implementation issues resulting in remote code execution and/or DoS
conditions on both the VNC server and client side have been discovered.

1. A malicious VNC server can trigger incorrect memory management
   handling by advertising a large screen size parameter to the VNC
   client. This would result in multiple memory corruptions and could
   allow remote code execution on the VNC client.
2. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple DoS conditions on the VNC
   server by advertising a large screen size, ClientCutText message length
   and/or a zero scaling factor parameter.
3. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple stack-based buffer
   overflows by passing a long file and directory names and/or attributes
   (FileTime) when using the file transfer message feature.

It should be noted that every described issue represents a
post-authentication bug, therefore the server side conditions can be
anonymously leveraged only if the VNC server is configured to allow
unauthenticated sessions.

**Affected version**:

[LibVNCServer](http://libvnc.github.io) <= 0.9.9

**Fixed version**:

[LibVNCServer](http://libvnc.github.io), N/A

# Multiple issues in libVNCserver

---

*From*: Nicolas RUFF <nicolas.ruff () gmail com>

*Date*: Tue, 23 Sep 2014 23:47:05 +0200

---

```
Hello list,

I am currently reviewing libVNCserver for potential security issues.

Project home is: <https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver>

Here are my findings so far. Found bugs are either client- or server-side
(libVNCserver provides both). All bugs require authentication. However they
still pose a significant issue in the following scenarios:
* VNC server is running in password-less mode because authentication is
required afterwards (e.g. X11 login screen).
* Attacker is located in a man-in-the-middle position.
* Attacker has legitimate access to the VNC server but possibly not to the
host server (e.g. virtual machine, remote assistance to a customer).

Fixes are being committed - a few of them are still pending in the pull
request.

CVE-2014-6051 Integer overflow in MallocFrameBuffer() on client side.

A malicious VNC server could advertise a very large screen size (by RFB
protocol, width and height are 16-bit integers), resulting in an integer
overflow during malloc() on client-side. Heap corruption, and possibly
remote code execution on client-side could ensue.

CVE-2014-6052 Lack of malloc() return value checking on client side.

malloc() return value was not checked on client-side during framebuffer
setup. A malicious VNC server that advertises a large enough screen size to
make malloc() fail could basically map the framebuffer at address 0, and
write anything-anywhere in client process memory using selective
FramebufferUpdate messages. This could certainly turn into remote code
execution on client-side.

CVE-2014-6053 Server crash on a very large ClientCutText message.

A malicious client could advertise a very large ClientCutText message size
(by RFB protocol, size is encoded on a 32-bit integer). malloc() is likely
to fail in that case; as malloc() return value is not checked, this will
most likely result in a server crash.

Note: this issue also affects RealVNC as per CVE-2010-5304.
<http://www.iss.net/security_center/reference/vuln/VNC_Client_Cut_Text_DoS.htm>
<http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/89160/RealVNC-VNC-Server-Free-Edition-4.1.3-Denial-Of-Service.html>

CVE-2014-6054 Server crash when scaling factor is set to zero.

A malicious client could set the scaling factor to 0, which will result in
a server crash (division by zero).

CVE-2014-6055 Multiple stack overflows in File Transfer feature.

1/ The non-standard file transfer messages (UltraVNC feature) will blindly
strcpy() client-provided file and directory names into a stack-based buffer
of size MAX_PATH, resulting in multiple stack-based buffer overflows on
server-side.

2/ Client-supplied FileTime attribute is copied into a stack-based
buffer of size 64 during rfbFileTransferOffer message parsing, resulting in
a stack-based buffer overflow on server-side.

Regards,
- Nicolas RUFF

## Synopsis

Moderate: libvncserver security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2015%3A0113)

## Topic

Updated libvncserver packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 Extended Update Support.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

LibVNCServer is a library that allows for easy creation of VNC server or
client functionality.

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way screen sizes were handled by LibVNCServer. A malicious VNC
server could use this flaw to cause a client to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code in the client. (CVE-2014-6051)

Two stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way LibVNCServer
handled file transfers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the
VNC server using a malicious VNC client. (CVE-2014-6055)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting these issues. oCERT
acknowledges Nicolas Ruff as the original reporter.

All libvncserver users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against libvncserver must be restarted for this update
to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

KDE Project Security Advisory
=============================
Title: krfb: multiple security issues in libvncserver.
Risk Rating: Medium
CVE: CVE-2014-6055 and others
Platforms: All
Versions: krfb < 4.14.2
Author: Martin Sandsmark
Date: 23 September 2014
Overview
========
krfb 4.14 embeds libvncserver which has had several security issues.
For future versions krfb instead depends on a system-installed
libvncserver, but for 4.14 the bundled version needs to be updated.
Impact
======
Several remotely exploitable security issues have been uncovered in
libvncserver, some of which might allow a remote authenticated user
code execution or application crashes.
Workaround
==========
None.
Solution
========
Upgrade krfb to 4.14.2 once released, unbundle libvncserver or apply the following patches:
http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=krfb.git&a=commit&h=d931eafccf3140d740ac61e876dce72a23ade7f4

Subject: [oCERT-2014-007] libvncserver multiple issues

#2014-007 libvncserver multiple issues

Description:

Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical sharing system based on the
Remote Frame Buffer (RFB) protocol.

The LibVNCServer project, an open source library for implementing VNC
compliant communication, suffers from a number of bugs that can be potentially
exploited with security impact.

Various implementation issues resulting in remote code execution and/or DoS
conditions on both the VNC server and client side have been discovered.

 1. A malicious VNC server can trigger incorrect memory management
    handling by advertising a large screen size parameter to the VNC
    client. This would result in multiple memory corruptions and could
    allow remote code execution on the VNC client.

 2. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple DoS conditions on the VNC
    server by advertising a large screen size, ClientCutText message
    length and/or a zero scaling factor parameter.

 3. A malicious VNC client can trigger multiple stack-based buffer
    overflows by passing a long file and directory names and/or attributes
    (FileTime) when using the file transfer message feature.

It should be noted that every described issue represents a post-authentication
bug, therefore the server side conditions can be anonymously leveraged only if
the VNC server is configured to allow unauthenticated sessions.

Affected version:

LibVNCServer <= 0.9.9

Fixed version:

LibVNCServer, N/A

Debian Bug     : 762745

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libvncserver, a library to
implement VNC server functionality. These vulnerabilities might result in the
execution of arbitrary code or denial of service in both the client and the
server side.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.9+dfsg-1+deb7u1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.9+dfsg-6.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libvncserver packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

                 CVE-2019-15681

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of iTALC, a
classroom management software. All vulnerabilities referenced below are
issues that have originally been reported against Debian source package
libvncserver. The italc source package in Debian ships a custom-patched
version of libvncserver, thus libvncserver's security fixes required
porting over.

CVE-2014-6051

    Integer overflow in the MallocFrameBuffer function in vncviewer.c in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) and possibly executed arbitrary code via an advertisement for
    a large screen size, which triggered a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2014-6052

    The HandleRFBServerMessage function in libvncclient/rfbproto.c in
    LibVNCServer did not check certain malloc return values, which
    allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by specifying a large
    screen size in a (1) FramebufferUpdate, (2) ResizeFrameBuffer, or (3)
    PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer message.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
    attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
    daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
    single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2014-6054

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and server crash) via
    a zero value in the scaling factor in a (1) PalmVNCSetScaleFactor or
    (2) SetScale message.

CVE-2014-6055

    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the File Transfer feature in
    rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote authenticated users to
    cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
    via a (1) long file or (2) directory name or the (3) FileTime
    attribute in a rfbFileTransferOffer message.

CVE-2016-9941

    Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the
    client drawing area.

CVE-2016-9942

    Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer
    allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO
    payload decompressed length exceeded what is specified by the tile
    dimensions.

CVE-2018-6307

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-7225

    An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer.
    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2018-15126

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-15127

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability in server code
    of file transfer extension that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20749

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20750

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20019

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bound write vulnerabilities in
    VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20748

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in
    libvncclient/rfbproto.c. The fix for CVE-2018-20019 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20020

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability inside
    structure in VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20021

    LibVNC contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop vulnerability in VNC client
    code. Vulnerability allows attacker to consume excessive amount of
    resources like CPU and RAM

CVE-2018-20022

    LibVNC contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper Initialization
    vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed attackers to read stack
    memory and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with
    another vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout
    and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20023

    LibVNC contained CWE-665: Improper Initialization vulnerability in
    VNC Repeater client code that allowed attacker to read stack memory
    and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another
    vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout and in
    bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20024

    LibVNC contained null pointer dereference in VNC client code that
    could result DoS.

CVE-2019-15681

    LibVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could be abused for
    information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could
    be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appeared to
    be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.0.2+dfsg1-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your italc packages.
