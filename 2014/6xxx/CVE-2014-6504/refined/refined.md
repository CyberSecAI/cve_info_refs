Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6504:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `lists.opensuse.org`, `www.redhat.com`, `www.oracle.com`, `bugzilla.redhat.com`, `www.debian.org`, `www.ubuntu.com`, `secunia.com`, `linux.oracle.com` and `marc.info` clearly indicates that this vulnerability is related to OpenJDK, specifically a flaw in the Hotspot component.  The identified CVE-2014-6504 is consistently mentioned in the context of updates for OpenJDK across multiple platforms and distributions, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is an "incorrect optimization of range checks in C2 compiler" within the Hotspot component of OpenJDK. This flaw can lead to the generation of incorrect bytecode, according to the Red Hat Bugzilla entry. This suggests a compiler optimization error.
*   This issue could lead to a "specially crafted class file" being able to "trigger JVM memory corruption"

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect C2 compiler optimization:** The core weakness lies in the C2 compiler improperly optimizing range checks.
*   **Lack of proper bounds check:** The Hotspot JVM fails to properly perform boundary checks, specifically when reading "BootstrapMethods attributes from the Java class files".

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  A specially crafted class file (or bytecode with incorrect range checks) could lead to memory corruption allowing for disclosure of sensitive data or portions of the JVM memory.
*   **Memory corruption:**  The JVM memory can be corrupted by a specially crafted class file.
*   **Denial of service:**  One source mentions it could lead to denial of service.
*   **Remote Unauthorized access:** Some sources list "Remote unauthorized access" as an impact
    
**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through crafted Java class files.
*   An attacker could craft a Java applet or application with specific bytecode designed to trigger the flawed optimization in the C2 compiler. This implies that simply loading a crafted class could trigger the vulnerability.
*   The use of HTTP is mentioned in some contexts implying a network component.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to create or modify Java class files.
*   The attacker needs to get the vulnerable code to be executed by a user, either by visiting a malicious website, via a network connection, or by planting an affected jar file and then having it triggered via a sandboxed application or applet
*   The vulnerability can be triggered remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided information gives more details about the specific location of the vulnerability than the standard CVE description. This includes reference to the C2 compiler and byte code generation. The content also clarifies that not only information disclosure is at risk but also integrity and availability could be impacted.
