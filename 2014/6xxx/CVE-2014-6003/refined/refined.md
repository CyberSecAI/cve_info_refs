  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates during HTTPS communication.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper verification of server certificates in SSL/TLS connections (CWE-295, CWE-296)."

      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device. No specific expertise is mentioned, but it is implied that the attacker needs to be able to conduct a MITM attack."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content includes a link to a spreadsheet that contains more specific information on vulnerable applications, which indicates that a large number of apps are affected. The vulnerability note also mentions tools like CERT Tapioca used to discover these vulnerabilities.
