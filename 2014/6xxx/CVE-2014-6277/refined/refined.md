{
  "CVE-2014-6277": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "GNU Bash does not properly parse function definitions in the values of environment variables.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper parsing of function definitions in environment variables.",
      "Uninitialized memory access leading to reads from, and then subsequent writes to, a pointer that is fully within attacker's control."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd",
      "mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server",
      "Scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients",
      "Other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to set environment variables and trigger Bash execution across a privilege boundary."
  }
