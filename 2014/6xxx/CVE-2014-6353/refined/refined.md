Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6353:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: The core issue is that Internet Explorer's memory management allows for the corruption of memory in such a way that it enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: If successfully exploited, this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the system. This includes installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised Websites: Attackers can also leverage compromised or user-content-hosting sites. These could contain malicious content to trigger the vulnerability.
- Social Engineering: In all cases, the user needs to be convinced to visit the malicious site (e.g. by clicking a link in an email).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host a malicious website or compromise a site to host the malicious content.
- Ability to convince a user to visit the malicious site via social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, and 11, across both client and server versions of Windows but with a lower severity rating (Moderate) for server environments.
- The vulnerability was addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The update was re-released due to issues with the initial patch.
- The document also mentions mitigations, such as Enhanced Security Configuration (for server environments) and EMET, which can help reduce the attack surface but does not fix the underlying vulnerability.
