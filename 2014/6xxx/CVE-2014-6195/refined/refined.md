Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-6195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that the Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) Client's Java GUI or Web GUI interfaces for the Data Protection for Domino plugin can still be used even after an authentication failure. This means that even if a user fails to provide correct credentials, they can still interact with the GUI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Authentication:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly restrict access to the GUI after failed authentication, potentially due to flawed session handling or authorization logic.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The software does not enforce proper access controls following an authentication failure, allowing potentially unauthorized operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Restoration:** An attacker could potentially restore Domino database or transaction log backups without proper authorization. This can lead to data breaches, manipulation, or corruption, depending on the nature of the restored data.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Issues:** Unauthorized access and data restoration can compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information, alter the integrity of data, and potentially disrupt the availability of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network by attempting to access the Java or Web GUI after a failed authentication attempt.
- **Local Access:** Attackers could also exploit this vulnerability if they have local access to the machine running the TSM client software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need the ability to send requests to the TSM client's Java GUI or Web GUI interface.
- **Knowledge of the System:** An attacker needs to be aware of the existence of the TSM client and the Data Protection for Domino plugin. They need a basic knowledge of its interfaces and configurations
- **Failed Authentication:** Attackers must trigger a failed authentication attempt to gain access to the GUI.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Tivoli Storage Manager for Mail: Data Protection for Domino versions 5.4, 5.5, 6.3, and 7.1.
- The associated defect is located in the TSM Backup-Archive Client software.
- Fixes are provided in updated versions of the TSM Backup-Archive Client.
- Workarounds suggest restricting access to the TSM Java GUI and Web GUI to only trusted users.
