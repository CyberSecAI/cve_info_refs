{
  "CVE-2014-6410": {
    "Description": "A stack overflow flaw caused by infinite recursion was found in the way the Linux kernel's Universal Disk Format (UDF) file system implementation processed indirect Information Control Blocks (ICBs). An attacker with physical access to the system could use a specially crafted UDF image to crash the system.",
    "Root cause": "Infinite recursion while processing indirect ICBs in the UDF filesystem implementation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper bounds checking or recursion limits when processing indirect ICBs in the UDF filesystem"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (system crash) due to stack overflow.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Mounting a specially crafted UDF image (CD-ROM, DVD, image file)"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Physical access to the system.",
       "Ability to mount a malicious UDF image."
    ],
