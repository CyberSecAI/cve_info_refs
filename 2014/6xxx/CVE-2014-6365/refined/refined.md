Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-6365:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Internet Explorer's XSS filter handles HTML attributes. Specifically, the filter incorrectly disables certain HTML attributes in filtered HTTP response data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Filter Bypass:** The core issue is that the XSS filter, designed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks, can be bypassed. This allows initially disabled scripts to run within an unintended security context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is information disclosure.
- **Script Execution in Wrong Context:** An attacker can cause malicious script code to run on another user's system in the context of a third-party website. This script can then perform actions that the third-party website is allowed to perform on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Content:** An attacker would need to inject specially crafted content onto a website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker has to convince the user to view this content on the affected website. This can be achieved by:
  - Trick users into clicking on a malicious link.
  - Compromising a website to include the malicious content.
  - Utilizing a website that accepts user provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website access:** The attacker requires a vector to get the malicious code into a website viewable by the victim.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to socially engineer the user to visit the compromised website or click a link with the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" on Windows clients and "Low" on Windows servers.
- The fix involves modifying the XSS filter to prevent it from incorrectly disabling HTML attributes.
- The vulnerability is addressed in the security update 3008923 detailed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-080.
