# TYPO3-EXT-SA-2014-006: Captcha Bypass in extension "powermail" (powermail)

It has been discovered that the extension "powermail" (powermail) is susceptible to Captcha Bypass

**Release Date:** April 10, 2014

**Bulletin update:** September 18, 2014 (added CVE)

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** powermail: Version 2.0.0 - 2.0.10

**Vulnerability Type:** Captcha Bypass

**Severity:** Low

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:O/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=%28AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:F/RL:O/RC:C%29&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**CVE:** CVE-2014-6288

**Problem Description:** The extension powermail offers the use of a captch validation to secure forms. It was possible to bypass the captcha validation and submit forms.

**Important Note:** Other field validators weren't involved so any other validation worked as expected.

**Solution:** Updated version 2.0.11 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at [http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/powermail/2.0.11/t3x/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/download/powermail/2.0.11/t3x/ "Opens external link in new window"). Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible as long as they use captchas in their forms.

**Credits:** Credits go to Jigal van Hemert who discovered and reported this issue.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Guide](http://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/SecurityGuide/ "Initiates file download"). Please subscribe to the [typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce "Opens external link in new window") to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.
