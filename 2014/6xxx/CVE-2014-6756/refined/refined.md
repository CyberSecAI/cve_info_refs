The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6756.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means that the applications do not verify if the certificate was issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation.
- Failure to verify the SSL chain against trusted root CAs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- Viewing or modifying network traffic that should have been protected by HTTPS.
- Possible credential stealing.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker on the same network as the Android device.
- Exploiting the lack of proper SSL certificate validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the Android device and the server.
- Presence on the same network (e.g. public Wi-Fi).
