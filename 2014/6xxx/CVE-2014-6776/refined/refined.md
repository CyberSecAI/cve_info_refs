The provided content relates to CVE-2014-6776.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple Android applications fail to properly validate SSL certificates provided by HTTPS connections. This means the applications do not verify if the certificate is issued by a trusted root certificate authority.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper SSL certificate validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker on the same network can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
- Possible outcomes include:
    - Viewing or modifying network traffic that should be protected by HTTPS.
    - Credential stealing.
    - Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the same network as the Android device.
- Untrusted networks, including public Wi-Fi, increase the risk.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable Android device.
- The attacker needs to be capable of intercepting network traffic.
