Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2014-6070:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   The LogAnalyzer application did not properly sanitize the hostname field from syslog messages before displaying it in the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The application stores the malicious payload (injected via syslog hostname) in its database. When a user views the log entries, the stored XSS is triggered, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize input received from syslog messages before including it in its output. Specifically the hostname field was not escaped when rendered in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim user's browser. This code can be used to:
    *   Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user, such as modifying configurations or deleting logs.
    *   Display misleading or harmful content to the user.
*   **Persistent Nature:** The XSS payload is stored, meaning the attack will be triggered every time a user accesses the infected log data unless the malicious entry is removed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Syslog Message Injection:** An attacker can inject the XSS payload by manipulating the hostname field of a syslog message sent to the vulnerable LogAnalyzer server.
*   **Manipulation of Logged Hostnames:** An attacker can send syslog messages from a system with a specially crafted hostname designed to contain malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Syslog Messages:** The attacker needs to be able to send syslog messages to the LogAnalyzer server or control a device that does.
*   **Knowledge of Syslog Format:** The attacker needs to know how to inject the malicious payload within the hostname field of the syslog message.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the LogAnalyzer server to send the malicious syslog message.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in LogAnalyzer versions 3.6.5 and earlier.
*   A fix was released in version 3.6.6.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Dolev Farhi.
*   The exploit requires sending a syslog message where the hostname field contains the malicious javascript. The script is then executed when a user views the logs in the LogAnalyzer web interface.
