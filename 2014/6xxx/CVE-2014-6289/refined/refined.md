Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-6289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `pt_extbase` extension included an Ajax dispatcher that allowed direct access to any action within any Extbase extension installed on the system.
*   This dispatcher failed to perform access checks, allowing unauthorized access to backend modules.
*   The `yag` extension also contained a vulnerable (though unused) Ajax dispatcher.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access Bypass:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of access control in the Ajax dispatcher, enabling users to bypass intended security measures.
*   **Insecure Dispatcher:** The dispatcher's design allowed for arbitrary execution of actions in any Extbase controller without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive backend functionalities, such as user administration modules.
*   **Data Manipulation/Disclosure:** Depending on the targeted controller, an attacker could manipulate data or disclose sensitive information.
*   **System Compromise:** In the worst case, this could lead to full system compromise depending on the actions the attacker could trigger in the backend.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, requiring no physical access to the server.
*   **Direct Request to Dispatcher:** An attacker could craft a specific request to the vulnerable dispatcher, targeting specific actions within Extbase extensions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send requests to the affected TYPO3 instance.
*   **Knowledge of System:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the TYPO3 installation, specifically the Extbase extensions in use and the actions available within their controllers.

**Additional Notes**

* The `yag` extension's unused dispatcher was removed and `pt_extbase`'s dispatcher was modified to include access checks.
*  Third party extensions using the `pt_extbase` dispatcher need to be added to the list of allowed actions after the fix.
*   The advisory suggests updating both extensions to versions 3.0.1 (for `yag`) and 1.5.1 (for `pt_extbase`) or higher.
