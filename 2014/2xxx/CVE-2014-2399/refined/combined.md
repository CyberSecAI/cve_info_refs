Advisory: Endeca Latitude Cross-Site Request Forgery

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability in Endeca Latitude. Using this vulnerability, an attacker
might be able to change several different settings of the Endeca
Latitude instance or disable it entirely.

Details
=======

Product: Endeca Latitude
Affected Versions: 2.2.2, potentially others
Fixed Versions: N/A
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Request Forgery
Security Risk: low
Vendor URL: N/A
Vendor Status: decided not to fix
Advisory URL: https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2013-002
Advisory Status: published
CVE:  CVE-2014-2399
CVE URL: https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2399

Introduction
============

Endeca Latitude is an enterprise data discovery platform for advanced,
yet intuitive, exploration and analysis of complex and varied data.
Information is loaded from disparate source systems and stored in a
faceted data model that dynamically supports changing data. This
integrated and enriched data is made available for search, discovery,
and analysis via interactive and configurable applications.

(from the vendor's homepage)

More Details
============

Endeca Latitude offers administrators the ability to perform different
administrative and configuration operations by accessing URLs.
These URLs are not secured by a randomly generated token and therefore
are prone to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

For example by accessing the URL http://example.com/admin?op=exit an
administrator can shut down the Endeca Latitude instance. Several other
URLs exist (as documented at [1] and [2]) which can be used to trigger
operations such as flushing cashes or changing the logging settings.

Proof of Concept
================

An attacker might prepare a website, which can trigger arbitrary
functionality (see [1] and [2]) of an Endeca Latitude instance if
someone opens the attacker's website in a browser that can reach Endeca
Latitude.  An easy way to implement this is to embed a hidden image into
an arbitrary website which uses the corresponding URL as its source:

<img src="http://example.com/admin?op=exit" style="display:hidden" />
<img src="http://example.com/config?op=log-disable" style="display:hidden" />
[...]

Workaround
==========

The vendor did not update the vulnerable software, but recommends to
configure all installations to require mutual authentication using TLS
certificates for both servers and clients, while discouraging users from
installing said client certificates in browsers.

Fix
===

Not available. The vendor did not update the vulnerable software to
remedy this issue.

Security Risk
=============

The vulnerability can enable attackers to be able to interact with an
Endeca Latitude instance in different ways. Possible attacks include the
changing of settings as well as denying service by shutting down a
running instance. Attackers mainly benefit from this vulnerability if
the instance is not already available to them, but for example only to
restricted IP addresses or after authentication. Since this makes it
harder to identify potential target systems and the attack mainly allows
to disturb the service until it is re-started, the risk of this
vulnerability is considered to be low.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2014

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 104 new security fixes across the product families listed below.

Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at: [http://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2014 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1618213.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1618213.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 37 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 35 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2014verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

Advisory: Endeca Latitude Cross-Site Request Forgery

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability in Endeca Latitude. Using this vulnerability, an attacker
might be able to change several different settings of the Endeca
Latitude instance or disable it entirely.

Details
=======

Product: Endeca Latitude
Affected Versions: 2.2.2, potentially others
Fixed Versions: N/A
Vulnerability Type: Cross-Site Request Forgery
Security Risk: low
Vendor URL: N/A
Vendor Status: decided not to fix
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2013-002>
Advisory Status: published
CVE:  CVE-2014-2399
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2399>

Introduction
============

Endeca Latitude is an enterprise data discovery platform for advanced,
yet intuitive, exploration and analysis of complex and varied data.
Information is loaded from disparate source systems and stored in a
faceted data model that dynamically supports changing data. This
integrated and enriched data is made available for search, discovery,
and analysis via interactive and configurable applications.

(from the vendor's homepage)

More Details
============

Endeca Latitude offers administrators the ability to perform different
administrative and configuration operations by accessing URLs.
These URLs are not secured by a randomly generated token and therefore
are prone to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

For example by accessing the URL <http://example.com/admin?op=exit> an
administrator can shut down the Endeca Latitude instance. Several other
URLs exist (as documented at [1] and [2]) which can be used to trigger
operations such as flushing cashes or changing the logging settings.

Proof of Concept
================

An attacker might prepare a website, which can trigger arbitrary
functionality (see [1] and [2]) of an Endeca Latitude instance if
someone opens the attacker's website in a browser that can reach Endeca
Latitude.  An easy way to implement this is to embed a hidden image into
an arbitrary website which uses the corresponding URL as its source:

<img src="<http://example.com/admin?op=exit">; style="display:hidden" />
<img src="<http://example.com/config?op=log-disable">; style="display:hidden" />
[...]

Workaround
==========

The vendor did not update the vulnerable software, but recommends to
configure all installations to require mutual authentication using TLS
certificates for both servers and clients, while discouraging users from
installing said client certificates in browsers.

Fix
===

Not available. The vendor did not update the vulnerable software to
remedy this issue.

Security Risk
=============

The vulnerability can enable attackers to be able to interact with an
Endeca Latitude instance in different ways. Possible attacks include the
changing of settings as well as denying service by shutting down a
running instance. Attackers mainly benefit from this vulnerability if
the instance is not already available to them, but for example only to
restricted IP addresses or after authentication. Since this makes it
harder to identify potential target systems and the attack mainly allows
to disturb the service until it is re-started, the risk of this
vulnerability is considered to be low.

Timeline
========

2013-10-06 Vulnerability identified
2013-10-08 Customer approved disclosure to vendor
2013-10-15 Vendor notified
2013-10-17 Vendor responded that investigation/fixing is in progress
2014-02-24 Vendor responded that bug is fixed and scheduled for a future
           CPU
2014-03-13 Vendor responded with additional information about a
           potential workaround
2014-04-15 Vendor releases Critical Patch Update Advisory with little
           information on the proposed fix
2014-04-16 More information requested from vendor
2014-05-02 Vendor responds with updated information
2014-06-25 Advisory released
