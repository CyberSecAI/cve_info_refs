## Updated directfb packages fix security vulnerabilities

Publication date: 03 May 2015

Modification date: 03 May 2015

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-2977](CVE-2014-2977.html)
,
[CVE-2014-2978](CVE-2014-2978.html)

## Description

```
Updated directfb packages fix security vulnerabilities:

Multiple integer signedness errors in the Dispatch_Write function in
proxy/dispatcher/idirectfbsurface_dispatcher.c in DirectFB allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via the Voodoo interface, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow
(CVE-2014-2977).

The Dispatch_Write function in proxy/dispatcher/idirectfbsurface_dispatcher.c
in DirectFB allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via the Voodoo interface, which triggers an
out-of-bounds write (CVE-2014-2978).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
DirectFB was updated to fix two security issues.
The following vulnerabilities were fixed:
\* CVE-2014-2977: Multiple integer signedness errors could allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via the Voodoo interface, which triggers a stack-based
buffer overflow.
\* CVE-2014-2978: Remote attackers could cause a denial of service (crash)
and possibly execute arbitrary code via the Voodoo interface, which
triggers an out-of-bounds write.
Patch Instructions:

An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
DirectFB was updated to fix two security issues.
The following vulnerabilities were fixed:
\* CVE-2014-2977: Multiple integer signedness errors could allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via the Voodoo interface, which triggers a stack-based
buffer overflow.

and possibly execute arbitrary code via the Voodoo interface, which
triggers an out-of-bounds write.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.2:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2015-340=1
