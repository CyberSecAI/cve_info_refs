    "description": "Multiple integer signedness errors in the Dispatch_Write function in proxy/dispatcher/idirectfbsurface_dispatcher.c in DirectFB allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via the Voodoo interface, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.",
