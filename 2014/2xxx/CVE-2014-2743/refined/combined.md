Hash: SHA1

> <http://xmpp.org/resources/security-notices/uncontrolled-resource-consumption-with-highly-compressed-xmpp-stanzas/>

igniterealtime.org   Openfire   Fixed in 3.9.2

We did not find any commits for this under the
<http://fisheye.igniterealtime.org/changelog/> URL. Accordingly, only
one CVE is possible at present. Use CVE-2014-2741.

Isode Ltd.           M-Link     Fixed in 16.0v7

We did not find any details about the change under the
<http://www.isode.com/products/m-link.html> URL. (Also, the
<http://www.isode.com/evaluate/instant-messaging-xmpp.html> page seems
to imply that this is not open source.) Accordingly, only one CVE is
possible at present. Use CVE-2014-2742.

lightwitch.org       Metronome  Fix in progress
<http://code.lightwitch.org/metronome/rev/49f47277a411>

Use CVE-2014-2743 for "Don't process deflated data if it exceedes the
max allowed limit."

Use CVE-2014-2744 for "Don't allow to compress a stream if it's not
authenticated."

Prosody              Prosody    Fixed in 0.9.4
<http://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0-9-4-released/>

Use CVE-2014-2745 for these changes that address resource consumption
in general:
  <http://hg.prosody.im/0.9/rev/a97591d2e1ad>
  <http://hg.prosody.im/0.9/rev/1107d66d2ab2>

Use CVE-2014-2744 for this change that addresses decompression of
unauthenticated data:
  <http://hg.prosody.im/0.9/rev/b3b1c9da38fb>

(This is exactly the same plugins/mod_compression.lua fix as in
Metronome, and thus has the same CVE ID. Metronome was originally
based on the Prosody codebase.)

Tigase               Tigase     Fixed in 5.2.1
<http://www.tigase.org/content/uncontrolled-resource-consumption-highly-compressed-xmpp-messages>
<https://projects.tigase.org/projects/tigase-server/repository/revisions/7f5af2f8c5b97bbf9def66fbb9dd47746a7ac292>
<https://projects.tigase.org/issues/1780> (not a public bug)

We did not determine that more than one issue was fixed. Accordingly,
only one CVE is possible at present. Use CVE-2014-2746.

Erlang Solutions     MongooseIM Under Investigation

We did not find anything under the
<https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/commits/master> URL. There is
apparently no publicly known vulnerability and thus no CVE assignment.

Subject: Re: Possible CVE Request: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption with XMPP-Layer Compression

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> Is this something which should get one CVE, or is a CVE for each
> implementation needed?

A single CVE for this cross-vendor situation seems wrong because the
specification apparently does not require implementations to have an
unrestricted decompression capability.

There could conceivably be two CVEs for a single implementation,
although we haven't yet found a reference that is reporting an
implementation's problems at that level of detail. Most likely there
would be one CVE per implementation.

> <http://xmpp.org/resources/security-notices/uncontrolled-resource-consumption-with-highly-compressed-xmpp-stanzas/>

The two types of CVEs would be:

(1)
> XEP-0170 on "Recommended Order of Stream Feature Negotiation" suggests
> to negotiate stream compression after the authentication of the
> principals. This suggests that xmppbombs can be used only after the
> user authentication. When decompressing XMPP stanzas, an XMPP server
> must limit the resources allocated to this task. If the server fails
> to do that, it can monopolize the CPU usage and allocate all the
> available memory.

Here, the root cause is that the behavior in the authenticated case
does not properly address resource consumption. Apparently multiple
vendors are characterizing this as a vulnerability.

(2)
> it has been reported that some implementations allow the use of
> compression before the authentication phase therefore opening up this
> vulnerability to unknown attackers.

Here, the root cause is a violation of a specification, resulting in a
security impact.

A hypothetical example is that a server is willing to decompress
relatively short strings in unauthenticated sessions (e.g., decompress
32 kilobytes to 32 megabytes). That same server has no restrictions on
authenticated sessions, and can produce gigabytes of uncompressed
data. In this scenario, two CVE IDs would be assigned because the two
resource-consumption issues occur for different reasons.
