Vulnerability title: Invalid Pointer Dereference in VMware Workstation and Player
CVE: CVE-2014-2384
Vendor: VMware
Product: Workstation, Player
Affected version: VMware WorkStation v10.0.1 build-1379776 and VMware Player v6.0.1 build-1379776
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou

Details:
The vmx86.sys (32 & 64-bit) kernel mode driver shared by various VMware Windows products such as VMware Workstation and VMWare Player, allows a local attacker to kill the host system through a Blue Screen of Death by sending a specific IOCTL code with a 3 bytes, or larger, input buffer.

The Blue Screen is triggered because the vulnerable function doesnâ€™t check if a pointer to a memory page is valid or not, thus causing a memory access violation by trying to read from an unallocated memory page.

Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerable function in the vmx86.sys driver does not validate a pointer to a memory page before attempting to read from it.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Invalid pointer dereference, leading to a memory access violation.

Impact of exploitation: A local attacker can cause a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) on the host system, leading to a denial of service.

Attack vectors: Sending a specific IOCTL code with a 3-byte or larger input buffer to the vulnerable vmx86.sys kernel mode driver.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the host system.
