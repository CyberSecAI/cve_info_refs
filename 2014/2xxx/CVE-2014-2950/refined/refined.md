Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2950:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Datum Systems SnIP operating system on PSM-4500 and PSM-500 satellite modem devices has FTP enabled by default.
*   No authentication is required to access the FTP service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-220:** Sensitive Data Under FTP Root: The FTP service allows open access to sensitive areas of the file system due to lack of authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can gain full control of the device. This implies potential for:
    *   Reading sensitive data from the file system.
    *   Modifying device configurations.
    *   Potentially disrupting device operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by connecting to the FTP service of the affected device over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the device.
*   No authentication is required, meaning the attacker doesn't need any valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
