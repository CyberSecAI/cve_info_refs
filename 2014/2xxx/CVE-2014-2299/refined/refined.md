    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow exists in the MPEG file parser of Wireshark.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious packet capture file (.pcap) that triggers the buffer overflow when opened by a user.",

      "Ability to create malicious .pcap files",
     "Ability to inject malformed packets onto the network"
