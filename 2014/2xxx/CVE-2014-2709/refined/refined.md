Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input passed to shell commands executed by the `lib/rrd.php` file. Specifically, shell metacharacters in unspecified parameters can be used to inject and execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Command Execution:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Cacti application. This is due to the lack of proper escaping of shell metacharacters before executing commands using the `rrdtool`.
- **Insufficient Input Validation/Sanitization:** The software fails to properly sanitize user-provided input which is later used in shell commands, which enables the command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could grant the attacker complete control over the server, allowing them to perform any action the webserver user can, which includes but isn't limited to, installing malware, stealing data, or disrupting services.
- **System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially compromise the entire system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network, which makes it very dangerous since it doesn't require the attacker to be physically near the target system.
- **Unspecified Parameters:** The exact parameters that are vulnerable are not specified in the CVE description, but the vulnerable code is located in `lib/rrd.php`, indicating shell metacharacters in parameters passed to shell commands called in this file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Cacti server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of which parameters are vulnerable to inject the metacharacters. While not specified in the CVE, this information could be gained by analyzing the code, which is publicly available.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information does not indicate any authentication requirements.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved adding `cacti_escapeshellarg` calls to the `lib/rrd.php` file. This function is intended to properly escape shell metacharacters, which mitigates the command injection vulnerability.
- The fix was part of a larger effort to address multiple security vulnerabilities in Cacti, including SQL injection and XSS issues.
- The vulnerability was present in Cacti versions 0.8.7g, 0.8.8b and earlier.
