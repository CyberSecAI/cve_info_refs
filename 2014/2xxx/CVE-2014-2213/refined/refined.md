Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-2213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation and output escaping in the POSH web application. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the `openrssarticle.php` script is not validated, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities like:
- Stealing cookies and session tokens.
- Defacing the website.
- Redirecting the user to a malicious site.
- Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload in the `id` parameter of `openrssarticle.php`. For example:
`http://host/portal/openrssarticle.php?id=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a victim. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, and the attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects POSH versions from 3.0 to 3.2.1.
- The identified vulnerable files are:
  - `http://host/includes/plugins/mobile/scripts/login.php?error=<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
  - `http://host/portal/openrssarticle.php?id=alert('XSS')`
- The advisory suggests the following solution: validate the `id` parameter (must be integer) and escape html-specific characters when displaying the error message.
