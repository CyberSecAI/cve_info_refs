Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-2370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The web application stores untrusted data which is later read back and included in dynamic content without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks due to its failure to properly sanitize user-supplied data before rendering it in web pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to:
    - Modification of the content displayed on the HMI web interface.
    - Execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser session, potentially exposing sensitive information or taking malicious actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacement of the HMI interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by accessing a web page from the affected device that incorporates unsanitized, attacker-controlled data.
- Attackers could potentially inject malicious code via crafted inputs within the web application's interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to send a request to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker must be authenticated to the web application (indicated by the CVSS v2 access vector of "Au:S" - Single authentication).
- The attacker doesn't require high technical skill to perform the attack, classified by the CVSS access complexity of "AC:L" - Low.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory also mentions a related vulnerability, CVE-2014-2369, which is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- The affected products are Omron NS series HMI terminals, specifically versions 8.1xx through 8.68x.
- Omron has released updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities (Version 8.69x for Japan and Version 8.7x for other countries).
