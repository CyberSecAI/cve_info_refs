Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2043

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to unsanitized user input within the `value` parameter in the `Data.aspx` page. The application fails to sanitize the `value` parameter before using it in an SQL query, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Blind SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection, meaning an attacker might not see the results directly in the response but can still extract data by observing the server's behavior (e.g., response times).
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically the `value` parameter, before using it in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from the database.
- **Access to Credentials:**  Attackers can gain access to usernames and password hashes stored in the database.
- **Potential OS Access:** In certain configurations, a successful attack may lead to access to the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `Data.aspx` page.
- **Manipulated `value` Parameter:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `value` parameter within the URL:  `http[s]://<host>/Resources/System/Templates/Data.aspx?DocID=1&field=JobID&value=1<SQL INJECTION>&JobID=1&ParentDocID=1694&InTab=1&ParentKey=JobNumber&NoStore=1&Popup=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application server.

**Additional Details:**
- **Vulnerable Application:** Procentia IntelliPen version 1.1.12.1520
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.1.18.1658
