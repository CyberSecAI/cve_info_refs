Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-2347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient session management in the AMTELCO miSecureMessage (MSM) system. Specifically, the web service does not adequately prevent modification of message requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Information Exposure (CWE-200):** Due to inadequate session management, a valid user could modify requests to access messages intended for other users. This exposes personally identifiable information (PII).
*  **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** Insufficient authentication complexity might allow an attacker to intercept message traffic between healthcare providers and patients, potentially exposing PII.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to messages intended for other users, including potentially sensitive healthcare and personal information.
*   Exposure of PII, which could lead to privacy violations and potential harm to the individuals involved.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
*   **Web Service:** The vulnerabilities are located in the MSM's web service.
*  **Session Modification:** An attacker needs to modify message requests to exploit the session management vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Valid User Account:** The attacker likely needs to be a valid user of the MSM system.
*   **Moderate Technical Skill:** Crafting an exploit requires a moderate level of technical skill, specifically the ability to modify session-related requests.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected web service.

**Additional details from the advisory:**

*   Exploits are publicly available.
*   The advisory mentions another related CVE-2014-0357, which is associated with the "Improper Authentication" weakness.
