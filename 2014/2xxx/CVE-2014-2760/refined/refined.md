Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer when it improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts with full user rights.
