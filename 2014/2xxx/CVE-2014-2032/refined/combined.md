This is a logic error. It makes no sense to add begin and obj->len.
Use CVE-2014-2031.

# MaraDNS security update

[Previous entry](2014-02-05.html) -
[Next entry](2014-03-14.html) -
[Blog index](/blog/idx.html)
## February 12 2014

Today, I celebrate my anniversary with my wife, release a MaraDNS security
update, and post a couple links given to me in private email.

==**¡Happy Anniversary Marina!**==

The most important thing comes first:

Four years ago today, I had the great honor of marrying the most beautiful
woman in the world. My life is infinitely better than it was when
I was alone. It is a great honor to celebrate four years of marriage
with Marina today. I LOVE YOU! May God continue to bless our marriage.

==**MaraDNS security update**==

I have released MaraDNS 2.0.09, MaraDNS 1.4.14, Deadwood 3.2.05, and
Deadwood 2.3.09. This is an important stability and security update
and all MaraDNS users are encouraged to update at their soonest
convenience.

==**How to download**==

Most MaraDNS users should download MaraDNS 2.0.09, which includes
Deadwood 3.2.05:

> [http://if gt IE 6​endifmaradns.if gt IE 6​endiforg/if gt IE 6​endifdownload/if gt IE 6​endif2.if gt IE 6​endif0/if gt IE 6​endif2.if gt IE 6​endif0.if gt IE 6​endif09](http://maradns.org/download/2.0/2.0.09)

> [https://if gt IE 6​endifsourceforge.if gt IE 6​endifnet/if gt IE 6​endifprojects/if gt IE 6​endifmaradns/if gt IE 6​endiffiles/if gt IE 6​endifMaraif gt IE 6​endifDNS/if gt IE 6​endif2.if gt IE 6​endif0.if gt IE 6​endif09/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maradns/files/MaraDNS/2.0.09/)

The GitHub version of MaraDNS has also been updated (it was actually
the first version to be updated):

> <https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS>

git clone <https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS>

It's also possible to download just Deadwood 3.2.05:

> [http://if gt IE 6​endifmaradns.if gt IE 6​endifsamiam.if gt IE 6​endiforg/if gt IE 6​endifdeadwood/if gt IE 6​endifstable/](http://maradns.samiam.org/deadwood/stable/)

> [https://if gt IE 6​endifsourceforge.if gt IE 6​endifnet/if gt IE 6​endifprojects/if gt IE 6​endifmaradns/if gt IE 6​endiffiles/if gt IE 6​endifDeadwood/if gt IE 6​endif3.if gt IE 6​endif2.if gt IE 6​endif05/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maradns/files/Deadwood/3.2.05/)

People who are still using MaraDNS 1 may download MaraDNS 1.4.14
(source code "tarball" only):

> [http://if gt IE 6​endifmaradns.if gt IE 6​endifsamiam.if gt IE 6​endiforg/if gt IE 6​endifdownload/if gt IE 6​endif1.if gt IE 6​endif4/](http://maradns.samiam.org/download/1.4/)

> [https://if gt IE 6​endifsourceforge.if gt IE 6​endifnet/if gt IE 6​endifprojects/if gt IE 6​endifmaradns/if gt IE 6​endiffiles/if gt IE 6​endifMaraif gt IE 6​endifDNS/if gt IE 6​endif1.if gt IE 6​endif4.if gt IE 6​endif14/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maradns/files/MaraDNS/1.4.14/)

Please note that MaraDNS 1 will stop being supported on June 21, 2015.

For anyone still using Deadwood 2.3, here are links to Deadwood 2.3.09:

> [http://if gt IE 6​endifmaradns.if gt IE 6​endifsamiam.if gt IE 6​endiforg/if gt IE 6​endifdeadwood/if gt IE 6​endiftiny/](http://maradns.samiam.org/deadwood/tiny/)

> [https://if gt IE 6​endifsourceforge.if gt IE 6​endifnet/if gt IE 6​endifprojects/if gt IE 6​endifmaradns/if gt IE 6​endiffiles/if gt IE 6​endifDeadwood/if gt IE 6​endif2.if gt IE 6​endif3.if gt IE 6​endif09/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maradns/files/Deadwood/2.3.09/)

Note that Deadwood 2.3 will stop being supported on June 21, 2016.

==**Description of the problem**==

There has been a long-standing bug in Deadwood (ever since 2007) where
bounds checking for strings was not correctly done under some
circumstances.

Because of this, it has been possible to send Deadwood a "packet of
death" which will crash Deadwood. Since the attack causes
out-of-bounds memory to be read, but not written to, the impact of the
bug is denial of service. It appears this attack can only be exploited
by an IP with permission to perform recursive queries against
Deadwood.

This bug is fixed in Deadwood 3.2.05 and Deadwood 2.3.09. MaraDNS
2.0.09 and 1.4.14 have been updated to include Deadwood 3.2.05.

Note that this bug only affects users of the Deadwood recursive resolver.

CVE number: None

Impact: Remote denial of service

==**My mistake**==

The mistake I have made was to make one of the core string handling
functions an overly complicated "Swiss army knife" function; when it
comes to security, it's better to have two simple functions than one
overly complicated function.

==**VirtualBOX host-only network**==

A few months ago, I posted a
[blog entry](http://samiam.org/blog/20130826.html) showing how to set
up a host-only network, as well as how to edit the registry to work
around a bug in how VirtualBox sets up host-only networks. David gave
me the following link:

> <http://teamchivers.com/?p=48>

==**Updated link for bulk polyhedral dice**==

A couple of years ago, I posted a
[blog entry](http://samiam.org/blog/20120218.html)
on buying bulk polyhedral dice (I was part of a role playing game
campaign at the time). Some of the links in that blog no longer
work (one eBay supplier has since closed up shop) but William Joyner
pointed out this new listing at Amazon:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1066609#c0)  Martin Prpič    2014-02-18 17:27:51 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that MaraDNS's recursive resolver, Deadwood, suffers from a flaw where string bounds checking was not done correctly under certain circumstances. As a result, it was possible for a remote attacker to send Deadwood a "packet of death", which would cause Deadwood to crash. Upstream notes that it currently appears that this attack can only be exploited by an IP address with a permission to perform recursive queries against Deadwood.  It looks like these are the appropriate patches in git:  <https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/commit/f015495d221f1c2b2f10db38e87cecf3839d6093> <https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/commit/2cfcd2397cb8168d4aa4594839fabe88420d03c3>  [1] <http://samiam.org/blog/2014-02-12.html> [2] <http://secunia.com/advisories/57033/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1066609#c1)  Martin Prpič    2014-02-18 17:30:48 UTC  ```  Created maradns tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1066611](show_bug.cgi?id=1066611 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - maradns: DoS due to incorrect bounds checking on certain strings [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 1066612](show_bug.cgi?id=1066612 "CLOSED WONTFIX - maradns: DoS due to incorrect bounds checking on certain strings [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1066609#c2)  Tomasz Torcz    2014-02-18 18:33:52 UTC  ``` F20 update went stable few days ago.
