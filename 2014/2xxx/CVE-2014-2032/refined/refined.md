Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2032:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to missing input validation in Deadwood, the recursive resolver of MaraDNS. This flaw relates to how strings are handled within the software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect string bounds checking. The code does not properly validate the length of input strings under certain circumstances.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS). By sending a specially crafted "packet of death," an attacker can crash the Deadwood service. This crash is due to an out-of-bounds memory read.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious network packet to the affected service. The specific details of the malicious packet are not provided in the document, but the crafted packet triggers the flawed string handling routine, causing the crash.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an IP address with the ability to perform recursive queries against the Deadwood resolver. This suggests that the vulnerability is not exploitable by just anyone, but rather by an attacker with a certain level of network access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability existed in Deadwood since 2007.
- The fix was implemented in Deadwood 3.2.05 and 2.3.09
- MaraDNS 2.0.09 and 1.4.14 have been updated to include the patched Deadwood versions.
- The issue is caused by a complex "Swiss army knife" function handling strings, which would have been better implemented as two separate simple functions.
