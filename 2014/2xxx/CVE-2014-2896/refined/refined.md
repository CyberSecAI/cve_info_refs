Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing buffer length check within the `DoAlert()` function of the wolfSSL CyaSSL library. Specifically, the code does not properly validate the length of an input buffer before reading from it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation (CWE-20):** The lack of a buffer length check is a classic example of improper input validation, which allows an attacker to potentially influence the read index.
- **Memory Corruption:** By manipulating the input, an attacker can force the read index to go up to 2 bytes beyond the intended buffer boundary, which can corrupt memory or cause an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The primary impact is the possibility of memory corruption.
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The improper handling of the read index could lead to an out-of-bounds read.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the `DoAlert()` function of the TLS or DTLS implementation within the wolfSSL library. An attacker can craft specific inputs to trigger the missing buffer length check.
- The vulnerability can likely be exploited by sending malformed alerts within TLS or DTLS traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a target using a vulnerable version of the CyaSSL library. This implies that the attacker would need to be in a position to act as either a malicious client or server and control the alerts being sent within a TLS or DTLS connection.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory from wolfSSL clearly identifies the issue as memory corruption due to improper input validation.
- The advisory also specifies the affected versions as CyaSSL 2.9.0 and earlier, and that the issue was fixed in CyaSSL 2.9.4.
- Google's security team discovered this vulnerability.
