```

Hello,

```
<https://bugs.mageia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12770> notes that imapsync 1.584
fixes a security issue, "Bug fix: Check if going to tls is ok, exit
otherwise with explicit error message. Thanks to Dennis Schridde for
reporting this ugly bug that deserves a CVE."
```

Upstream bug: <https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/issues/15>

Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already?

Thanks,

```

There seems to be a possibility of at least two separate issues.
First, the product ends up trying a cleartext login even though
the --tls option is provided on the command line. This is assigned
CVE-2014-2014. (Moving to a cleartext session in reaction to a
certificate-verification failure would typically always be wrong for
any product.)

Second, the product is trying a cleartext login even though the server
sent LOGINDISABLED. RFC 3501 section 6.2.3 says "A client
implementation MUST NOT send a LOGIN command if the LOGINDISABLED
capability is advertised."

(The discussion also reported a third problem: "The user is never
notified of the certificate issue." That one is most likely, by
itself, outside the scope of CVE. If a product refused to operate in
an unsafe certificate situation, and did not tell the user why it was
refusing, that would potentially be a usability problem. That would
not be an independent vulnerability that could have a CVE ID.)

The patch in:

  <https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/commit/7d2043f95f42122c2ae3340053f893095efe1550>

seems to change:

   $imap->starttls(  ) if ( $imap->Tls(  ) ) ;

to:

   if ( $imap->Tls(  ) ) {
          $imap->starttls(  )
          or die_clean("Can not go to tls encryption on [$host]:", $imap->LastError, "\n" ) ;
   }

in two places.

The second issue (proceeding when LOGINDISABLED is advertised) would
also be relevant if it occurred when the client did not include --tls
on the command line. If anyone has observed that, a second CVE ID
could be assigned. This is a protocol violation with security
implications. Compliant client software is supposed to look for
LOGINDISABLED in all cases, presumably including cases in which the
end user is not explicitly requesting a TLS session.

Finally, <https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/issues/15> ends with

   there's still something weird, since I found that:

   --ssl1 --tls2 fails on host2 login with "Unable to start TLS: Cannot determine peer hostname for verification"
   --tls1 --tls2 succeeds
   --tls2 succeeds
   --tls1 --ssl2 succeeds

We couldn't immediately determine if that's simply a functionality
problem, or whether another vulnerability exists (e.g., if the correct
behavior were "fails" in all four cases, but with some combinations of
command-line options, there's no attempt to check a server hostname).

## Description

[![@devurandom](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63082?v=4&size=48)](/devurandom)[devurandom](https://github.com/devurandom)opened [on Jan 19, 2014](https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync/issues/15#issue-25886460)

Currently there seems to be no STARTTLS support in imapsync, is that correct? `--tls1/2` on my system still results in (excerpt from output):

```
Info: will try to use LOGIN authentication on host1
Host1: IMAP server [$HOST1] port [$PORT1] user [$USER1]
Host1: * OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 LITERAL+ SASL-IR LOGIN-REFERRALS ID ENABLE IDLE STARTTLS LOGINDISABLED] Dovecot ready.
Host1: $HOST1 says it has NO CAPABILITY for AUTHENTICATE LOGIN
Failure: error login on [$HOST1] with user [$USER1] auth [LOGIN]: 4 NO [PRIVACYREQUIRED] Plaintext authentication disallowed on non-secure (SSL/TLS) connections.

```
