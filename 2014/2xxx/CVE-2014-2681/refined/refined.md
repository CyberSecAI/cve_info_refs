Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2681:

**CVE-2014-2681**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sufficient protection against XML External Entity (XXE) injection attacks within certain functions of the Zend Framework. This is due to an incomplete fix from a previous vulnerability (CVE-2012-5657). Specifically, the framework was not properly sanitizing or preventing the use of external entities in XML documents processed by `simplexml_load_*`, `DOMDocument::loadXML`, and `xml_parse` functions.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **XXE Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to XXE attacks. This occurs because the XML parser, by default, allows external entities, which can be used to load arbitrary files or initiate TCP connections.
    *   **Incomplete Fix:** The vulnerability exists because a prior attempt to fix a similar issue (in CVE-2012-5657) was not comprehensive, leaving some attack vectors open.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker could potentially read files from the server's file system that the web server process has access to.
    *  **Denial of Service:** By including recursive or circular references within XML entity definitions, an attacker can cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), leading to a denial-of-service condition.
    *   **TCP Connections:** An attacker might be able to cause the server to make arbitrary TCP connections to other systems.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious XML documents that include a DOCTYPE element containing references to external entities.
    *   These malicious documents would be processed via functions such as `simplexml_load_*`, `DOMDocument::loadXML`, or `xml_parse`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to submit/inject XML data into the application using vulnerable framework components.
    *   The attacker doesn't need any specific system privileges, just the ability to trigger the parsing of a malicious XML document.
*  **Affected Versions:**
    *  Primarily affects Zend Framework 1.x but other versions of the framework, including Zend Framework 2, were patched to prevent the same issue.

**Summary of Fix:**

The fix involves using `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` to disable the loading of external entities and checking for ENTITY elements in the document type declaration, throwing an exception if they are found. For PHP-FPM scenarios, a heuristic approach was also implemented, searching the XML string for `<!ENTITY` elements and throwing exceptions.

The patches were applied in:

*   Zend Framework 1, version 1.12.4
*   Zend Framework 2, versions 2.1.6 and 2.2.6
