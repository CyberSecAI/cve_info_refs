Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insecure firmware update mechanism employed by ASUS RT-series wireless routers. The routers retrieve firmware updates and associated version information via unencrypted HTTP from `dlcdnet.asus.com`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Communication:** The routers use plain HTTP for both downloading the firmware version lookup file and the actual firmware binary. This exposes the communication to eavesdropping and manipulation.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checks:** There's no verification of the authenticity or integrity of the downloaded files. The router doesn't ensure it's communicating with a legitimate ASUS server nor does it verify that the downloaded data hasn't been tampered with.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Downgrade Attacks:** An attacker can force the router to install an older, vulnerable firmware version. This may allow the exploitation of known vulnerabilities present in the older firmware.
*   **Malicious Firmware Injection:** The vulnerability can also be used to deliver a completely custom, malicious firmware image to the router. This gives an attacker full control over the device.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** A MITM attacker can intercept the HTTP requests and responses, modifying the firmware version information to point to malicious firmware and/or injecting their malicious firmware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker positioned in between the router and the internet, such as on the same local network or an upstream network provider.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the router and the ASUS update server, i.e. be in a MITM position.
*   **HTTP Manipulation:** The attacker needs the capability to manipulate HTTP responses to change the advertised latest firmware version and to inject their own malicious firmware binary.

**Affected Devices:**
The following ASUS router models are confirmed to be affected: RT-AC68U, RT-AC68U, RT-AC66R, RT-AC66U, RT-AC56R, RT-AC56U, RT-N66R, RT-N66U, RT-N56R, RT-N56U. It is also suspected to affect RT-N53, RT-N14U, RT-N16, and RT-N16R.

**Mitigation:**
This vulnerability was addressed in the 376 firmware branch (3.0.0.4.376.x)
