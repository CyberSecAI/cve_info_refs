Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the PPP Access Concentrator (PPPAC) functionality of SEIL series routers.
- Specifically, it is caused by an issue in how the routers process certain, specially crafted TCP packets during TCP MSS auto-adjustment (tcp-mss-adjust).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is a buffer error (CWE-119).
- Incorrect handling of TCP packets during the MSS adjustment process leads to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the `npppd` daemon, which provides the PPPAC functionality, to terminate abnormally.
- This leads to the disconnection of all existing PPPAC sessions.
- It can also prevent the establishment of new PPPAC connections, thus resulting in a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, involving the transmission of specially crafted TCP packets.
- The attacker needs to send these packets to the affected SEIL router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the targeted SEIL router.
- They need to be capable of crafting and sending malicious TCP packets.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
