- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The `AddStdLetter.jsp` file is vulnerable to script injection through the `description` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious script into the `description` parameter of the vulnerable `AddStdLetter.jsp` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request containing the malicious script to the vulnerable endpoint. The user also needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable page.
