### Overview

MicroPact iComplaints contains a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability.

### Description

| [**CWE-79**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**  MicroPact iComplaints contains a persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability. The AddStdLetter.jsp file is vulnerable to script injection through the description parameter. |
| --- |

| --- |

### Solution

| This issue has been patched in iComplaints version 8.0.2.1.8.8014. If you are unable to upgrade, please consider the following workaround: |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Note that restricting access does not prevent XSS or CSRF attacks since the attack comes as an HTTP request from a legitimate user's host. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the iComplaints interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
