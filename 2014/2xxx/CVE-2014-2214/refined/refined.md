Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2214:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the `redirect` parameter within the `/posh/portal/scr_sendmd5.php` script. This script is responsible for sending password reset links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Arbitrary URL Redirection (CWE-601):** The application allows an attacker to control the redirection URL, which is passed via the `redirect` parameter in a POST request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing/Malicious Redirection:** An attacker could craft a malicious link that, upon being clicked, redirects the user to a phishing site or a site hosting malware. This can trick users into divulging sensitive information or infecting their systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted POST request to the `/posh/portal/scr_sendmd5.php` endpoint.
- **`redirect` Parameter:** The attacker uses the `redirect` parameter in the POST data to specify the target URL for redirection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, requiring only network access to the vulnerable POSH application.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to send an HTTP POST request with specific parameters.

**Additional Details:**

- The advisory provides the vulnerable code snippet in a POST request.
- The `redirect` parameter is used without sanitization or validation, allowing for arbitrary redirection.
- The advisory suggests two solutions: to either allow redirection only to known pages or to remove any leading '/'.

**Affected Versions:**

- POSH versions 3.0 to 3.2.1 are affected.
