Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The embedded Winstone servlet container in Jenkins is susceptible to session hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session hijacking vulnerability in the Winstone servlet container.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially hijack user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct HTTP access to the Jenkins server.
- Exploitation requires the ability to override Jenkins cookies in a victim's browser, typically through a Man-in-the-Middle attack or similar network-level access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs direct HTTP access to the Jenkins server.
- Additionally, the attacker needs the ability to override cookies in the victim's browser, implying a MitM position or similar network-level access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "high" in severity because an attacker with HTTP access can mount this attack.
- The fix involved updating the version of the Winstone component (specifically, from version `0.9.10-jenkins-43` to `0.9.10-jenkins-48`).
- While the vulnerability itself is straightforward, its practical relevance might be limited by the need for an attacker to manipulate cookies, which typically requires additional network capabilities.
- The unusual threat model of needing to override cookies might limit the practical relevance of the issue.
