Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2064:

**CVE Description:**
The vulnerability relates to a user enumeration issue in Jenkins. Specifically, the application reveals the presence or absence of users during failed login attempts.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that Jenkins' user database reveals the existence of users through different error messages for valid/invalid usernames. This allows an attacker to determine valid usernames by observing different error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **User Enumeration:** The primary weakness is that Jenkins distinguishes between a non-existent user and an existing user with an incorrect password. This allows attackers to identify valid usernames, making it easier to conduct further attacks (e.g., brute force password guessing).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain a list of valid usernames on the Jenkins instance.
*   **Increased Attack Surface:** Valid usernames make it easier for an attacker to attempt password-based attacks.
*   **Reduced Security:** The enumeration vulnerability decreases the overall security of the Jenkins platform.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Login Page:** The vulnerability is present on the Jenkins login page.
*   **Observation of Error Messages:** The attacker simply observes the error messages given for invalid usernames vs. valid usernames with incorrect passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance to interact with the login page.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the system.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any specific permissions on Jenkins to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided GitHub commit ([https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/fbf96734470caba9364f04e0b77b0bae7293a1ec](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/fbf96734470caba9364f04e0b77b0bae7293a1ec)) shows the code change to address this vulnerability. The fix modifies the authentication process to return a generic "Bad credentials" message, regardless of whether the username is valid or not.

*   This CVE was rated "low" severity.

In summary, CVE-2014-2064 is a user enumeration vulnerability that can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with access to the Jenkins login page to discover valid usernames, thereby increasing the overall attack surface of the Jenkins instance.
