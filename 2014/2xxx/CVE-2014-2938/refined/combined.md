## Hanvon facial recognition (Face ID) devices do not authenticate commands

#### Vulnerability Note VU#767044

Original Release Date: 2014-05-20 | Last Revised: 2014-05-20

---

### Overview

Hanvon facial recognition (Face ID) devices possibly running software versions prior to 1.007.110 could allow an unauthenticated attacker to modify user and access control information.

### Description

| [CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/306.html)  It has been reported that Hanvon biometric facial recognition devices running software versions prior to 1.007.110 do not authenticate network connections or API commands. Hanvon devices provide a plain-text management protocol/API on port 9922/tcp. An attacker with network access can connect to devices using telnet or a similar terminal or TCP socket utility, with no authentication.It has been reported the following devices are affected: F710, F810, FA007, FK800, and earlier series. It is possible that all Hanvon facial recognition devices could be affected. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker with network access to vulnerable devices on 9922/tcp could create, modify, and delete user and access control information. This could allow the attacker to bypass authentication and authorization for physical access or time and attendance tracking. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**It has been reported that this vulnerability has been addressed in software version 1.007.110. Affected users are advised to contact their device provider, integrator, or Hanvon to obtain updated software. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Consider running sensitive access control systems on a separate network. |
