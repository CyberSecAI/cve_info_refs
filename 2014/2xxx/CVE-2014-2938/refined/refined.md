- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Hanvon facial recognition devices do not authenticate network connections or API commands. The devices provide a plain-text management protocol/API on port 9922/tcp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for critical functions (CWE-306). Specifically, the lack of authentication for the management API allows unauthenticated access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can create, modify, and delete user and access control information. This could lead to bypassing authentication and authorization for physical access or time and attendance tracking.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the device on port 9922/tcp, using telnet or similar utilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable devices. No prior authentication is required.
