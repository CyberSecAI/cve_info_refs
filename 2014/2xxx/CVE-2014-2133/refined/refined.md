Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a memory corruption issue within the LZW decompression functionality of the Cisco WebEx ARF Player. Specifically, there is an error in how the player handles LZW compressed data within ARF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary weakness is an exploitable flaw that leads to memory corruption when decompressing LZW data. This memory corruption can be triggered by specially crafted ARF files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can lead to the crash of the WebEx ARF Player application, resulting in a denial of service for the user.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some cases, this vulnerability could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system. This means an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the affected machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious ARF File:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious ARF file designed to trigger the memory corruption during the LZW decompression process.
*   **Delivery Methods:**
    *   **Direct Delivery:** Attackers can directly send the malicious ARF file to users via methods like email or file sharing.
    *   **Malicious Web Page:** Attackers can host the malicious ARF file on a website and lure victims into accessing it through a webpage redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Position:** Attackers can be located anywhere, as the vulnerability is triggered when a user opens the malicious file, it is not directly network based.
*   **Ability to Create Malicious ARF Files:** Attackers need the technical ability to create specially crafted ARF files that can trigger the memory corruption vulnerability within the WebEx ARF Player.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory also includes a list of affected products and versions, details on how to verify if a system is vulnerable, and fixed software versions.
*   The advisory notes that the vulnerability cannot be triggered by users attending a WebEx meeting, but only when a malicious ARF file is opened.
*   The advisory specifies workarounds, such as uninstalling the WebEx software using the Meeting Services Removal Tool. However, the proper remediation is to update the software to the fixed versions.
*   The advisory confirms the vulnerability was reported by Fortinet.
