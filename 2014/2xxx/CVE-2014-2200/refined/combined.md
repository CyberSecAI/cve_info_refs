Details  * Cisco NX-OS Virtual Device Context SSH Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityCisco NX-OS-Based devices contain a privilege escalation vulnerability when multiple virtual device contexts (VDC) exist on the system and local authentication has been configured. A remote, authenticated attacker that can access the management interfaces via SSH of an affected device could authenticate in such a way as to obtain the privileges of an administrator in another VDC. Under certain conditions this may allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected device.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCti11629](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCti11629) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2200.Cisco NX-OS Virtual Device Context SSH Key Privilege Escalation VulnerabilityCisco NX-OS-Based devices contain a privilege escalation vulnerability when multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs) exist on the system and local authentication has been configured. A remote, authenticated attacker who can access the SSH management interfaces of an affected device could manipulate the login information supplied as part of the SSH key file to exploit the vulnerability. This could allow the attacker to obtain the privileges of an administrator in another VDC. Under certain conditions, this may allow the attacker to take complete control of the affected device.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud88400](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud88400) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2013-1191.Cisco NX-OS-Based Products Smart Call Home Buffer Overflow VulnerabilityCisco NX-OS-Based products that support the Smart Call Home feature set are affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability. An unauthenticated, remote attacker who can obtain control of a configured SMTP server could trigger a buffer overflow condition. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the affected device.      This vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize input received from remote hosts while sending a Smart Call Home notification.      Devices running an affected version of software contain the vulnerability, these devices are only at risk if they have configured Smart Call Home to utilize SMTP reporting.      This vulnerability is documented in the following Cisco bug IDs:   + **Cisco Unified Computing System Fabric Interconnects** - [CSCtk00695](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtk00695) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 3000** - [CSCts56633](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts56633) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 5000** - [CSCts56632](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts56632) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 7000** - [CSCts56628](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCts56628) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Nexus 4000** - [CSCug14405](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug14405) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)   + **Cisco Connected 1000 Series Connected Grid Routers running CG-OS** - [CSCuf61322](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf61322) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only)The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-3261.Cisco NX-OS Message Transfer Service Denial of Service Vulnerability*Further engineering efforts have determined that no officially released images are affected by this vulnerability. Customers running a pre-release version of NX-OS 6.0 may be affected and are advised to update to an official release.*   A vulnerability in the Message Transfer Service (MTS) of version 6.0(1) of Cisco NX-OS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference that may occur when an affected device is under a heavy load. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a significant amount of specially designed traffic to trigger the condition. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a kernel panic, resulting in a DoS condition.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtw98915](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtw98915) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2201.  Workarounds  * No workarounds are available.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       **Cisco Unified Computing System:**   Cisco NX-OS-Based Products Smart Call Home Buffer Overflow Vulnerability      | **Affected Version** | **First Fixed Release** | **Recommended Release** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 1.0 | N/A | 2.2(1d) |   | 1.1 | N/A | 2.2(1d) |   | 1.2 | N/A | 2.2(1d) |   | 1.3 | N/A | 2.2(1d) |   | 1.4(1h) and prior | 1.4(1i) | 2.2(1d) |            **Cisco Nexus 7000:**   Cisco NX-OS Virtual Device Context SSH Privilege Escalation Vulnerability      | Affected Version | First Fixed Release> | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 4.X | N/A | 6.2(8) |   | 5.0(2a) and prior | 5.0(5) | 6.2(8) |         Cisco NX-OS Virtual Device Context SSH Key Privilege Escalation Vulnerability      | Affected Version | First Fixed Release | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 4.X | N/A | 6.2(8) |   | 5.X | N/A | 6.2(8) |   | 6.0 | N/A | 6.2(8) |   | 6.1(4a) and prior | 6.1(5) | 6.2(8) |         Cisco NX-OS-Based Products Smart Call Home Buffer Overflow Vulnerability      | **Affected Version** | **First Fixed Release** | **Recommended Release** |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 4.X | N/A | 6.2(8) |   | 5.0 | N/A | 6.2(8) |   | 5.1 | N/A | 6.2(8) |   | 5.2(3) and prior | 5.2(3a) | 6.2(8) |            **Cisco Nexus 5000:**   Cisco NX-OS-Based Products Smart Call Home Buffer Overflow Vulnerability      | Affected Version | First Fixed Release | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 4.X | N/A | 5.2(1)N1(7) 6.0(2)N2(4) 7.0(2)N1(1) |   | 5.0 | 5.1(3)N1(1) | 5.2(1)N1(7) 6.0(2)N2(4) 7.0(2)N1(1) |         **Cisco Nexus 4000:**   Cisco NX-OS-Based Products Smart Call Home Buffer Overflow Vulnerability      | Affected Version | First Fixed Release | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 4.1(2)E1(1k) and prior | 4.1(2)E1(1l) | 4.1(2)E1(1l) |         **Cisco Nexus 3000:**   Cisco NX-OS-Based Products Smart Call Home Buffer Overflow Vulnerability      | Affected Version | First Fixed Release | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | 5.0(3)U2(1) and prior | 5.0(3)U2(2) | 5.0(3)U5(1j) 6.0(2)U2(4) |         **Cisco 1000 Series Connected Grid Router:**   Cisco NX-OS-Based Products Smart Call Home Buffer Overflow Vulnerability      | Affected Version | First Fixed Release | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- | --- |   | CG3 | N/A | CG4(3) 15.4(1)CG |   | CG4(1) | CG4(2) | CG4(3) 15.4(1)CG |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |
