Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Cisco NX-OS-based devices handle multiple virtual device contexts (VDCs) when local authentication is configured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user in one VDC can gain administrative privileges in another VDC.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially gain complete control of the affected device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access via SSH:** An attacker needs remote access to the management interface of the affected device through SSH.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must have valid credentials to log in to the device.
- **Multiple VDCs:** The device must have multiple virtual device contexts configured for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
- **Local Authentication:** Local authentication must be configured for the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a remote, authenticated user.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the affected system's configuration and how to manipulate authentication processes between VDCs.
