  "CVE-2014-2708": {
    "description": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in graph_xport.php in Cacti 0.8.7g, 0.8.8b, and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) graph_start, (2) graph_end, (3) graph_height, (4) graph_width, (5) graph_nolegend, (6) print_source, (7) local_graph_id, or (8) rra_id parameter.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the graph_xport.php file, which allows an attacker to inject SQL commands.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves sending crafted requests to graph_xport.php via URL parameters such as graph_start, graph_end, graph_height, graph_width, graph_nolegend, print_source, local_graph_id, or rra_id"

    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web server running Cacti."

    "description": "lib/rrd.php in Cacti 0.8.7g, 0.8.8b, and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in unspecified parameters.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the insufficient sanitization of user-provided input before being used in shell commands.",
