Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2397:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `MethodHandle` class of OpenJDK, specifically how it handles variable argument lists when permuting or dropping arguments. The classfile parser did not properly parse class files with an invalid BootstrapMethods attribute length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The `MethodHandle` class does not properly handle the variable argument lists, leading to unexpected behavior. The class file parser does not validate the `BootstrapMethods` attribute length.
- **Java Sandbox Bypass:** Due to the vulnerability, an untrusted Java application or applet could potentially bypass Java sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the Java Virtual Machine.
- **Sandbox Bypass:** An attacker could bypass Java sandbox restrictions, potentially gaining access to resources they shouldn't have.
- **Memory Corruption:** The flaws can trigger Java Virtual Machine memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Untrusted Java Code:** The vulnerability can be exploited by untrusted Java applications or applets.
- **Network-based Attacks:** In some cases, if the browser plugin provided by icedtea-web was installed, Java applets could be exploited without user interaction by a user visiting a malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Deploy/Execute Malicious Java Code:** An attacker needs to be able to get malicious java code to be executed by a vulnerable JVM. This can be achieved via untrusted Java applications, applets or malicious websites.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in OpenJDK 7u55 and 8u5 as well as IcedTea 2.4.7 and IcedTea6 1.13.3.
- Multiple Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) address this CVE across different versions of RHEL.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 9.3 in HP-UX systems, due to the combination of impact and medium attack complexity, while some sources specify a base score of 7.5.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable in client-only installations where the java server is not installed.

This analysis provides more specific details compared to the original CVE description, including the exact vulnerable component (`MethodHandle`), details about the variable argument list handling issue, and potential attack vectors.
