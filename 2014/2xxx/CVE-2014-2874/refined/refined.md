This document describes multiple vulnerabilities in PaperThin CommonSpot CMS and is not related to a specific CVE. Therefore, the content does not relate to CVE-2014-2874, which is a placeholder.

The following vulnerabilities were identified:

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing')**: Many individual CFM pages that comprise CommonSpot are directly accessible, bypassing intended usage patterns.
*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**: Many pages reflect user-supplied input back in the HTTP response, sometimes without proper sanitization, allowing for XSS attacks.
*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control**: Access controls are inconsistently enforced, allowing anonymous users to access sensitive pages.
*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization**: The system fails to properly authorize users before executing potentially dangerous actions.
*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path**: Some pages accept fully-qualified file system paths as parameters.
*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')**: Some pages are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.
*   **CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character**: Some pages may terminate attacker-provided strings prematurely, which when combined with CWE-22, can allow for control of a file path.
*   **CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security**: Client-side JavaScript is used for security enforcement, which can be bypassed.
*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**: Authenticated users can upload arbitrary ColdFusion pages, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter**: ColdFusion variables can be overridden via HTTP GET parameters.
*   **CWE-200: Information Exposure**: Some pages disclose sensitive server information.
*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information**: CommonSpot stores cleartext credentials in its database by default.
*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**: Login pages transmit credentials in cleartext.
*   **CWE-548: Information Exposure Through Directory Listing**: Some pages allow for arbitrary directory listings.
*    **CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files**: The log file directory is accessible without authentication.
*   **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')**: The system allows unauthenticated arbitrary command execution.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerabilities arise from various issues including insufficient input validation, inconsistent access control, improper authorization, and reliance on client-side security mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the server, as well as disclosure of sensitive information, data modification, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by directly accessing vulnerable CFM pages, manipulating HTTP parameters, uploading malicious files, and injecting malicious code into web pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. Some attacks may require the attacker to have knowledge of specific directory structures or page names.
