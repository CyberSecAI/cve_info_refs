CVE-2014-2126,CVE-2014-2127,CVE-2014-2128,CVE-2014-2129       Email      Summary  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is affected by the following vulnerabilities:  Affected Products  * Cisco ASA Software running on the following products is affected by multiple vulnerabilities:   + Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security     Appliances   + Cisco ASA 5500-X Series Next-Generation Firewalls   + Cisco ASA     Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600     Series Routers   + Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   Affected releases of Cisco ASA Software will   vary depending on the specific vulnerability. Consult the "Software   Versions and Fixes" section of this security advisory for more   information about the affected releases.   Vulnerable Products**Cisco ASA ASDM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability** Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability   if Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) access is enabled and there is at least one user with   privilege level 0 in the Cisco ASA local user database.  To   verify whether Cisco ASDM access is configured, use the **show running-config   http** command and verify that the HTTP server is enabled. The following example   shows a Cisco ASA with the Cisco ASDM access enabled:    ```   asa# show running-config http    http server enable   ```  To   verify whether any user in the Cisco ASA local user database has been   assigned privilege level 0, use the **show running-config username |   include privilege 0** command and verify that the command returns output. The   following example shows a Cisco ASA Software configured with the user *cisco1* with privilege level 0 assigned.    ```   asa# show running-config username | include privilege 0   username cisco1 password jmINXNH6p1BxUppp encrypted privilege 0   ``` **Note:** Privilege level 0 is not assigned by default to any user.  **Cisco ASA SSL VPN Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if the Cisco ASA Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN feature is enabled.       To determine whether the SSL VPN is enabled use the **show running-config webvpn** command.       The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the SSL VPN feature enabled on the *outside* interface:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn        webvpn        enable outside         ``` **Note:** Cisco ASA SSL VPN is disabled by default.       **Cisco ASA SSL VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability if all the following conditions are met:   + Cisco ASA Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN     is enabled   + The **authorization-required** command is *not* present under the general attribute configuration of the tunnel group used for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPNTo determine whether the Cisco ASA SSL VPN feature is enabled, use the **show running-config webvpn** command.       The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with the SSL VPN feature enabled on the *outside* interface: ```   ciscoasa# show running-config webvpn        webvpn        enable outside         ``` To determine whether the **authorization-required** command is configured under the general attribute of a tunnel group, use the **show running-config tunnel-group**  command. The following example shows a Cisco ASA configured with a tunnel group *Clientless* that use AAA for authentication and without the **authorization-required** command:    ```   ciscoasa# show running-config tunnel-group Clientlesstunnel-group Clientless type remote-accesstunnel-group Clientless general-attributes authentication-server-group AAA_RADIUS authorization-server-group AAA_RADIUS[...]tunnel-group Clientless webvpn-attributes authentication aaa[...]   ```   **Note:** Cisco ASA SSL VPN is disabled by default. Devices running Cisco ASA Software releases prior to 8.4 are not affected by this vulnerability when both the following conditions are met:   + The Cisco HostScan feature is enabled   + Certificate-only authentication is used for SSL VPN authentication   **Cisco ASA SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Cisco ASA Software is affected by this vulnerability   if the SIP inspection engine is configured. To determine whether SIP   inspection is enabled, use the **show service-policy | include sip** command.   The following example shows Cisco ASA Software with SIP inspection   enabled:  ```   ciscoasa# show service-policy | include sip         Inspect: sip , packet 67, drop 0, reset-drop 0   ``` **Note:** SIP inspection functionality is enabled by default.    Determining the Running Software VersionTo determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco ASA Software is running on an appliance, administrators can issue the **show version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco ASA Software version 8.4(1): ```   ciscoasa#show version | include VersionCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software Version 8.4(1) Device Manager Version 6.4(1)   ``` Customers who use the Cisco ASDM to manage devices can locate the software   version in the table that is displayed in the login window or the upper-left   corner of the Cisco ASDM window.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software is the operating system   used by the Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances, the   Cisco ASA 5500-X Next Generation Firewall, the Cisco ASA Services Module   (ASASM) for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series   Routers, and the Cisco ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall. The Cisco ASA family   provides network security services such as firewall, intrusion   prevention system (IPS), anti-X, and VPN.      **Cisco ASA ASDM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in code that handles privilege assignment when the   Cisco ASA device is accessed using the Cisco ASDM could allow an authenticated, remote   attacker to elevate privileges and gain administrative access to the affected   system.      The vulnerability is due to improper privilege assignment   to users with privilege level 0. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by logging in to the Cisco ASDM with user credentials with   privilege level 0. An exploit could allow the attacker or an unprivileged user   to elevate the access privileges and gain administrative access to the affected   system.      **Note:** Only traffic destined to the affected device can be used to   exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA   Software configured in routed or transparent firewall mode and single or   multiple context mode. This vulnerability can be triggered by IP version 4 (IPv4) and   IP version 6 (IPv6) traffic. A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this   vulnerability.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuj33496](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuj33496) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2126.         **Cisco ASA SSL VPN Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the code that handles management session information could   allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate the assigned privilege   and gain administrative access to the affected system.      The   vulnerability is due to improper validation of user privileges when   users are connected to the SSL VPN portal by using the Clientless SSL VPN   feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to   the SSL VPN portal and submitting crafted URLs. An exploit   could allow the attacker or an unprivileged user to elevate privileges   and gain administrative access to the affected system.   **Note:** Only traffic destined to the affected device can be used to   exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA   Software configured in routed firewall mode and single context mode only. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and   IPv6 traffic. A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this   vulnerability.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCul70099](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCul70099) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2127.      **Cisco ASA SSL VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**    A vulnerability in the SSL VPN code could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access   the SSL VPN portal web page. The   vulnerability is due to improper handling of authentication cookies   when the Cisco ASA SSL VPN feature is enabled. An   attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manually modifying the HTTP   POST body with a forged cookie value or entering a crafted URL. An   exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated access to the SSL VPN Portal page. Depending on the SSL VPN configuration, the attacker may also start a VPN tunnel by using Cisco AnyConnect.      In all cases, the attacker may gain unauthorized access to internal network resources.      **Note:** Only traffic destined to the affected device can be used to   exploit this vulnerability. This vulnerability affects Cisco ASA   Software configured in routed firewall mode and single context mode only. This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and   IPv6 traffic. A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this   vulnerability.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCua85555](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua85555) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2128.      **Cisco ASA SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability**    A vulnerability in the SIP inspection engine code   could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust available   memory, which may cause instability or a reload of the affected system. The   vulnerability is due to improper handling of SIP packets inspected by   the Cisco ASA SIP inspection engine. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by sending crafted SIP packets through the affected   system. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the exhaustion of   available memory. This may cause system instability and in some cases   lead to a reload of the affected system, creating a denial of service   condition.      **Note:** Only transit traffic that is inspected by the Cisco ASA SIP   inspection engine can be used to exploit this vulnerability. This   vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed and   transparent firewall mode and single or multiple context mode.   This vulnerability can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh44052](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh44052) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2129.  Workarounds  * **Cisco ASA ASDM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**  To workaround this vulnerability, administrators can assign privilege level 1 instead of privilege level 0 to users. The privilege assignment can be overridden by reapplying the command with the new privilege level.  The   following example shows how to change the privilege level for the user   *cisco1* in the Cisco ASA local user database from level 0 to level 1.    ```   asa(config)# username cisco1 password  privilege 1    ```  **Note:** This command will override the password value as well. Depending on the specific configuration, assigning privilege level 1 instead of privilege level 0 may allow authorization to commands that user with privilege level 0 would normally not have access to. Customers should carefully evaluate of the workaround is acceptable in their environment.      **Cisco ASA SSL VPN Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**      There is no workaround that mitigates this vulnerability other than disabling the SSL VPN feature.         **Cisco ASA SSL VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability** The Cisco ASA Dynamic Access Policy (DAP) feature can be used as a workaround to   terminate any connection that does not have a username by creating a DAP   record that contains the terminate action, and is selected based on the   following advanced selection rule: **aaa.cisco.username == ""**  This workaround applies to all vulnerable releases. **Note:** This workaround could break deployments that allow nameless sessions to   be created. This will occur when certificate-only   authentication is used and the Cisco ASA is not configured to   extract a username from the user’s certificate.          **Cisco ASA SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability**      Disabling SIP inspection will mitigate this vulnerability.       The following commands will disable the SIP inspection that is configured by default:     ```   ciscoasa(config)# policy-map global_policyciscoasa(config-pmap)# class inspection_defaultciscoasa(config-pmap-c)# no inspect sip    ```  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       In February   2014, Cisco announced details of an industry-wide issue with memory   components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010.   Although the majority of Cisco products that use these components are   experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, a device reload   or power cycle could expose component failures. While there are no known   security implications associated with this issue, a subset of the   affected products may experience a memory component failure during the   software upgrade process. Cisco recommends customers review the related   information and product-specific field notices at [www.cisco.com/go/memory](http://www.cisco.com/go/memory)   before making upgrade decisions. Each Field Notice indicates whether   the product could experience the memory component failure during a   software upgrade. Each row of the following Cisco ASA Software table lists the first fixed   release for each of the vulnerabilities described in this advisory for each Cisco ASA major release. The   last row of the table gives information about the release version that   includes the fix for all the vulnerabilities described in this advisory   for each Cisco ASA major release. Customers should upgrade to a   release that is equal to or later than these release versions.      |  | **7.01** | **7.11** | **7.2** | **8.0**1**** | **8.1**1**** | **8.2** | **8.3** | **8.4** | **8.5** | **8.6** | **8.7** | **9.0** | **9.1** | **9.2** |   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | Cisco ASA ASDM Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - CSCuj33496 | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | 8.2(5.47) | Not Affected | 8.4(7.5) | Not Affected | Not Affected | 8.7(1.11) | 9.0(3.10) | 9.1(3.4) | Not Affected |   | Cisco ASA SSL VPN Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - CSCul70099 | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Migrate to 8.2.x or later | Migrate to 8.2.x or later | 8.2(5.48) | 8.3(2.40) | 8.4(7.9) | Not Affected | 8.6(1.13) | Not Affected | 9.0(4.1) | 9.1(4.3) | Not Affected |   | Cisco ASA SSL VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CSCua85555 | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | 8.2(5.47) | 8.3(2.40) | 8.4(7.3) | Not Affected | 8.6(1.13) | Not Affected | 9.0(3.8) | 9.1(3.2) | Not Affected |   | Cisco ASA SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability - CSCuh44052 | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | 8.2(5.48) | Not Affected | 8.4(6.5) | Not Affected | Not Affected | Not Affected | 9.0(3.1) | 9.1(2.5) | Not Affected |   | **Recommended release that fixes all the vulnerabilities in this security advisory** | **Not Affected** | **Not Affected** | **Not Affected** | **Migrate to 8.2.x or later** | **Migrate to 8.2.x or later** | **8.2(5.48) or later** | **8.3(2.40) or later** | **8.4(7.15) or later** | **Not Affected** | **8.6(1.13) or later** | **8.7(1.11) or later** | **9.0(4.1) or later** | **9.1(4.5) or later** | **Not Affected** |         1Cisco ASA Software versions 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, and 8.1 reached End of Software Maintenance.

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 8.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.
