Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2038:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Linux kernel's NFS (Network File System) implementation. Specifically, when extending a write operation to cover an entire page, the kernel wasn't always ensuring the cached page was up-to-date before proceeding. This issue was introduced by commit `c7559663` and fixed by commit `263b4509`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Leak:** The primary weakness is that when a write operation is extended, the kernel might not have the most recent data in its page cache. This can lead to a situation where uninitialized data, potentially from kernel memory, is written to the file.
- **Data Corruption:** The description mentions this bug also acts as a data corruptor, although the specifics aren't detailed. It is likely that the stale cache data being written results in corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker with write access to an NFS share could potentially read sensitive data present in the kernel memory through this flaw.
- **Data Integrity:** The vulnerability can lead to data corruption due to stale cache being written.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local user must have write access to a file on an NFS share.
- The user must be able to trigger the code path that extends a write to cover a full page. This is related to the write delegation feature in NFS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **NFS Write Permissions:** The attacker needs to have write privileges to a file on an NFS share mounted on the vulnerable system.
- **Knowledge of NFS**: The attacker needs to know how to trigger the write extension through normal file access.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was introduced by commit `c7559663` and fixed by commit `263b4509`.
- The fix was backported to the 3.12.11 and 3.13.3 stable kernels.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 were not affected.
- This issue was fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2014:0328.
- An Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-2137-1) addressed the vulnerability in Ubuntu 12.04 and USN-2140-1 in Ubuntu 13.10.
