mmc: sdhci-pci: Fix BYT sd card getting stuck in runtime suspend
commit 77a0122e0838663795651aa0beb2325156f98c09 upstream.
A host controller for a SD card may need a GPIO for card detect in order
to wake up from runtime suspend when a card is inserted. If that GPIO is
not configured, then the host controller will not wake up. Fix that for
the affected devices by not enabling runtime PM unless the GPIO is
successfully set up.
This affects BYT sd card host controller which had runtime PM enabled from
v3.11. For completeness, the MFD sd card host controller is flagged also.
The original patch before rebasing (see link below) was tested on v3.11.10
and v3.12.4 although the patch applied with some offsets and fuzz. The
original patch is here:

rtc-cmos: Add an alarm disable quirk
commit d5a1c7e3fc38d9c7d629e1e47f32f863acbdec3d upstream.
41c7f7424259f ("rtc: Disable the alarm in the hardware (v2)") added the
functionality to disable the RTC wake alarm when shutting down the box.
However, there are at least two b0rked BIOSes we know about:
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=812592
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show\_bug.cgi?id=805740
where, when wakeup alarm is enabled in the BIOS, the machine reboots
automatically right after shutdown, regardless of what wakeup time is
programmed.
Bisecting the issue lead to this patch so disable its functionality with
a DMI quirk only for those boxes.

timekeeping: Fix missing timekeeping\_update in suspend path
commit 330a1617b0a6268d427aa5922c94d082b1d3e96d upstream.
Since 48cdc135d4840 (Implement a shadow timekeeper), we have to
call timekeeping\_update() after any adjustment to the timekeeping
structure in order to make sure that any adjustments to the structure
persist.
In the timekeeping suspend path, we udpate the timekeeper
structure, so we should be sure to update the shadow-timekeeper
before releasing the timekeeping locks. Currently this isn't done.
In most cases, the next time related code to run would be
timekeeping\_resume, which does update the shadow-timekeeper, but
in an abundence of caution, this patch adds the call to
timekeeping\_update() in the suspend path.

timekeeping: Fix CLOCK\_TAI timer/nanosleep delays
commit 04005f6011e3b504cd4d791d9769f7cb9a3b2eae upstream.
A think-o in the calculation of the monotonic -> tai time offset
results in CLOCK\_TAI timers and nanosleeps to expire late (the
latency is ~2x the tai offset).
Fix this by adding the tai offset from the realtime offset instead
of subtracting.

3.13.y: timekeeping: Fix clock\_set/clock\_was\_set think-o
In backporting 6fdda9a9c5db367130cf32df5d6618d08b89f46a
(timekeeping: Avoid possible deadlock from clock\_was\_set\_delayed),
I ralized the patch had a think-o where instead of checking
clock\_set I accidentally typed clock\_was\_set (which is a function
- so the conditional always is true).
Upstream this was resolved in the immediately following patch
47a1b796306356f358e515149d86baf0cc6bf007 (tick/timekeeping: Call
update\_wall\_time outside the jiffies lock). But since that patch
really isn't -stable material, so this patch only pulls
the name change.

timekeeping: Avoid possible deadlock from clock\_was\_set\_delayed
commit 6fdda9a9c5db367130cf32df5d6618d08b89f46a upstream.
As part of normal operaions, the hrtimer subsystem frequently calls
into the timekeeping code, creating a locking order of
hrtimer locks -> timekeeping locks
clock\_was\_set\_delayed() was suppoed to allow us to avoid deadlocks
between the timekeeping the hrtimer subsystem, so that we could
notify the hrtimer subsytem the time had changed while holding
the timekeeping locks. This was done by scheduling delayed work
that would run later once we were out of the timekeeing code.
But unfortunately the lock chains are complex enoguh that in
scheduling delayed work, we end up eventually trying to grab
an hrtimer lock.
Sasha Levin noticed this in testing when the new seqlock lockdep
enablement triggered the following (somewhat abrieviated) message:

[ 251.101967] Workqueue: events clock\_was\_set\_work
So the best solution is to avoid calling clock\_was\_set\_delayed() while
holding the timekeeping lock, and instead using a flag variable to
decide if we should call clock\_was\_set() once we've released the locks.
This works for the case here, where the do\_adjtimex() was the deadlock
trigger point. Unfortuantely, in update\_wall\_time() we still hold
the jiffies lock, which would deadlock with the ipi triggered by
clock\_was\_set(), preventing us from calling it even after we drop the
timekeeping lock. So instead call clock\_was\_set\_delayed() at that point.

timekeeping: Fix potential lost pv notification of time change
commit 5258d3f25c76f6ab86e9333abf97a55a877d3870 upstream.
In 780427f0e11 (Indicate that clock was set in the pvclock
gtod notifier), logic was added to pass a CLOCK\_WAS\_SET
notification to the pvclock notifier chain.
While that patch added a action flag returned from
accumulate\_nsecs\_to\_secs(), it only uses the returned value
in one location, and not in the logarithmic accumulation.
This means if a leap second triggered during the logarithmic
accumulation (which is most likely where it would happen),
the notification that the clock was set would not make it to
the pv notifiers.
This patch extends the logarithmic\_accumulation pass down
that action flag so proper notification will occur.
This patch also changes the varialbe action -> clock\_set
per Ingo's suggestion.

timekeeping: Fix lost updates to tai adjustment
commit f55c07607a38f84b5c7e6066ee1cfe433fa5643c upstream.
Since 48cdc135d4840 (Implement a shadow timekeeper), we have to
call timekeeping\_update() after any adjustment to the timekeeping
structure in order to make sure that any adjustments to the structure
persist.
Unfortunately, the updates to the tai offset via adjtimex do not
trigger this update, causing adjustments to the tai offset to be
made and then over-written by the previous value at the next
update\_wall\_time() call.
This patch resovles the issue by calling timekeeping\_update()
right after setting the tai offset.

ftrace: Have function graph only trace based on global\_ops filters
commit 23a8e8441a0a74dd612edf81dc89d1600bc0a3d1 upstream.
Doing some different tests, I discovered that function graph tracing, when
filtered via the set\_ftrace\_filter and set\_ftrace\_notrace files, does
not always keep with them if another function ftrace\_ops is registered
to trace functions.
The reason is that function graph just happens to trace all functions
that the function tracer enables. When there was only one user of
function tracing, the function graph tracer did not need to worry about
being called by functions that it did not want to trace. But now that there
are other users, this becomes a problem.
For example, one just needs to do the following:
# cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
# echo schedule > set\_ftrace\_filter
# echo function\_graph > current\_tracer
# cat trace
[..]

When the stack tracer was enabled, it enabled all functions to be traced, which
now the function graph tracer also traces. This is a side effect that should
not occur.
To fix this a test is added when the function tracing is changed, as well as when
the graph tracer is enabled, to see if anything other than the ftrace global\_ops
function tracer is enabled. If so, then the graph tracer calls a test trampoline
that will look at the function that is being traced and compare it with the
filters defined by the global\_ops.
As an optimization, if there's no other function tracers registered, or if
the only registered function tracers also use the global ops, the function
graph infrastructure will call the registered function graph callback directly
and not go through the test trampoline.

ftrace: Fix synchronization location disabling and freeing ftrace\_ops
commit a4c35ed241129dd142be4cadb1e5a474a56d5464 upstream.
The synchronization needed after ftrace\_ops are unregistered must happen
after the callback is disabled from becing called by functions.
The current location happens after the function is being removed from the
internal lists, but not after the function callbacks were disabled, leaving
the functions susceptible of being called after their callbacks are freed.
This affects perf and any externel users of function tracing (LTTng and
SystemTap).

ftrace: Synchronize setting function\_trace\_op with ftrace\_trace\_function
commit 405e1d834807e51b2ebd3dea81cb51e53fb61504 upstream.
ftrace\_trace\_function is a variable that holds what function will be called
directly by the assembly code (mcount). If just a single function is
registered and it handles recursion itself, then the assembly will call that
function directly without any helper function. It also passes in the
ftrace\_op that was registered with the callback. The ftrace\_op to send is
stored in the function\_trace\_op variable.
The ftrace\_trace\_function and function\_trace\_op needs to be coordinated such
that the called callback wont be called with the wrong ftrace\_op, otherwise
bad things can happen if it expected a different op. Luckily, there's no
callback that doesn't use the helper functions that requires this. But
there soon will be and this needs to be fixed.
Use a set\_function\_trace\_op to store the ftrace\_op to set the
function\_trace\_op to when it is safe to do so (during the update function
within the breakpoint or stop machine calls). Or if dynamic ftrace is not
being used (static tracing) then we have to do a bit more synchronization
when the ftrace\_trace\_function is set as that takes affect immediately
(as oppose to dynamic ftrace doing it with the modification of the trampoline).

drm/i915: Fix the offset issue for the stolen GEM objects
commit ec14ba47791965d2c08e0a681ff44eacbf3c4553 upstream.
The 'offset' field of the 'scatterlist' structure was wrongly
programmed with the offset value from the base of stolen area,
whereas this field indicates the offset from where the interested
data starts within the first PAGE pointed to by 'scattterlist'

drm/i915: Flush outstanding requests before allocating new seqno
commit 304d695c3dc8eb65206b9eaf16f8d1a41510d1cf upstream.
In very rare cases (such as a memory failure stress test) it is possible
to fill the entire ring without emitting a request. Under this
circumstance, the outstanding request is flushed and waited upon. After
space on the ring is cleared, we return to emitting the new command -
except that we just cleared the seqno allocated for this operation and
trigger the sanity check that a request is only ever emitted with a
valid seqno. The fix is to rearrange the code to make sure the
allocation of the seqno for this operation is after any required flushes
of outstanding operations.
The bug exists since the preallocation was introduced in

target: Fix percpu\_ref\_put race in transport\_lun\_remove\_cmd
commit 5259a06ef97068b710f45d092a587e8d740f750f upstream.
This patch fixes a percpu\_ref\_put race for se\_lun->lun\_ref in
transport\_lun\_remove\_cmd() where ->lun\_ref could end up being
put more than once per command via different target completion
and fabric release contexts.
It adds a cmpxchg() for se\_cmd->lun\_ref\_active to ensure that
percpu\_ref\_put() is only ever called once per se\_cmd.
This bug was manifesting itself as a LUN shutdown regression
bug in >= v3.13 code, where percpu\_ref\_kill() would end up
hanging indefinately due to the incorrect percpu\_ref count.
(Change se\_cmd->lun\_ref\_active from bool -> int to force at
least a 4-byte cmpxchg with MIPS ll/sc ins. - Fengguang)

dm sysfs: fix a module unload race
commit 2995fa78e423d7193f3b57835f6c1c75006a0315 upstream.
This reverts commit be35f48610 ("dm: wait until embedded kobject is
released before destroying a device") and provides an improved fix.
The kobject release code that calls the completion must be placed in a
non-module file, otherwise there is a module unload race (if the process
calling dm\_kobject\_release is preempted and the DM module unloaded after
the completion is triggered, but before dm\_kobject\_release returns).
To fix this race, this patch moves the completion code to dm-builtin.c
which is always compiled directly into the kernel if BLK\_DEV\_DM is
selected.
The patch introduces a new dm\_kobject\_holder structure, its purpose is
to keep the completion and kobject in one place, so that it can be
accessed from non-module code without the need to export the layout of
struct mapped\_device to that code.

dib8000: make 32 bits read atomic
commit 5ac64ba12aca3bef18e61c866583155a3bbf81c4 upstream.
As the dvb-frontend kthread can be called anytime, it can race
with some get status ioctl. So, it seems better to avoid one to
race with the other while reading a 32 bits register.
I can't see any other reason for having a mutex there at I2C, except
to provide such kind of protection, as the I2C core already has a
mutex to protect I2C transfers.
Note: instead of this approach, it could eventually remove the dib8000
specific mutex for it, and either group the 4 ops into one xfer or
to manually control the I2C mutex. The main advantage of the current
approach is that the changes are smaller and more puntual.

commit 6c3df5da67f1f53df78c7e20cd53a481dc28eade upstream.
The side effect of commit 1056e4388b045 ("v4l2-dev: Fix race condition on

on video\_device registration. Before that commit video\_devices were
numbered from 0, after it, the indexes starts from 1, because get\_index()
always count the device, which is being registered. Some device drivers
rely on video\_device index number for internal purposes, i.e. s5p-mfc
driver stopped working after that patch. This patch restores the old method
of numbering the video\_device indexes.

mm, oom: base root bonus on current usage
commit 778c14affaf94a9e4953179d3e13a544ccce7707 upstream.
A 3% of system memory bonus is sometimes too excessive in comparison to
other processes.
With commit a63d83f427fb ("oom: badness heuristic rewrite"), the OOM
killer tries to avoid killing privileged tasks by subtracting 3% of
overall memory (system or cgroup) from their per-task consumption. But
as a result, all root tasks that consume less than 3% of overall memory
are considered equal, and so it only takes 33+ privileged tasks pushing
the system out of memory for the OOM killer to do something stupid and
kill dhclient or other root-owned processes. For example, on a 32G
machine it can't tell the difference between the 1M agetty and the 10G
fork bomb member.
The changelog describes this 3% boost as the equivalent to the global
overcommit limit being 3% higher for privileged tasks, but this is not
the same as discounting 3% of overall memory from \_every privileged task
individually\_ during OOM selection.
Replace the 3% of system memory bonus with a 3% of current memory usage
bonus.
By giving root tasks a bonus that is proportional to their actual size,
they remain comparable even when relatively small. In the example
above, the OOM killer will discount the 1M agetty's 256 badness points
down to 179, and the 10G fork bomb's 262144 points down to 183500 points
and make the right choice, instead of discounting both to 0 and killing
agetty because it's first in the task list.

numa: add a sysctl for numa\_balancing
commit 54a43d54988a3731d644fdeb7a1d6f46b4ac64c7 upstream.
Add a working sysctl to enable/disable automatic numa memory balancing
at runtime.
This allows us to track down performance problems with this feature and
is generally a good idea.
This was possible earlier through debugfs, but only with special
debugging options set. Also fix the boot message.

iscsi-target: Fix connection reset hang with percpu\_ida\_alloc
commit 555b270e25b0279b98083518a85f4b1da144a181 upstream.
This patch addresses a bug where connection reset would hang
indefinately once percpu\_ida\_alloc() was starved for tags, due
to the fact that it always assumed uninterruptible sleep mode.
So now make percpu\_ida\_alloc() check for signal\_pending\_state() for
making interruptible sleep optional, and convert iscsit\_allocate\_cmd()
to set TASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE for GFP\_KERNEL, or TASK\_RUNNING for
GFP\_ATOMIC.

percpu\_ida: Make percpu\_ida\_alloc + callers accept task state bitmask
commit 6f6b5d1ec56acdeab0503d2b823f6f88a0af493e upstream.
This patch changes percpu\_ida\_alloc() + callers to accept task state
bitmask for prepare\_to\_wait() for code like target/iscsi that needs
it for interruptible sleep, that is provided in a subsequent patch.
It now expects TASK\_UNINTERRUPTIBLE when the caller is able to sleep
waiting for a new tag, or TASK\_RUNNING when the caller cannot sleep,
and is forced to return a negative value when no tags are available.
v2 changes:
- Include blk-mq + tcm\_fc + vhost/scsi + target/iscsi changes
- Drop signal\_pending\_state() call
v3 changes:
- Only call prepare\_to\_wait() + finish\_wait() when != TASK\_RUNNING

dm space map metadata: fix bug in resizing of thin metadata
commit fca028438fb903852beaf7c3fe1cd326651af57d upstream.
This bug was introduced in commit 7e664b3dec431e ("dm space map metadata:
fix extending the space map").
When extending a dm-thin metadata volume we:
- Switch the space map into a simple bootstrap mode, which allocates
all space linearly from the newly added space.
- Add new bitmap entries for the new space
- Increment the reference counts for those newly allocated bitmap
entries
- Commit changes to disk
- Switch back out of bootstrap mode.
But, the disk commit may allocate space itself, if so this fact will be
lost when switching out of bootstrap mode.
The bug exhibited itself as an error when the bitmap\_root, with an
erroneous ref count of 0, was subsequently decremented as part of a
later disk commit. This would cause the disk commit to fail, and thinp
to enter read\_only mode. The metadata was not damaged (thin\_check
passed).
The fix is to put the increments + commit into a loop, running until
the commit has not allocated extra space. In practise this loop only
runs twice.
With this fix the following device mapper testsuite test passes:
dmtest run --suite thin-provisioning -n thin\_remove\_works\_after\_resize

dm space map metadata: fix extending the space map
commit 7e664b3dec431eebf0c5df5ff704d6197634cf35 upstream.
When extending a metadata space map we should do the first commit whilst
still in bootstrap mode -- a mode where all blocks get allocated in the
new area.
That way the commit overhead is allocated from the newly added space.
Otherwise we risk running out of space.

new space is used during extend", the following device mapper testsuite

commit 12c91a5c2d2a8e8cc40a9552313e1e7b0a2d9ee3 upstream.
When extending a low level space map we should update nr\_blocks at

Otherwise extend can fail, e.g.: sm\_metadata\_extend call sequence
that fails:

dm: wait until embedded kobject is released before destroying a device
commit be35f486108227e10fe5d96fd42fb2b344c59983 upstream.
There may be other parts of the kernel holding a reference on the dm
kobject. We must wait until all references are dropped before
deallocating the mapped\_device structure.
The dm\_kobject\_release method signals that all references are dropped
via completion. But dm\_kobject\_release doesn't free the kobject (which
is embedded in the mapped\_device structure).
This is the sequence of operations:
\* when destroying a DM device, call kobject\_put from dm\_sysfs\_exit
\* wait until all users stop using the kobject, when it happens the
release method is called
\* the release method signals the completion and should return without
delay
\* the dm device removal code that waits on the completion continues
\* the dm device removal code drops the dm\_mod reference the device had
\* the dm device removal code frees the mapped\_device structure that
contains the kobject
Using kobject this way should avoid the module unload race that was
mentioned at the beginning of this thread:

dm thin: fix set\_pool\_mode exposed pool operation races
commit 8b64e881eb40ac8b9bfcbce068a97eef819044ee upstream.
The pool mode must not be switched until after the corresponding pool
process\_\* methods have been established. Otherwise, because
set\_pool\_mode() isn't interlocked with the IO path for performance
reasons, the IO path can end up executing process\_\* operations that
don't match the mode. This patch eliminates problems like the following
(as seen on really fast PCIe SSD storage when transitioning the pool's
mode from PM\_READ\_ONLY to PM\_WRITE):

dm thin: fix discard support to a previously shared block
commit 19fa1a6756ed9e92daa9537c03b47d6b55cc2316 upstream.
If a snapshot is created and later deleted the origin dm\_thin\_device's
snapshotted\_time will have been updated to reflect the snapshot's
creation time. The 'shared' flag in the dm\_thin\_lookup\_result struct
returned from dm\_thin\_find\_block() is an approximation based on
snapshotted\_time -- this is done to avoid 0(n), or worse, time
complexity. In this case, the shared flag would be true.
But because the 'shared' flag reflects an approximation a block can be
incorrectly assumed to be shared (e.g. false positive for 'shared'
because the snapshot no longer exists). This could result in discards
issued to a thin device not being passed down to the pool's underlying
data device.
To fix this we double check that a thin block is really still in-use
after a mapping is removed using dm\_pool\_block\_is\_used(). If the
reference count for a block is now zero the discard is allowed to be
passed down.
Also add a 'definitely\_not\_shared' member to the dm\_thin\_new\_mapping
structure -- reflects that the 'shared' flag in the response from
dm\_thin\_find\_block() can only be held as definitive if false is
returned.

sunrpc: don't wait for write before allowing reads from use-gss-proxy file
commit 1654a04cd702fd19c297c36300a6ab834cf8c072 upstream.
It doesn't make much sense to make reads from this procfile hang. As
far as I can tell, only gssproxy itself will open this file and it
never reads from it. Change it to just give the present setting of
sn->use\_gss\_proxy without waiting for anything.
Note that we do not want to call use\_gss\_proxy() in this codepath
since an inopportune read of this file could cause it to be disabled
prematurely.

sunrpc: Fix infinite loop in RPC state machine
commit 6ff33b7dd0228b7d7ed44791bbbc98b03fd15d9d upstream.
When a task enters call\_refreshresult with status 0 from call\_refresh and
!rpcauth\_uptodatecred(task) it enters call\_refresh again with no rate-limiting
or max number of retries.
Instead of trying forever, make use of the retry path that other errors use.
This only seems to be possible when the crrefresh callback is gss\_refresh\_null,
which only happens when destroying the context.
To reproduce:
1) mount with sec=krb5 (or sec=sys with krb5 negotiated for non FSID specific
operations).
2) reboot - the client will be stuck and will need to be hard rebooted

The check for whether or not we sent an RPC call in nfs40\_sequence\_done

pnfs: Proper delay for NFS4ERR\_RECALLCONFLICT in layout\_get\_done
commit ed7e5423014ad89720fcf315c0b73f2c5d0c7bd2 upstream.
An NFS4ERR\_RECALLCONFLICT is returned by server from a GET\_LAYOUT
only when a Server Sent a RECALL do to that GET\_LAYOUT, or
the RECALL and GET\_LAYOUT crossed on the wire.
In any way this means we want to wait at most until in-flight IO
is finished and the RECALL can be satisfied.
So a proper wait here is more like 1/10 of a second, not 15 seconds
like we have now. In case of a server bug we delay exponentially
longer on each retry.
Current code totally craps out performance of very large files on

NFSv4.1: Handle errors correctly in nfs41\_walk\_client\_list
commit 64590daa9e0dfb3aad89e3ab9230683b76211d5b upstream.
Both nfs41\_walk\_client\_list and nfs40\_walk\_client\_list expect the
'status' variable to be set to the value -NFS4ERR\_STALE\_CLIENTID
if the loop fails to find a match.
The problem is that the 'pos->cl\_cons\_state > NFS\_CS\_READY' changes
the value of 'status', and sets it either to the value '0' (which
indicates success), or to the value EINTR.

nfs: always make sure page is up-to-date before extending a write to cover the entire page
commit 263b4509ec4d47e0da3e753f85a39ea12d1eff24 upstream.
We should always make sure the cached page is up-to-date when we're
determining whether we can extend a write to cover the full page -- even
if we've received a write delegation from the server.
Commit c7559663 added logic to skip this check if we have a write
delegation, which can lead to data corruption such as the following
scenario if client B receives a write delegation from the NFS server:
Client A:
# echo 123456789 > /mnt/file
Client B:
# echo abcdefghi >> /mnt/file
# cat /mnt/file
0�D0�abcdefghi
Just because we hold a write delegation doesn't mean that we've read in
the entire page contents.

spidev: fix hang when transfer\_one\_message fails
commit e120cc0dcf2880a4c5c0a6cb27b655600a1cfa1d upstream.
This corrects a problem in spi\_pump\_messages() that leads to an spi
message hanging forever when a call to transfer\_one\_message() fails.
This failure occurs in my MCP2210 driver when the cs\_change bit is set
on the last transfer in a message, an operation which the hardware does
not support.
Rationale
Since the transfer\_one\_message() returns an int, we must presume that it
may fail. If transfer\_one\_message() should never fail, it should return
void. Thus, calls to transfer\_one\_message() should properly manage a
failure.

ore: Fix wrong math in allocation of per device BIO
commit aad560b7f63b495f48a7232fd086c5913a676e6f upstream.
At IO preparation we calculate the max pages at each device and
allocate a BIO per device of that size. The calculation was wrong
on some unaligned corner cases offset/length combination and would
make prepare return with -ENOMEM. This would be bad for pnfs-objects
that would in that case IO through MDS. And fatal for exofs were it
would fail writes with EIO.
Fix it by doing the proper math, that will work in all cases. (I
ran a test with all possible offset/length combinations this time
round).
Also when reading we do not need to allocate for the parity units
since we jump over them.
Also lower the max\_io\_length to take into account the parity pages
so not to allocate BIOs bigger than PAGE\_SIZE

tile: remove compat\_sys\_lookup\_dcookie declaration to fix compile error
commit 5a5e75f4714a592f31e57f248b8f5c866f278b8d upstream.
With commit d8d14bd09cdd ("fs/compat: fix lookup\_dcookie() parameter

lookup\_dcookie() syscall.
However I missed that there was still a stale declaration in
arch/tile/.. which now causes a compile error on tile:
In file included from fs/dcookies.c:28:0:
include/linux/compat.h:425:17: error: conflicting types for 'compat\_sys\_lookup\_dcookie'
fs/dcookies.c:207:1: error: conflicting types for 'compat\_sys\_lookup\_dcookie'
Simply remove the declaration in the tile architecture, which is only a
leftover from before the different compat lookup\_dcookie() versions have
been merged. The correct declaration is now in include/linux/compat.h
The build error was reported by Fenguang's build bot.

We got a report that the pwritev syscall does not work correctly in

It turned out that with commit 72ec35163f9f ("switch compat readv/writev

couple of syscall parameters because the some parameter types haven't
been converted from unsigned long to compat\_ulong\_t.
This is needed for architectures where the ABI requires that the caller

ACPI / init: Flag use of ACPI and ACPI idioms for power supplies to regulator API
commit 49a12877d2777cadcb838981c3c4f5a424aef310 upstream.
There is currently no facility in ACPI to express the hookup of voltage
regulators, the expectation is that the regulators that exist in the
system will be handled transparently by firmware if they need software
control at all. This means that if for some reason the regulator API is
enabled on such a system it should assume that any supplies that devices
need are provided by the system at all relevant times without any software
intervention.
Tell the regulator core to make this assumption by calling
regulator\_has\_full\_constraints(). Do this as soon as we know we are using
ACPI so that the information is available to the regulator core as early
as possible. This will cause the regulator core to pretend that there is
an always on regulator supplying any supply that is requested but that has
not otherwise been mapped which is the behaviour expected on a system with
ACPI.
Should the ability to specify regulators be added in future revisions of
ACPI then once we have support for ACPI mappings in the kernel the same
assumptions will apply. It is also likely that systems will default to a
mode of operation which does not require any interpretation of these
mappings in order to be compatible with existing operating system releases
so it should remain safe to make these assumptions even if the mappings
exist but are not supported by the kernel.

turbostat uses inline assembly to call cpuid. On 32-bit x86, on systems
that have certain security features enabled by default that make -fPIC
the default, this causes a build error:
turbostat.c: In function ‘check\_cpuid’:

^
GCC provides a header cpuid.h, containing a \_\_get\_cpuid function that
works with both PIC and non-PIC. (On PIC, it saves and restores ebx
around the cpuid instruction.) Use that instead.

turbostat: Don't put unprocessed uapi headers in the include path
commit b731f3119de57144e16c19fd593b8daeb637843e upstream.
turbostat's Makefile puts arch/x86/include/uapi/ in the include path, so
that it can include  from it. It isn't in general safe to
include even uapi headers directly from the kernel tree without
processing them through scripts/headers\_install.sh, but asm/msr.h
happens to work.
However, that include path can break with some versions of system
headers, by overriding some system headers with the unprocessed versions
directly from the kernel source. For instance:
In file included from /build/x86-generic/usr/include/bits/sigcontext.h:28:0,
from /build/x86-generic/usr/include/signal.h:339,
from /build/x86-generic/usr/include/sys/wait.h:31,
from turbostat.c:27:
../../../../arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/sigcontext.h:4:28: fatal error: linux/compiler.h: No such file or directory
This occurs because the system bits/sigcontext.h on that build system
includes , and asm/sigcontext.h in the kernel source
includes , which scripts/headers\_install.sh would have
filtered out.
Since turbostat really only wants a single header, just include that one
header rather than putting an entire directory of kernel headers on the
include path.
In the process, switch from msr.h to msr-index.h, since turbostat just
wants the MSR numbers.

/sys/kernel/slab/:t-0000048 # cat slabs
145 N0=36 N1=109
See, the number of slabs is smaller than that of cpu slabs.
The bug was introduced by commit 49e2258586b423684f03c278149ab46d8f8b6700
("slub: per cpu cache for partial pages").
We should use page->pages instead of page->pobjects when calculating
the number of cpu partial slabs. This also fixes the mapping of slabs
and nodes.
As there's no variable storing the number of total/active objects in
cpu partial slabs, and we don't have user interfaces requiring those
statistics, I just add WARN\_ON for those cases.

ARM: orion: provide C-style interrupt handler for MULTI\_IRQ\_HANDLER
commit f28d7de6bd4d41774744e011141945affa127da4 upstream.
DT-enabled Marvell Kirkwood and Dove SoCs make use of an irqchip
driver. As expected for irqchip drivers, it uses a C-style
interrupt handler and therefore selects MULTI\_IRQ\_HANDLER.
Now, compiling a kernel with both non-DT and DT support enabled,
selecting MULTI\_IRQ\_HANDLER will break ASM irq handler used by
non-DT boards.
Therefore, we provide a C-style irq handler even for non-DT boards,
if MULTI\_IRQ\_HANDLER is set. By installing the C-style irq handler
in orion\_irq\_init this is transparent to all non-DT board files.
While the regression report was filed on Marvell Kirkwood, also
Marvell Dove non-DT boards are affected and fixed by this patch.

mmc: atmel-mci: fix timeout errors in SDIO mode when using DMA
commit 66b512eda74d59b17eac04c4da1b38d82059e6c9 upstream.
With some SDIO devices, timeout errors can happen when reading data.
To solve this issue, the DMA transfer has to be activated before sending
the command to the device. This order is incorrect in PDC mode. So we
have to take care if we are using DMA or PDC to know when to send the
MMC command.

mmc: fix host release issue after discard operation
commit f662ae48ae67dfd42739e65750274fe8de46240a upstream.
Under function mmc\_blk\_issue\_rq, after an MMC discard operation,
the MMC request data structure may be freed in memory. Later in
the same function, the check of req->cmd\_flags & MMC\_REQ\_SPECIAL\_MASK
is dangerous and invalid. It causes the MMC host not to be released
when it should.
This patch fixes the issue by marking the special request down before
the discard/flush operation.

mm: don't lose the SOFT\_DIRTY flag on mprotect
commit 24f91eba18bbfdb27e71a1aae5b3a61b67fcd091 upstream.
The SOFT\_DIRTY bit shows that the content of memory was changed after a
defined point in the past. mprotect() doesn't change the content of
memory, so it must not change the SOFT\_DIRTY bit.
This bug causes a malfunction: on the first iteration all pages are
dumped. On other iterations only pages with the SOFT\_DIRTY bit are
dumped. So if the SOFT\_DIRTY bit is cleared from a page by mistake, the
page is not dumped and its content will be restored incorrectly.
This patch does nothing with \_PAGE\_SWP\_SOFT\_DIRTY, becase pte\_modify()
is called only for present pages.
Fixes commit 0f8975ec4db2 ("mm: soft-dirty bits for user memory changes

mm: ignore VM\_SOFTDIRTY on VMA merging
commit 34228d473efe764d4db7c0536375f0c993e6e06a upstream.
The VM\_SOFTDIRTY bit affects vma merge routine: if two VMAs has all bits
in vm\_flags matched except dirty bit the kernel can't longer merge them
and this forces the kernel to generate new VMAs instead.
It finally may lead to the situation when userspace application reaches
vm.max\_map\_count limit and get crashed in worse case
| (gimp:11768): GLib-ERROR \*\*: gmem.c:110: failed to allocate 4096 bytes

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=719619#c0
Initial problem came from missed VM\_SOFTDIRTY in do\_brk() routine but
even if we would set up VM\_SOFTDIRTY here, there is still a way to
prevent VMAs from merging: one can call
| echo 4 > /proc/$PID/clear\_refs
and clear all VM\_SOFTDIRTY over all VMAs presented in memory map, then
new do\_brk() will try to extend old VMA and finds that dirty bit doesn't
match thus new VMA will be generated.
As discussed with Pavel, the right approach should be to ignore
VM\_SOFTDIRTY bit when we're trying to merge VMAs and if merge successed
we mark extended VMA with dirty bit where needed.

memcg: fix css reference leak and endless loop in mem\_cgroup\_iter
commit 0eef615665ede1e0d603ea9ecca88c1da6f02234 upstream.
Commit 19f39402864e ("memcg: simplify mem\_cgroup\_iter") has reorganized
mem\_cgroup\_iter code in order to simplify it. A part of that change was
dropping an optimization which didn't call css\_tryget on the root of the
walked tree. The patch however didn't change the css\_put part in
mem\_cgroup\_iter which excludes root.
This wasn't an issue at the time because \_\_mem\_cgroup\_iter\_next bailed
out for root early without taking a reference as cgroup iterators
(css\_next\_descendant\_pre) didn't visit root themselves.
Nevertheless cgroup iterators have been reworked to visit root by commit
bd8815a6d802 ("cgroup: make css\_for\_each\_descendant() and friends
include the origin css in the iteration") when the root bypass have been
dropped in \_\_mem\_cgroup\_iter\_next. This means that css\_put is not
called for root and so css along with mem\_cgroup and other cgroup
internal object tied by css lifetime are never freed.
Fix the issue by reintroducing root check in \_\_mem\_cgroup\_iter\_next and
do not take css reference for it.
This reference counting magic protects us also from another issue, an
endless loop reported by Hugh Dickins when reclaim races with root
removal and css\_tryget called by iterator internally would fail. There
would be no other nodes to visit so \_\_mem\_cgroup\_iter\_next would return
NULL and mem\_cgroup\_iter would interpret it as "start looping from root
again" and so mem\_cgroup\_iter would loop forever internally.

memcg: fix endless loop caused by mem\_cgroup\_iter
commit ecc736fc3c71c411a9d201d8588c9e7e049e5d8c upstream.
Hugh has reported an endless loop when the hardlimit reclaim sees the
same group all the time. This might happen when the reclaim races with
the memcg removal.
shrink\_zone
[rmdir root]
mem\_cgroup\_iter(root, NULL, reclaim)
// prev = NULL
rcu\_read\_lock()
mem\_cgroup\_iter\_load
last\_visited = iter->last\_visited // gets root || NULL
css\_tryget(last\_visited) // failed
last\_visited = NULL [1]
memcg = root = \_\_mem\_cgroup\_iter\_next(root, NULL)

iter->last\_visited = root;

// prev = root
rcu\_read\_lock
mem\_cgroup\_iter\_load
last\_visited = iter->last\_visited // gets root
css\_tryget(last\_visited) // failed
[1]
The issue seemed to be introduced by commit 5f5781619718 ("memcg: relax
memcg iter caching") which has replaced unconditional css\_get/css\_put by
css\_tryget/css\_put for the cached iterator.
This patch fixes the issue by skipping css\_tryget on the root of the
tree walk in mem\_cgroup\_iter\_load and symmetrically doesn't release it
in mem\_cgroup\_iter\_update.

mm/page-writeback.c: do not count anon pages as dirtyable memory
commit a1c3bfb2f67ef766de03f1f56bdfff9c8595ab14 upstream.
The VM is currently heavily tuned to avoid swapping. Whether that is
good or bad is a separate discussion, but as long as the VM won't swap
to make room for dirty cache, we can not consider anonymous pages when
calculating the amount of dirtyable memory, the baseline to which
dirty\_background\_ratio and dirty\_ratio are applied.
A simple workload that occupies a significant size (40+%, depending on
memory layout, storage speeds etc.) of memory with anon/tmpfs pages and
uses the remainder for a streaming writer demonstrates this problem. In
that case, the actual cache pages are a small fraction of what is
considered dirtyable overall, which results in an relatively large
portion of the cache pages to be dirtied. As kswapd starts rotating
these, random tasks enter direct reclaim and stall on IO.
Only consider free pages and file pages dirtyable.

mm/page-writeback.c: fix dirty\_balance\_reserve subtraction from dirtyable memory
commit a804552b9a15c931cfc2a92a2e0aed1add8b580a upstream.
Tejun reported stuttering and latency spikes on a system where random
tasks would enter direct reclaim and get stuck on dirty pages. Around
50% of memory was occupied by tmpfs backed by an SSD, and another disk
(rotating) was reading and writing at max speed to shrink a partition.
: The problem was pretty ridiculous. It's a 8gig machine w/ one ssd and 10k
: rpm harddrive and I could reliably reproduce constant stuttering every
: several seconds for as long as buffered IO was going on on the hard drive
: either with tmpfs occupying somewhere above 4gig or a test program which
: allocates about the same amount of anon memory. Although swap usage was
: zero, turning off swap also made the problem go away too.
:
: The trigger conditions seem quite plausible - high anon memory usage w/
: heavy buffered IO and swap configured - and it's highly likely that this
: is happening in the wild too. (this can happen with copying large files
: to usb sticks too, right?)
This patch (of 2):
The dirty\_balance\_reserve is an approximation of the fraction of free
pages that the page allocator does not make available for page cache
allocations. As a result, it has to be taken into account when
calculating the amount of "dirtyable memory", the baseline to which
dirty\_background\_ratio and dirty\_ratio are applied.
However, currently the reserve is subtracted from the sum of free and
reclaimable pages, which is non-sensical and leads to erroneous results
when the system is dominated by unreclaimable pages and the
dirty\_balance\_reserve is bigger than free+reclaimable. In that case, at
least the already allocated cache should be considered dirtyable.
Fix the calculation by subtracting the reserve from the amount of free
pages, then adding the reclaimable pages on top.

mm/memcg: iteration skip memcgs not yet fully initialized

It is surprising that the mem\_cgroup iterator can return memcgs which

this appears not to present an actual problem; but it may be better to
prevent such surprises, by skipping memcgs not yet online.

mm/memory-failure.c: shift page lock from head page to tail page after thp split
commit 54b9dd14d09f24927285359a227aa363ce46089e upstream.
After thp split in hwpoison\_user\_mappings(), we hold page lock on the
raw error page only between try\_to\_unmap, hence we are in danger of race
condition.
I found in the RHEL7 MCE-relay testing that we have "bad page" error
when a memory error happens on a thp tail page used by qemu-kvm:

The reason of this bug is that a page fault happens before unlocking the
head page at the end of memory\_failure(). This strange page fault is
trying to access to address 0x20 and I'm not sure why qemu-kvm does
this, but anyway as a result the SIGSEGV makes qemu-kvm exit and on the
way we catch the bad page bug/warning because we try to free a locked
page (which was the former head page.)
To fix this, this patch suggests to shift page lock from head page to
tail page just after thp split. SIGSEGV still happens, but it affects
only error affected VMs, not a whole system.

xen\_platform\_pci=0
(in the guest config file)
or
xen\_emul\_unplug=never

except it does not work properly. The PV drivers still try to
load and since the Xen platform driver is not run - and it
has not initialized the grant tables, most of the PV drivers
stumble upon:

which is hardly nice. This patch fixes this by having each
PV driver check for:
- if running in PV, then it is fine to execute (as that is their
native environment).
- if running in HVM, check if user wanted 'xen\_emul\_unplug=never',
in which case bail out and don't load any PV drivers.
- if running in HVM, and if PCI device 5853:0001 (xen\_platform\_pci)
does not exist, then bail out and not load PV drivers.
- (v2) if running in HVM, and if the user wanted 'xen\_emul\_unplug=ide-disks',
then bail out for all PV devices \_except\_ the block one.
Ditto for the network one ('nics').
- (v2) if running in HVM, and if the user wanted 'xen\_emul\_unplug=unnecessary'
then load block PV driver, and also setup the legacy IDE paths.
In (v3) make it actually load PV drivers.

audit\_syscall\_exit() saves a result of regs\_return\_value() in intermediate
"int" variable and passes it to \_\_audit\_syscall\_exit(), which expects its
second argument as a "long" value. This will result in truncating the
value returned by a system call and making a wrong audit record.
I don't know why gcc compiler doesn't complain about this, but anyway it
causes a problem at runtime on arm64 (and probably most 64-bit archs).

In the eisa\_probe() force\_probe path, if we were unable to request slot
resources (e.g., [io 0x800-0x8ff]), we skipped the slot with "Cannot
allocate resource for EISA slot %d" before reading the EISA signature in

Commit 26abfeed4341 moved eisa\_init\_device() earlier, so we tried to read
the EISA signature before requesting the slot resources, and this caused
hangs during boot.

dma\_pte\_free\_level() has an off-by-one error when checking whether a pte
is completely covered by a range. Take for example the case of
attempting to free pfn 0x0 - 0x1ff, ie. 512 entries covering the first
2M superpage.
The level\_size() is 0x200 and we test:
static void dma\_pte\_free\_level(...
...
if (!(0 > 0 || 0x1ff < 0 + 0x200)) {
...
}
Clearly the 2nd test is true, which means we fail to take the branch to
clear and free the pagetable entry. As a result, we're leaking
pagetables and failing to install new pages over the range.
This was found with a PCI device assigned to a QEMU guest using vfio-pci
without a VGA device present. The first 1M of guest address space is
mapped with various combinations of 4K pages, but eventually the range
is entirely freed and replaced with a 2M contiguous mapping.
intel-iommu errors out with something like:
ERROR: DMA PTE for vPFN 0x0 already set (to 5c2b8003 not 849c00083)
In this case 5c2b8003 is the pointer to the previous leaf page that was
neither freed nor cleared and 849c00083 is the superpage entry that
we're trying to replace it with.

tracing: Check if tracing is enabled in trace\_puts()
commit 3132e107d608f8753240d82d61303c500fd515b4 upstream.
If trace\_puts() is used very early in boot up, it can crash the machine
if it is called before the ring buffer is allocated. If a trace\_printk()
is used with no arguments, then it will be converted into a trace\_puts()
and suffer the same fate.

tracing: Have trace buffer point back to trace\_array
commit dced341b2d4f06668efaab33f88de5d287c0f45b upstream.
The trace buffer has a descriptor pointer that goes back to the trace
array. But it was never assigned. Luckily, nothing uses it (yet), but
it will in the future.
Although nothing currently uses this, if any of the new features get
backported to older kernels, and because this is such a simple change,
I'm marking it for stable too.

# USN-2137-1: Linux kernel (Saucy HWE) vulnerabilities

7 March 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [linux-lts-saucy](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-saucy) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Saucy

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when built with the

NetFilter Connection Tracking (NF\_CONNTRACK) support for IRC protocol

(NF\_NAT\_IRC). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain

potentially sensitive kernel information when communicating over a client-

to-client IRC connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network. ([CVE-2014-1690](/security/CVE-2014-1690))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's NFS filesystem. A

local users with write access to an NFS share could exploit this flaw to

obtain potential sensative information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-2038](/security/CVE-2014-2038))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [linux-image-3.11.0-18-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-18.32~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-18.32~precise1)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-18-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy)
  -
  [3.11.0-18.32~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-lts-saucy/3.11.0-18.32~precise1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

…cover the entire page

We should always make sure the cached page is up-to-date when we're
determining whether we can extend a write to cover the full page -- even
if we've received a write delegation from the server.

Commit [c755966](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c7559663e42f4294ffe31fe159da6b6a66b35d61) added logic to skip this check if we have a write
delegation, which can lead to data corruption such as the following
scenario if client B receives a write delegation from the NFS server:

Client A:
    # echo 123456789 > /mnt/file

Client B:
    # echo abcdefghi >> /mnt/file
    # cat /mnt/file
    0�D0�abcdefghi

Just because we hold a write delegation doesn't mean that we've read in
the entire page contents.

# USN-2140-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

7 March 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when built with the

NetFilter Connection Tracking (NF\_CONNTRACK) support for IRC protocol

(NF\_NAT\_IRC). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain

potentially sensitive kernel information when communicating over a client-

to-client IRC connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network. ([CVE-2014-1690](/security/CVE-2014-1690))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux

kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP\_MAC\_ADMIN

capability (and the SELinux mac\_admin permission if running in enforcing

mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash).

([CVE-2014-1874](/security/CVE-2014-1874))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel's NFS filesystem. A

local users with write access to an NFS share could exploit this flaw to

obtain potential sensative information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-2038](/security/CVE-2014-2038))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [linux-image-3.11.0-18-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-18.32](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-18.32)
* [linux-image-3.11.0-18-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux)
  -
  [3.11.0-18.32](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/3.11.0-18.32)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1066939#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-02-19 10:59:36 UTC  ``` It was found that cached page was not up-to-date in certain cases when we were extending write to cover the full page and thus contained uninitalized data.  A local user with write access to file on nfs share could use this flaw to leak kernel memory.
