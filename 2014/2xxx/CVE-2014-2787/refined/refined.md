    "content": "The provided document from Microsoft's security bulletin MS14-037 includes information about CVE-2014-2787.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper memory access can lead to memory corruption.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n\n*   A memory corruption vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer when it improperly accesses objects in memory.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n\n*   Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.\n*   If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. This can lead to the ability to install programs, view/modify/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n\n*   The primary attack vector is through a web-based scenario where an attacker hosts a specially crafted webpage and convinces a user to view it using Internet Explorer. This could involve the attacker sending a link in an email or IM message or compromising legitimate websites.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n\n*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or compromise an existing website to host the malicious content.\n*   The attacker must then convince the user to navigate to the malicious page using Internet Explorer.\n\n**Additional details from the content:**\n\n*   The vulnerability is rated as 'Critical' on Windows client systems and 'Moderate' on Windows server systems for the affected versions of Internet Explorer.\n*   The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.\n*   The vulnerability is not known to have been exploited in the wild at the time the bulletin was released.\n*   Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can mitigate attacks attempting to exploit this vulnerability.\n",
