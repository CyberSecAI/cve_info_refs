Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the improper privilege assignment within the Cisco ASA software when accessed through Cisco ASDM. Specifically, users with privilege level 0 are not handled correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Privilege Assignment:** The core issue is that the system allows users with the lowest privilege level (0) to elevate their privileges, gaining administrative access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with a low-privilege (level 0) account can elevate their privileges to administrative level.
- **Administrative Access:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain full administrative control over the affected Cisco ASA device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely, requiring network connectivity to the targeted device.
- **Cisco ASDM Interface:** The attack is performed through the Cisco ASDM interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid user credentials with privilege level 0 to initiate the privilege escalation.
- **TCP Three-Way Handshake:** A TCP three-way handshake is needed to exploit this vulnerability, indicating it is a network-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the target Cisco ASA device.
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must possess valid user credentials for an account with privilege level 0 on the affected Cisco ASA device.
- **Knowledge of Cisco ASDM:** The attacker needs to be familiar with how to interact with the Cisco ASDM interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA software configured in routed or transparent firewall mode and in single or multiple context mode.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
- This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuj33496.
- The provided CVSS vector `AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C` confirms the network attack vector, moderate attack complexity, single authentication required and complete impact to Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.  Exploit code exists and an official fix is available. Report confidence is confirmed.
- A workaround is available by assigning privilege level 1 instead of 0 to users.
- The document also lists the fixed software versions for various ASA releases.
