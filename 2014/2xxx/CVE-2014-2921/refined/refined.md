Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-2921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an `unserialize` problem in Pimcore CMS. This suggests that the application is vulnerable to PHP object injection through the `unserialize` function, which, if provided with malicious user input, can be exploited to execute arbitrary PHP code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe use of `unserialize`**: The core vulnerability lies in the usage of `unserialize()` on data that is potentially under the attacker's control, particularly in the context of `Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the vulnerable `unserialize` function within the `Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy` component of the Pimcore CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious data that is then passed to the vulnerable `unserialize` call via the `Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy`.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable part of the application.

**Additional details provided by the content:**

- This CVE is specifically associated with the exploit path via `Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy` and affects Pimcore CMS versions 1.4.9 to 2.0.0 inclusive.
- There exists another closely related vulnerability (CVE-2014-2922) which is exploited via `Zend_Http_Response_Stream` that affects versions 1.4.9 to 2.1.0 inclusive.
- The impact of the two vulnerabilities are different.
- The existence of version-enforcement code (introduced in 2.0.1) and differences in the PHP versions affect the exploitation of the `Zend_Http_Response_Stream` vulnerability, but do not affect the identification of two separate CVEs.
- The differentiation between the two CVEs is based on the specific vulnerable component used and the affected version ranges, despite both stemming from an `unserialize` vulnerability.
