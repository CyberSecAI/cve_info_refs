Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2263:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The provided documents don't specify the exact root cause for CVE-2014-2263. The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201603-06) lists CVE-2014-2263 among many other CVEs affecting FFmpeg. The advisory indicates that "Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg," and the listed CVEs should be reviewed for details. However, it does not provide specific details for each vulnerability listed, including CVE-2014-2263.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The Gentoo advisory states there are "Multiple vulnerabilities" which implies several weaknesses exist within the FFmpeg software. The vulnerabilities include potential weaknesses which could lead to arbitrary code execution and denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:
* Arbitrary code execution: This allows an attacker to run malicious code on the target system, potentially taking complete control.
* Denial of Service (DoS): This can cause the application or system to become unavailable, disrupting normal operations.

**Attack vectors:**

The advisory mentions that a "remote attacker" could exploit these vulnerabilities, which means the attack vector is over a network. The advisory does not specify the attack vector for each CVE. However the impact of code execution and denial of service means that the vulnerability is likely exploitable through the processing of a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

* A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities.
* The attacker requires the ability to send a malicious crafted input to a system running the affected version of FFmpeg.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Gentoo advisory indicates that the affected package is `media-video/ffmpeg` on all architectures.
- The vulnerable versions are those older than `2.6.3`.
- There is no workaround provided, and the resolution involves upgrading to the latest version of FFmpeg.
- The information indicates the presence of multiple vulnerabilities, suggesting a potentially complex situation for remediation.
