- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption vulnerability in Cisco WebEx ARF Player.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A remote attacker could cause the player to crash and, in some cases, execute arbitrary code on the targeted user's system.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to provide a malicious ARF file to the user. This can be done directly (e.g., via email) or by directing the user to a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious ARF file to the victim and convince them to open it with the vulnerable player.
