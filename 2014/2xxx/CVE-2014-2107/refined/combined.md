| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.1 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 5.9 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 5.9 |

The vulnerability is due to an issue in the Kailash field-programmable gate array (FPGA) versions prior to 2.6.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThis vulnerability affects only the Cisco 7600 Series Route Switch Processor 720 with 10 Gigabit Ethernet Uplinks models RSP720-3C-10GE and RSP720-3CXL-10GE that have onboard Kailash FPGA versions prior to 2.6 and are running a Cisco IOS Software release that does not contain the fix.      To determine the model of the Cisco 7600 Series Route Switch Processor 720, administrators can log in to the command-line interface (CLI) and issue the **show module** command. The output will indicate the model of the Cisco 7600 Series Route Switch Processor 720. The following example identifies a Cisco 7600 Series Route Switch Processor 720 with the model number RSP720-3CXL-10GE highlighted in **bold** text. ```   7600#show module Mod Ports Card Type                              Model              Serial No.--- ----- -------------------------------------- ------------------ -----------  1    5  Route Switch Processor 720 10GE (Activ RSP720-3CXL-10GE   JAE1219H6CQ  3   48  CEF720 48 port 10/100/1000mb Ethernet  WS-X6748-GE-TX     SAL1231Z8NVMod MAC addresses                       Hw    Fw           Sw           Status--- ---------------------------------- ------ ------------ ------------ -------  1  001d.4558.f340 to 001d.4558.f347   2.0   12.2(33r)SRC 12.2(33)SRE8 Ok  3  0022.9078.1110 to 0022.9078.113f   3.0   12.2(18r)S1  12.2(33)SRE8 OkMod  Sub-Module                  Model              Serial       Hw     Status ---- --------------------------- ------------------ ----------- ------- -------  1  Policy Feature Card 3       7600-PFC3CXL-10GE  JAE1220HV7W  1.1    Ok  1  C7600 MSFC4 Daughterboard   7600-MSFC4         JAE1220IC1F  2.0    Ok  3  Centralized Forwarding Card WS-F6700-CFC       SAL1129UYYS  3.1    OkMod  Online Diag Status ---- -------------------  1  Pass  3  Pass   ``` To determine the version of the Kailash FPGA, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show asic-version slot** .

The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableA Cisco 7600 Series router with a RSP720-3C-10GE or RSP720-3CXL-10GE that has an onboard Kailash FPGA version 2.6 or later, is not affected, and does not require a Cisco IOS Software upgrade.      The Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Supervisor Engines are not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * On RSP720-10GE, the CPUs Route Processor (RP) & Switch Processor (SP) are connected to the Kailash FPGA. These ports are known as the inband ports: RP-inband and SP-inband. In the Cisco 7600 Series platform, a majority of the packets are forwarded by the Encoded Address Recognition Logic (EARL). Packets sent to or from the CPUs include control packets, packets destined for the switch, and packets that cannot be forwarded by the EARL directly.      A vulnerability the Cisco 7600 Series Route Switch Processor 720 with 10 Gigabit Ethernet Uplinks models RSP720-3C-10GE and RSP720-3CXL-10GE with a Kailash FPGA version prior to 2.6, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the route switch processor to reboot or stop forwarding traffic.      The vulnerability is due to an issue in the Kailash FPGA versions prior to 2.6. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IP packets to or through the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the route processor to no longer forward traffic or reboot.      Potential indicators of exploitation will include the Kailash reset message; the module number will reflect the slot of the RSP720-10GE: ```   %PM_SCP-SP-2-LCP_FW_ERR_INFORM: Module 1 is experiencing the following error: TX in-band error. Invoking ka_gmac_reset   ``` Another indicator of exploitation is a hardware test fail message; the module number will reflect the slot of the RSP720-10GE: ```   %CONST_DIAG-SP-3-HM_TEST_FAIL: Module 1 TestSPRPInbandPing consecutive failure count:10   ``` The device will reload when the hardware test fails 10 times as shown in the previous error message and will reboot with a *%Software-forced reload* message.      This vulnerability can be triggered with IPv4 packets that are destined for or transitioning the Cisco 7600 Series Route Switch Processor. This vulnerability can potentially be triggered using IPv6.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID: [CSCug84789](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug84789) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only). This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2107  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for the vulnerability described in this Cisco Security Advisory.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.       In February 2014, Cisco announced details of an industry-wide issue with memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. Although the majority of Cisco products that use these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, a device reload or power cycle could expose component failures. While there are no known security implications associated with this issue, a subset of the affected products may experience a memory component failure during the software upgrade process. Cisco recommends customers review the related information and product-specific field notices at [www.cisco.com/go/memory](http://www.cisco.com/go/memory) before making upgrade decisions. Each Field Notice indicates whether the product could experience the memory component failure during a software upgrade. Cisco IOS Software The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) is the quickest method to determine exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The tool allows customers to quickly identify Cisco Security Advisories that impact specific Cisco IOS Software releases. Users can initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from their local system. The tool is also capable of parsing **show version** command output. Results can be customized by searching against all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all the advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication.       Customers can also use the Cisco IOS Software tables below to determine their exposure. Each row corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software release; if a particular release is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the second column. The third column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication.       **Expand to View Detailed Fixed Software Information**      | **Major Release** | **Availability of Repaired Releases** | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected 12.0-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.0-based releases | | |   | **Affected 12.2-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | 12.2EX | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable; First fixed in [Release 15.0SE](#15_0SE) |   | 12.2EY | Not vulnerable | Releases prior to 12.2(58)EY are vulnerable; Releases 12.2(58)EY and later are not vulnerable.
