- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web administration interface of the Fox DataDiode proxy server is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352) in the web-based administration interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can remotely exploit this vulnerability by tricking administrative users into performing actions that modify the proxy server's configuration.
    - This can lead to the addition or deletion of administrative users and modification of permissions.
    - Successful exploitation can result in an attacker gaining administrative control of the proxy server.
    - The disruption of information flow through the Fox DataDiode, potentially causing a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Remote exploitation via a malicious web page or link.
    - Requires social engineering to convince an administrative user to interact with the malicious content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML file containing a forged request targeting the vulnerable web interface.
    - The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrative user into loading the malicious HTML file in their browser while logged into the vulnerable web interface.
