# Chef Server 11.0.12 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Chef Server 11.0.12 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160,](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160) also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Chef Server should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be understated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Chef Server install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Chef Server, visit <https://www.getchef.com/chef/install>

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_open_source.html#upgrade-to-newer-versions-of-chef-server-11>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/open_source/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Chef Server install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Chef Server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Security Fixes

The following items are the set of security fixes that have been applied since Chef Server 11.0.11:

* [libcurl] Patch for wrong re-use of connections (CVE-2014-0138)
* [libcurl] Patch for address wildcard certificate validation (CVE-2014-0139)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Darwinssl (CVE-2014-1563)

## Synopsis

Important: libyaml security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0353)

## Topic

Updated libyaml packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 3.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
written in C.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library parsed URLs
in YAML documents. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input to
an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2014-2525)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library handled
excessively long YAML tags. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML
input to application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2013-6393)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-2525 issue.
oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter. The CVE-2013-6393 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the
Red Hat Product Security Team.

All libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

Enterprise Chef 1.4.9 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

## Release Notes

### Bug Fixes:

The following bug fixes have been applied since Enterprise Chef 1.4.8:

* [private-chef-cookbooks] Provide default value for jetty log path to fix dotfile deletion bug.
* [private-chef-ctl] private-chef-ctl password fixed to work correctly after a regression introduced in EC 1.4.6.
* [private-chef-cookbooks] Manage /var/log/opscode permissions even with non 0022 umask.

### Security Fixes:

The following items are the set of security fixes that have been applied since Enterprise Chef 1.4.8:

* [opscode-webui] Incorporate patches to address several identified potential Denial of Service vulnerabilities in the Rails framework.
* [libcurl] Patch for wrong re-use of connections (CVE-2014-0138)
* [libcurl] Patch for address wildcard certificate validation (CVE-2014-0139)
* [libcurl] Patch for not verifying certs for TLS to IP address / Darwinssl (CVE-2014-1563)

Package        : libyaml
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2525
Debian Bug     : 742732

Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team discovered a heap-based buffer
overflow vulnerability in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and emitter
library. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML
document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause
the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.3-1+deb6u4.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-2+deb7u4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

The issue is public.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: Fri, 09 Mar 2012 12:10:27 +0100 From: Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@redhat.com> Subject: [oss-security] CVE Request -- libdbd-pg-perl / perl-DBD-Pg && libyaml-libyaml-perl  / perl-YAML-LibYAML: Multiple format string flaws  [...]  Case #2: ======== Multiple format string flaws were found in the way perl-YAML-LibYAML, Perl YAML serialization using XS and libyaml, performed: 1) error reporting by loading of general YAML stream, 2) error reporting by loading of YAML node, 3) error reporting by loading of YAML mapping into a Perl hash, and 4) error reporting by loading of YAML sequence into a Perl array.  A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document, which once processed by the perl-YAML-LibYAML interface would lead to perl-YAML-LibYAML based process crash.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2885-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                      Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : libyaml-libyaml-perl
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2525

Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team discovered a heap-based buffer
overflow vulnerability in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and emitter
library. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML
document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause
the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application.

This update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the
libyaml-libyaml-perl package.

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.33-1+squeeze3.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.38-3+deb7u2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml-libyaml-perl packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-19 07:00:22 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libyaml parsed URLs. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original reporter.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-19 07:09:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 876237](attachment.cgi?id=876237&action=diff "patch from upstream") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=876237&action=edit "patch from upstream") patch from upstream   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-20 09:55:16 UTC  ``` libyaml is shipped as part of Red Hat Software Collections 1 via ruby193-libyaml package.  This package is used by ruby193-ruby.  Impact for this use case is limited, as ruby YAML module is unsafe for use on untrusted yaml input:  <http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/YAML.html#module-YAML-label-Security>  Alternative SafeYAML modules which provide safe ways to load yaml input files in ruby is not provided as part of Red Hat Software Collections 1.  <https://github.com/dtao/safe_yaml>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c18)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-27 00:33:16 UTC  ``` This issue is public now:  <http://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2014-003.html>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c19)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-27 00:36:11 UTC  ```  Created libyaml tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1081281](show_bug.cgi?id=1081281 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-2525 libyaml: heap-based buffer overflow when parsing URLs [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1078083#c20)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-27 07:01:08 UTC  ``` Debian released <http://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-2885> to fix this issue in their libyaml-libyaml-perl package. perl-YAML-LibYAML for Fedora and EPEL look to embed libyaml too, and it seems to get built (<http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org//packages/perl-YAML-LibYAML/0.41/3.fc20/data/logs/x86_64/build.log>), but I have not checked if it actually uses the embedded copy or not.

# CVE-2013-6393

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2013-6391.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2013-6394.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2013-6393 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6393)

#### Description

The yaml\_parser\_scan\_tag\_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**oCERT-2014-003 LibYAML input sanitization errors**

**Description**:

The [LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) project is an
open source YAML 1.1 parser and emitter written in C.

The library is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow which can lead
to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is caused by lack of proper
expansion for the string passed to the yaml\_parser\_scan\_uri\_escapes()
function.

A specially crafted YAML file, with a long sequence of percent-encoded
characters in a URL, can be used to trigger the overflow.

**Affected version**:

[LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) <= 0.1.5

**Fixed version**:

[LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) >= 0.1.6

**Credit**: vulnerability report received from Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team.

**CVE**: [CVE-2014-2525](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2525)

**Timeline**:

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for perl-YAML-LibYAML
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2016:1067-1
Rating: moderate
References: #860617 #868944 #907809 #911782
Cross-References: CVE-2013-6393 CVE-2014-2525 CVE-2014-9130
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 42.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
perl-YAML-LibYAML was updated to fix three security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2013-6393: The yaml\_parser\_scan\_tag\_uri function in scanner.c in
LibYAML before 0.1.5 performed an incorrect cast, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which
triggered a heap-based buffer overflow (bnc#860617, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2014-9130: scanner.c in LibYAML 0.1.5 and 0.1.6, as used in the
YAML-LibYAML (aka YAML-XS) module for Perl, allowed context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and crash) via
vectors involving line-wrapping (bnc#907809, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2014-2525: Heap-based buffer overflow in the
yaml\_parser\_scan\_uri\_escapes function in LibYAML before 0.1.6 allowed
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URI in a YAML file
(bnc#868944, bnc#911782).
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-12:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE Leap 42.1:

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
perl-YAML-LibYAML was updated to version 0.59 to fix four security issues.
These security issues were fixed:
- CVE-2013-6393: The yaml\_parser\_scan\_tag\_uri function in scanner.c in
LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which
triggers a heap-based buffer overflow (bnc#860617, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2012-1152: Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the error
reporting functionality in the YAML::LibYAML (aka YAML-LibYAML and
perl-YAML-LibYAML) module 0.38 for Perl allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (process crash) via format string specifiers
in a (1) YAML stream to the Load function, (2) YAML node to the
load\_node function, (3) YAML mapping to the load\_mapping function, or
(4) YAML sequence to the load\_sequence function (bnc#751503).
- CVE-2014-9130: scanner.c in LibYAML 0.1.5 and 0.1.6, as used in the
YAML-LibYAML (aka YAML-XS) module for Perl, allowed context-dependent
attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and crash) via
vectors involving line-wrapping (bnc#907809, bnc#911782).
- CVE-2014-2525: Heap-based buffer overflow in the
yaml\_parser\_scan\_uri\_escapes function in LibYAML before 0.1.6 allowed
context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long
sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URI in a YAML file
(bnc#868944, bnc#911782).
These non-security issues were fixed:
- PR/23 Better scalar dump heuristics
- More closely match YAML.pm
- Add a VERSION statement to YAML::LibYAML (issue#8)
- Applied fix for PR/21. nawglan++
- Use Swim cpan-tail block functions in doc
- Get YAML::XS using latest libyaml

# Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 Release

By  [Stephen Delano](/blog/author/stephen "Stephen Delano")

April 9, 2014

Enterprise Chef 11.1.3 is a security release that includes an updated version of OpenSSL that patches [CVE-2014-0160](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0160), also known as the [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com) bug. All installs of Enterprise Chef should be upgraded immediately. The result of this bug is a trivial exploit that allows an attacker to read secrets from the memory of a compromised server. These secrets can include any of the information stored within your Chef Server – usernames, passwords, node data, databags, etc. The severity of this exploit cannot be overstated. Please follow the upgrade instructions below carefully to ensure that your Enterprise Chef install is fully patched.

## Upgrade Instructions

### Download:

To download the latest version of Enterprise Chef, please contact your sales representative.

### Upgrade:

First, follow the upgrade instructions on the Chef Documentation site (linked below):

* **Standalone Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_standalone.html>
* **HA Installs:**  <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha.html>
  + **WARNING –** take special care to note the known issues with HA upgrades: <http://docs.opscode.com/upgrade_server_ha_notes.html#known-issues>

### Regenerating Certificates:

**NOTE –** Besides upgrading OpenSSL, this is the most important step in closing the vulnerability of the Heartbleed bug. The SSL certificates, as well as any of the secrets stored on your Chef Server, should be considered compromised to the network to which the Chef Server was available. Here are the steps needed to regenerate your SSL certificates:

Regenerate your SSL certificates by following the instructions on the Chef Documentation site here: <http://docs.opscode.com/server_security.html#regenerate-ssl-certificates>

Congratulations! Your Enterprise Chef install is now safe from the Heartbleed bug and any exploited SSL secrets can no longer be used to monitor your Chef traffic.

### Next Steps:

* **Changing Secrets –** While your Enterprise Chef install is now patched and safe from the Heartbleed bug, **it is still possible that arbitrary data from your Chef install was compromised.** Depending on your comfort level with the defense around your Enterprise Chef server, you may want to change user passwords and any other sensitive data that wasn’t encrypted via an out-of-band mechanism.
* **Chef Client –** Chef does authentication and authorization by signing each request, so you don’t have to worry about regenerating your client credentials.

Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Synopsis

Important: ruby193-libyaml security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0355)

## Topic

Updated ruby193-libyaml packages that fix two security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
written in C.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library parsed URLs
in YAML documents. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input to
an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2014-2525)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library handled
excessively long YAML tags. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML
input to application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2013-6393)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-2525 issue.
oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter. The CVE-2013-6393 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the
Red Hat Product Security Team.

All ruby193-libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

## Synopsis

Important: libyaml security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0354)

## Topic

Updated libyaml packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and
interaction with scripting languages. LibYAML is a YAML parser and emitter
written in C.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library parsed URLs
in YAML documents. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input to
an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2014-2525)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way the libyaml library handled
excessively long YAML tags. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML
input to application using libyaml could cause the application to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the application. (CVE-2013-6393)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting the CVE-2014-2525 issue.
oCERT acknowledges Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team as the original
reporter. The CVE-2013-6393 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of the
Red Hat Product Security Team.

All libyaml users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running
applications linked against the libyaml library must be restarted for this
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=868944#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-03-18 15:31:20 UTC  ``` via distros / OCERT, CRD March 26th  Hello,  I'd like to inform you about a LibYAML vulnerability that has been reported to oCERT and that is set for disclosure (with our own advisory) on the 26th of March around 18:00 GMT.  The vulnerability is a heap overflow and was confirmed on LibYAML 0.1.5 (latest version). The vulnerability is caused by not properly expanding a string before writing to it in function yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes in scanner.c on the following line:          *(string->pointer++) = octet;  and can be triggered by parsing a .yaml file with a long sequence of percent-encoded charaters in a url. Attached to this message is a PoC .yaml file that demonstrates the vulnerability.  I am also attaching the patch provided by LibYAML author which has been verified by the reporter.  The issue has been discovered and reported by Ivan Fratric <ifratric@google.com> of the Google Security Team.  I should get a CVE assigned soon, I'll let you know when I get it.

The library is affected by a heap-based buffer overflow which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability is caused by lack of proper expansion for the string passed to the yaml_parser_scan_uri_escapes() function.  A specially crafted YAML file, with a long sequence of percent-encoded characters in a URL, can be used to trigger the overflow.

Advisory: ========================  Updated libyaml packages fix security vulnerabilities:  Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team discovered a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted YAML document that, when parsed by an application using libyaml, would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application (CVE-2014-2525).
