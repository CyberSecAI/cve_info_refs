#### Vulnerability Note VU#402020

Original Release Date: 2014-07-03 | Last Revised: 2014-07-03

---

### Overview

Autodesk VRED contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability.

### Description

| [CWE-78](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html): Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'):  Autodesk VRED Professional 2014 contains an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability. Autodesk VRED Professional 2014 contains an integrated web server that binds to port tcp/8888 which is accessible remotely. It has been reported that this web server gives access to a Python API which provides users with a vast amount of libraries which could allow an attacker to execute operating system commands. Through this API, Python code can be executed on the target system, the output is returned in the web server response. By importing the Python “os” library, arbitrary operating system commands can be executed on the target system with the privileges of the user running VRED Professional 2014. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker can execute operating system commands with the privileges of the user running VRED Professional 2014. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Autodesk has released VRED 2014 SR1 SP8 to address this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade to VRED 2014 SR1 SP8 or later. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**As a general good security practice, only allow connections from trusted hosts and networks. Restricting access would prevent an attacker from accessing the web interface using stolen credentials from a blocked network location. |
