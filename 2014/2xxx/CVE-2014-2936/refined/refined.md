The provided content contains information about CVE-2014-2936.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the ability to manipulate variables in the global scope in the directory manager component of Caldera 9.20.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to Dynamic Variable Evaluation (CWE-627). Several scripts allow overwriting of defined variables with arbitrary values during script runtime, specifically:
* `/PPD/index.php`
* `/dirmng/docmd.php`
* `/dirmng/index.php`
* `/dirmng/param.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite defined variables and enable the upload function to store code within the web root directory structure, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves manipulating global variables through vulnerable scripts. For example, an attacker can send a request like `/dirmng/index.php?maindir_hotfolder=/var/www/caldera/html/` to overwrite the `maindir_hotfolder` variable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the vulnerable scripts.
