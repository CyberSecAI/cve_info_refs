Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2066:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a session fixation issue in Jenkins. The application did not invalidate the existing session after a successful login, which allowed an attacker to potentially fixate a user's session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Session Fixation: The application fails to invalidate the existing session upon successful authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: An attacker can potentially hijack a user's session by setting a known session ID before the user logs in. If the application does not invalidate the session ID after authentication, the attacker can reuse this ID to gain access to the user's account. This can lead to unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or control network traffic between the user and the Jenkins server to set a fixed session ID.
- Cookie Manipulation: An attacker might attempt to manipulate or override the Jenkins cookies in the victim's browser through various means, like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or if the attacker controls the client network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Control/MitM: The attacker needs to have the capability to intercept or manipulate network traffic or user's cookies.
- Cookie manipulation capabilities
- The attacker does not need to be a valid Jenkins user

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit (`8ac74c350779921598f9d5edfed39dd35de8842a`) shows that the fix involved invalidating the HTTP session immediately after successful authentication. This is done in the `AuthenticationProcessingFilter2.java` file, by adding a call to `request.getSession().invalidate()` after a successful authentication.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity because it requires the attacker to control the victim's network or cookies.
- The advisory suggests that this vulnerability is difficult to exploit unless combined with other exploits on the network.

This analysis provides more detailed information than the official CVE description, which only states that Jenkins was vulnerable to session fixation.
