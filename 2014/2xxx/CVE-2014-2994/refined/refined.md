      "vulnerabilityDetails": "This article confirms the vulnerability exists in Acunetix v8 (build 20120704), but has been fixed in a subsequent release from January 2013. The vulnerability was exploited using a cracked version of the software from 2012, and legitimate users of more recent Acunetix versions are not affected."

        "rootCause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs when Acunetix processes external domain names with lengths greater than 268 bytes during a scan.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Buffer Overflow",
          "Improper input validation"

        "impact": "Remote code execution on the machine running the vulnerable version of Acunetix. An attacker can gain full control over the scanning machine, bypassing security measures such as proxies and TOR.",
        "attackVectors": [
          "The attacker includes a specially crafted URL with a domain name longer than 268 bytes within the HTML content of a website. When Acunetix scans this website, it processes the URL, causing the overflow."
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker must be able to host a web page which the victim scans using a vulnerable version of Acunetix (v8 build 20120704) . The attacker needs the ability to inject crafted external source links into this webpage."

         "attackVectors": [
          "By including a specially crafted external domain name with a length greater than 268 bytes in a web page, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability when scanned by the vulnerable version of Acunetix."
        ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to host the exploit page on a web server and needs the target user to initiate a scan via a vulnerable version of Acunetix. The victim must also select the external host for the scan to be triggered."
