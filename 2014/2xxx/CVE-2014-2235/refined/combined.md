How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1070852#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-27 15:26:09 UTC  ``` Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) issues were found in askbot (Question and Answer forum web application written in python and django) affecting various search forms (question, tag, and user searches).  These issue were corrected in upstream version 0.7.49.  Relevant upstream changes (two of the forms were fixed as part of the larger commit with unrelated changes): <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/commit/876e3662ff6b78cc6241338c15e3a0cb49edf4e2#diff-6868da9ad7c82c149086e59fac3af76b> <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/commit/876e3662ff6b78cc6241338c15e3a0cb49edf4e2#diff-b693b4c02739be4b3231bece15b0eb87> <https://github.com/ASKBOT/askbot-devel/commit/a676a86b6b7a5737d4da4f59f71e037406f88d29>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1070852#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-27 15:30:30 UTC  ``` The question search XSS was reported by Kamil Sevi (@kamilsevi) for askbot running on <https://ask.fedoraproject.org/> .  Additional issues were noticed when investigating the report.  All issue were fixed upstream in a released 0.7.49 at the time of the report.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1070852#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-27 15:30:58 UTC  ```  Created askbot tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1070858](show_bug.cgi?id=1070858 "CLOSED EOL - askbot: multiple XSS issues fixed in 0.7.49 [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1070852#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-28 20:30:47 UTC  ``` [CVE-2014-2235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2235) was assigned to the question search XSS, [CVE-2014-2236](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2236) to the tag and user search XSS.  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/28/8>   ``` |  |
