Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2235:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `askbot` application. Specifically, the question search form was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious code can be injected through the vulnerable search form, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the search results. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user viewing the injected code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in Browser:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various impacts including:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies, granting the attacker access to the user's account.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information that the user has access to within the application.
    *   **Redirection:** Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the web page the user is viewing.
    *   **Malware delivery**: Redirecting to sites that download malware.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Search Form Injection:** The attack vector is the `askbot` search form. The attacker would craft a malicious URL that includes the malicious javascript as the search query which would then be stored and displayed. When a user views the results page the javascript would execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** An attacker would need to know which form input is vulnerable and how to inject the malicious code.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs the ability to inject a javascript payload in the vulnerable field to execute malicious code on the victim's browser.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the `askbot` application, specifically in the search functionality.
*   The issue was reported by Kamil Sevi (@kamilsevi).
*   The fix is included in `askbot` version 0.7.49 and includes sanitizing user supplied search queries.
*   CVE-2014-2236 was assigned to other XSS vulnerabilities discovered while investigating this issue. These include the tag and user search forms, as indicated in the bug report.
