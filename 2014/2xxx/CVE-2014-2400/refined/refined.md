{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-2400",
      "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `op` parameter of the `/config` and `/admin` URLs, leading to the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code into the HTML document.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Insufficient input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other Endeca Latitude users. This can lead to various attacks such as cookie stealing, displaying fake login forms, and potentially controlling the Endeca Latitude instance via its API.",
      "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the 'op' parameter and enticing a user to visit the URL.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it. No special privileges or access to the target system are needed initially.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present because the application directly embeds the invalid value of the HTTP GET parameter 'op' into the document without proper escaping. The vendor decided not to fix the issue, and instead recommended configuring mutual TLS authentication."
