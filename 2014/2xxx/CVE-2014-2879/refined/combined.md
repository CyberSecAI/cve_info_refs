Severity Level:
===============
Low
Technical Details & Description:
================================
Multiple persistent input validation web vulnerabilities has been discovered in the official Dell SonicWall EMail Security Appliance v7.4.6 Web-Application.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers or low privileged user accounts to inject own malicious script codes via POST method request to compromise the
application or user session data/information.
The first vulnerability is located in the `filename` value of the `settings\_advanced.html` file. Remote attackers and low privileged application user accounts
are able to inject own malicious script codes on the application-side of the `Advanced Settings - Patch hochladen > Patch-Datei` module. Attackers can manipulate
the file upload POST method request by tampering the session. Next to tampering the session the attacker exchange the file name with a malicious script code
as payload. In the next step the website reloads the next firmware upgrade page (wait.html) with the file details. The execute of the injected script code
via POST method request occurs at the location of the listed file name value. The security risk of the persistent validation web vulnerability is estimated
as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.5(-).
The second vulnerability is located in the file name value of the settings\_upload\_dlicense.html file. Remote attackers and low privileged application user accounts
are able to inject own malicious script codes on the application-side of the Lizenz Verwaltung - Lizenzen Upload module. The request method is POST and the attack
vector is persistent. The execute occurs in the exception context of the license update page module. The security risk of the persistent validation web
vulnerability is estimated as medium with a cvss (common vulnerability scoring system) count of 3.0(+).
Exploitation of both vulnerabilities requires to bypass the regular validation of the web application appliance. To bypass the filter remote attackers can inject two
payloads with a split in the middle. The validation encodes the first injected payload and the second after the split executes the code.
Exploitation of the remote web vulnerabilities requires a privileged user account without user interaction or a remote user with medium to high user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the persistent web vulnerabilities results in session hijacking, persistent external redirects, persistent phishing and persistent
manipulation of vulnerable connected or affected modules.
Request Method:
[+] POST
Vulnerable Module:
[+] Advanced Settings - Patch hochladen > Patch-Datei (settings\_advanced.html)
[+] Lizenz Verwaltung - Lizenzen Upload > (settings\_upload\_dlicense.html)

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Both vulnerabilities can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the file name value in the 2 affected upload POST method requests.
Filter and encode also in the wait.html and license exception the vulnerable output values even if the input is still parsed.
SonicWall Solution:
============
We recommend existing users of Dell SonicWALL Email Security upgrade to version 7.4.6 to prevent this cross-site script injection from being executed by unauthorized users.
Email Security 7.4.6 is available for download from www.mysonicwall.com. Users should log into mySonicWALL and click on Downloads > Download Center in the navigation panel
in the left-hand navigation, then select “Email Security” in the Software Type drop down menu.
Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent and non persistent post inject web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.

The second vulnerability is located in the file name value of the settings_upload_dlicense.html file. Remote attackers

module. The request method is POST and the attack

Exploitation of both vulnerabilities requires to bypass the regular validation of the web application appliance. To
bypass the filter remote attackers can inject two
payloads with a split in the middle. The validation encodes the first injected payload and the second after the split
executes the code.

Exploitation of the remote web vulnerabilities requires a privileged user account without user interaction or a remote

Content-Type: image/jpeg

Solution - Fix & Patch:
=======================
Both vulnerabilities can be patched by a secure parse and encode of the file name value in the 2 affected upload POST
method requests.
Filter and encode also in the wait.html and license exception the vulnerable output values even if the input is still
parsed.

SonicWall Solution:
============
We recommend existing users of Dell SonicWALL Email Security upgrade to version 7.4.6 to prevent this cross-site script
injection from being executed by unauthorized users.
Email Security 7.4.6 is available for download from www.mysonicwall.com. Users should log into mySonicWALL and click on
Downloads > Download Center in the navigation panel
in the left-hand navigation, then select “Email Security” in the Software Type drop down menu.

Security Risk:
==============
The security risk of the persistent and non persistent post inject web vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.
