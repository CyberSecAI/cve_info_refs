Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2340:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of the HTTP request origin by the XCloner WordPress plugin. This lack of verification allows an attacker to forge requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF (CWE-352). The plugin does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Backup Creation:** A successful CSRF attack allows the attacker to force a logged-in administrator to create a full website backup.
*   **Public Exposure of Backup:** The created backup, containing all website files (though not the SQL database, according to the provided exploit), is publicly accessible via a predictable URL (e.g., `http://[host]/administrator/backups/backup.tar`). This exposes the site's content to unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a specially crafted webpage controlled by the attacker.
*   **Malicious Webpage:** The crafted webpage contains malicious HTML form that submits a request to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious webpage.
*   **No Direct Access Required:** The attacker doesn't need direct access to the WordPress server, only to have an administrator visit their malicious page while logged in to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided exploit code is straightforward HTML and JavaScript, which demonstrates the ease of exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is specific to XCloner WordPress plugin version 3.1.0 and likely prior versions, and has been addressed in version 3.1.1.

In summary, CVE-2014-2340 is a CSRF vulnerability in the XCloner WordPress plugin that allows an attacker to force a logged-in administrator to create a publicly accessible website backup by tricking them into visiting a specially crafted webpage.
