##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Description

[XCloner](https://www.xcloner.com) is a backup plugin that allows you to safely back up and restore your WordPress sites. You can send your site backups to SFTP, Dropbox, Amazon, Google Drive, Backblaze and other locations. You can create backups manually or automatically with XCloner’s built-in scheduler.

XCloner enables you to automatically generate backups with the built-in cron script. These cron jobs can run daily, weekly, monthly or even hourly.

XCloner allows you to generate custom backups of any WordPress site, and then restore the backup on any other location with the help of the automatic restore script we provide!

XCloner has many useful safety features. For example, XCloner will generate a core, plugins, themes or languages files backup before the automatic update of WordPress core, plugins, themes or languages files.

#### Remote Storage for WordPress Backups

XCloner allows you to send your backups to remote storage locations supporting FTP, SFTP, DropBox, Amazon S3, Google Drive, WebDAV, Backblaze, Azure and many more to come

You can generate “Differential Backups” so your backup will include only files modified after a certain date. This can decrease the space needed to store your backups.

XCloner also has safety features to make sure your backups are successful. One example: you have the ability to split backups into multiple smaller parts if a certain size limit is reached. Another example: XCloner can also store a local copy of the backup that it will then delete when the backup has been sent to the remote location.

#### Secure, GDPR Compliant WordPress Backups

XCloner is the best backup choice for people who care about security and privacy.

XCloner uses open source standards like TAR, MySQL and CSV formats so you can be sure that your backups can be restored in a variety of ways, giving you more flexibility and full control.

XCloner has a built-in security layer to protect your backups. You can create encrypted backup archives with AES-128-CBC algorithm. This encryption helps to ensure that your data is still GDPR compliant even if the backup fails.

#### Restore Backups Anywhere

You can restore backups on any location compatible with your website by using the XCloner restore feature. Your site clone can be restored on a totally different server, with new server and MySQL details.

XCloner will attempt to extract the backup archive files for you, as well as import the MySQL dump and update your WordPress configuration details.

The restore script is located inside the XCloner archive, in the /restore/ directory. XCloner can restore your original file and directory permissions. XCloner can also automatically update the new host settings to the configuration file.

XCloner has a variety of restoration options including: All Files, Only Plugins Files, Only Theme Files, Only Uploads Files, and Only Database Backup.

#### XCloner works best with the Watchful dashboard

[Watchful](https://watchful.net) is a web developers toolbox for remotely managing and monitoring multiple WordPress websites. Simply add all your production and staging sites into the Watchful Dashboard and use our tools to monitor uptime and site backups, plus updates to WordPress and core and plugins, and more. XCloner integrates smoothly with Watchful. You’ll be amazed at how much time and money you save managing your WordPress sites with [Watchful](https://wordpress.org/plugins/watchful/).

## FAQ

### Where does XCloner keep it’s Database Backups?

XCloner stores them in separate mysql dump files, inside a folder called xcloner-XXXXX inside the backup archive root path, where XXXXX is a hash number that is identical with the last 5 characters of the backup name,

so if the backup name is backup\_localhost-2017-02-16\_15-36-sql-1c6c6.tgz , the mysql backup file will be stored in xcloner-1c6c6/ folder.

### How do I Restore my Backup?

XCloner provide an easy to use restore script available in the Site Backup -> Restore Backups menu, the process is being described there as well.

If the XCloner Restore option fails, you can manually restore your backup as follows:

1. extract the backup archive files to your new location
2. locate the xcloner-XXXXX folder inside your backup root folder, and look for the mysql backup in database-sql and import it through phpmyadmin
3. update your wp-config.php file to reflect the new mysql details

### How do I know which Files were include in the Backup?

The XCloner Manager Backups Panel provides an easy utility to view each backup content files list. It also stores a copy of the archived backup files inside the xcloner-XXXXX/backup\_files.csv file in an easy to read CSV format.

### Do you have a Log for the created Backup?

Yes, if XCloner Logger option is enabled, it will store a log file inside the xcloner-XXXXX folder inside the backup archive, file is named xcloner-xxxxx.log

### What are Differentials Backups?

Differential Backups contain files modified after a certian period of time. So each time backup runs, modified files after that period of time are added to a new Backup archive.

Compared to Incremental Backups, which contain only modified files from the previous run, they use more space but are more reliable for files restore.

They will use considerably less space than a full backup however.

### Why Differential Backups and will you support Incremental Backups?

The main difference comes from how reliable a backup set it. For instance, if something happens to one backup archive from the Incremental Backup set, then it is possible you will lose

the files changes in that period of time, however if the same case happens to a Differential Backup, then the files can easily be recovered from any of the other Differential Backups. The

storage difference between Incremental Backups and Differential Backups is not significant and considering the reliability of the Differential Set so we have decided, for now, to not implement

further Incremental Backups.

### What would a good Backup Procedure be with Differential Backups?

As a general rule, I would recommend setting a weekly full site backup schedule and then a daily schedule for a differential backup. You can also include a daily backup of the database in the same Differential Backup.

Of course, schedules can be adjusted accordingly to how often you update your site, the size of it and the storage space available.

I appreciate this is possibly the only free plugin that connects to some cloud storage providers like Backblaze. Unfortunately the plugin is a bit too buggy to rely on currently. The devs seem relatively responsive to support threads, so here’s hoping it will improve going forward.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
