Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-2248:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation or sanitization within the integrated web server of the affected devices when handling user-supplied URLs. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious URL and cause the web server to redirect users to an untrusted website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Open Redirect (CWE-601): The web server fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied URLs, leading to the possibility of redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead users to be redirected to untrusted websites, potentially exposing them to phishing attacks, malware downloads, or other malicious activities. This can compromise the integrity and confidentiality of user data and systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks targeting the integrated web server through ports 80/tcp and 443/tcp.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted request containing a malicious URL to the affected device's web server.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability but user interaction is required to follow the redirect.
-The attacker can be remote to the device, as the attack is network-based.
