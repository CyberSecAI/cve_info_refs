### Bug Description

nova rescue of VM on vmWare will create a additional VM ($ORIGINAL\_ID-rescue), but after that, the original VM has status ACTIVE. This leads to

[root@jhenner-node ~(keystone\_admin)]# nova unrescue foo

ERROR: Cannot 'unrescue' while instance is in vm\_state stopped (HTTP 409) (Request-ID: req-792cabb2-2102-47c5-9b15-96c74a9a4819)

the original can be deleted, which then causes leaking of the -rescue VM.

This doesn't seem to be a VC driver issue, I have tried this with the libvirt driver and the same problem happens. The state of the VM is not being set correctly.

I'm not convinced the leaking of the rescue VM is a security issue. Does it let the user circumvent its quota and the extra VMs could be used to overload compute nodes without generating any cost ?

I have checked that this bug allows the user to pass the limits, so this can lead to DOS and also may lead to consuming more resources than has been paid for.

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova boot --image cirros-0.3.1-x86\_64-disk.vmdk --flavor m1.micro foo-$i;

done

# Wait for them to spin-up to ACTIVE state. The limit is 10VMs. No more VMs can be spun up by thi tenant.

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova rescue foo-$i;

done

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova delete foo-$i;

done

# \*-rescue machines are still there, in running state

# -- consuming RAM and disk space

# Goto the begining. We can spin-up 10 more VMs.

I have also checked that this problem is not present when using the libvirt/KVM VMs on local disk. The -rescue disk-file is created in the directory of the VM, which gets removed when the VM is being deleted. That holds for Grizzly and Havana release.

If Jaroslav's analysis is correct than I think we should move to get a CVE assigned for this. (ttx do you agree?).

I've drafted an impact analysis (below). I'm not sure about the versions. I'm assuming this was introduced by this commit: 8db2f23a43cf8aff21d7ef07af742383c275dd76, however I will need a developer to confirm this problem and the cause.

Versions: 2013.2

Description:

Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova. By

requesting Nova place an image into rescue, then deleting

the image an authenticated user my exceed their quota. This can

result in a denial of service via excessive resource consumption.

Only setups using the Nova VMWare driver are affected.

Correct, the problem is specific to VMware. More specifically if a instance ins deleted after a resuce then a rescus VM will still exist on the backend.

Impact description looks good. I would add a comma between "the image" and "an authenticated user", for clarity.

Also would be good to get confirmation on the affected versions.

Grant, looks like it should be "Versions: from 2013.2 to 2013.2.2" (assuming it does not affect releases prior to Havana and will be fixed in the 2013.2.3 stable branch point release).

VMware: ensure rescue instance is deleted when instance is deleted

If the user creates a rescue instance and then proceeded to delete

    the original instance then the rescue instance would still be up

    and running on the backend.

This patch ensures that the rescue instance is cleaned up if

    necessary.

The vmops unrescue method has a new parameter indicating if

    the original VM should be powered on.

VMware: ensure rescue instance is deleted when instance is deleted

If the user creates a rescue instance and then proceeded to delete

    the original instance then the rescue instance would still be up

    and running on the backend.

This patch ensures that the rescue instance is cleaned up if

    necessary.

The vmops unrescue method has a new parameter indicating if

    the original VM should be powered on.

It fails to unrescue when the vmware VM is in powered-on state and also it seems to be leaking when the vm is in ERROR state.

### Bug Description

nova rescue of VM on vmWare will create a additional VM ($ORIGINAL\_ID-rescue), but after that, the original VM has status ACTIVE. This leads to

[root@jhenner-node ~(keystone\_admin)]# nova unrescue foo

ERROR: Cannot 'unrescue' while instance is in vm\_state stopped (HTTP 409) (Request-ID: req-792cabb2-2102-47c5-9b15-96c74a9a4819)

the original can be deleted, which then causes leaking of the -rescue VM.

This doesn't seem to be a VC driver issue, I have tried this with the libvirt driver and the same problem happens. The state of the VM is not being set correctly.

I'm not convinced the leaking of the rescue VM is a security issue. Does it let the user circumvent its quota and the extra VMs could be used to overload compute nodes without generating any cost ?

I have checked that this bug allows the user to pass the limits, so this can lead to DOS and also may lead to consuming more resources than has been paid for.

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova boot --image cirros-0.3.1-x86\_64-disk.vmdk --flavor m1.micro foo-$i;

done

# Wait for them to spin-up to ACTIVE state. The limit is 10VMs. No more VMs can be spun up by thi tenant.

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova rescue foo-$i;

done

for i in {1..10}; do

  nova delete foo-$i;

done

# \*-rescue machines are still there, in running state

# -- consuming RAM and disk space

# Goto the begining. We can spin-up 10 more VMs.

I have also checked that this problem is not present when using the libvirt/KVM VMs on local disk. The -rescue disk-file is created in the directory of the VM, which gets removed when the VM is being deleted. That holds for Grizzly and Havana release.

If Jaroslav's analysis is correct than I think we should move to get a CVE assigned for this. (ttx do you agree?).

I've drafted an impact analysis (below). I'm not sure about the versions. I'm assuming this was introduced by this commit: 8db2f23a43cf8aff21d7ef07af742383c275dd76, however I will need a developer to confirm this problem and the cause.

Title: Nova VMWare driver leaks rescued images

Reporter: Jaroslav Henner (Red Hat)

Products: Nova

Versions: 2013.2

Description:

Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova. By

requesting Nova place an image into rescue, then deleting

the image an authenticated user my exceed their quota. This can

result in a denial of service via excessive resource consumption.

Only setups using the Nova VMWare driver are affected.

Correct, the problem is specific to VMware. More specifically if a instance ins deleted after a resuce then a rescus VM will still exist on the backend.

Impact description looks good. I would add a comma between "the image" and "an authenticated user", for clarity.

Also would be good to get confirmation on the affected versions.

Grant, looks like it should be "Versions: from 2013.2 to 2013.2.2" (assuming it does not affect releases prior to Havana and will be fixed in the 2013.2.3 stable branch point release).

VMware: ensure rescue instance is deleted when instance is deleted

If the user creates a rescue instance and then proceeded to delete

    the original instance then the rescue instance would still be up

    and running on the backend.

This patch ensures that the rescue instance is cleaned up if

    necessary.

The vmops unrescue method has a new parameter indicating if

    the original VM should be powered on.

Subject: CVE request for vulnerability in OpenStack Nova

A vulnerability was discovered in OpenStack (see below). In order to
ensure full traceability, we need a CVE number assigned that we can
attach to further notifications. This issue is already public, although
an advisory was not sent yet.

Title: Nova VMWare driver leaks rescued images
Reporter: Jaroslav Henner (Red Hat)
Products: Nova
Versions: 2013.2 to 2013.2.2

Description:
Jaroslav Henner from Red Hat reported a vulnerability in Nova. By
requesting Nova place an image into rescue, then deleting
the image, an authenticated user my exceed their quota. This can
result in a denial of service via excessive resource consumption. Only
setups using the Nova VMWare driver are affected.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
