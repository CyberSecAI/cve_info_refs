{
  "cve": "CVE-2014-2573",
  "affected_product": "OpenStack Nova",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute does not properly handle the rescue process. When a VM is put into rescue mode, a new VM (named $ORIGINAL_ID-rescue) is created. However, the original VM's status is not correctly set to 'RESCUE', and it remains in an 'ACTIVE' state. Subsequently deleting the original VM does not remove the '-rescue' VM from the backend.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect state management of VMs during rescue operations",
      "Failure to clean up rescue VMs upon deletion of the original VM"
     ],
    "impact": "Authenticated users can exceed their resource quotas by repeatedly creating and deleting VMs in rescue mode, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by exhausting resources (RAM and disk space) and potentially consuming more resources than paid for. The leaked rescue VMs continue to run in the background.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting the 'rescue' functionality of OpenStack Nova via the VMWare driver.",
      "Repeatedly placing VMs in rescue mode and then deleting the original VMs."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Authenticated user access to OpenStack Nova with the ability to create and manage VMs."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "2013.2 to 2013.2.2"
  ],
    "fix_versions": [
    "2013.2.3",
    "2014.1.1",
    "2014.2"
