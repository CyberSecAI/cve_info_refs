Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2250:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the **low entropy** in the random number generator used by the integrated web server of the affected Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 CPUs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Entropy in PRNG (CWE-332):** The core weakness is the inadequate randomness in the generation of session tokens, making them predictable.
*   The affected web server runs on ports 80/tcp (HTTP) and 443/tcp (HTTPS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially predict session tokens, allowing them to hijack active web sessions.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Compromised:** Successful session hijacking can lead to the attacker gaining control of the authenticated web session, potentially leading to unauthorized access, modification, and disruption of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Session Token Prediction:** The attack relies on the ability to predict the session tokens due to the low entropy in the random number generation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected PLC.
*   **Token Prediction Capability:** The attacker needs to have the ability or tools to predict the session tokens due to the flawed random number generator.
*   **User Interaction** Based on the CVSS vector, User Interaction is required (UI:R)

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the integrated web server of the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family.
*   The affected versions are all versions prior to V4.0.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
*   The provided documents from both Siemens and ICS-CERT corroborate these findings.

This vulnerability is addressed in the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU product release V4.0.
