Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The AVG Secure Search toolbar includes an ActiveX control (ScriptHelperApi, provided by ScriptHelper.exe) that exposes insecure methods. This control is marked as "Safe for Scripting" but does not enforce any restrictions on which websites can invoke its methods. Additionally, the installer for AVG Secure Search sets the `ElevationPolicy` registry value, which excludes the control from the Internet Explorer Protected Mode sandbox, and sets the `Preapproved` registry value, bypassing the ActiveX Opt-In feature.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe ActiveX Methods:** The ScriptHelper ActiveX control contains unsafe methods that can be exploited.
- **Lack of Site Restrictions:** The control does not restrict which sites can invoke its methods, allowing any website to interact with it.
- **Bypassed Internet Explorer Security Features:** The installer bypasses Internet Explorer's Protected Mode sandbox and ActiveX Opt-In feature, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user viewing the malicious content. This can be achieved by convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page, HTML email, or attachment).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
- **Social Engineering:** Requires convincing the user to view a specially crafted HTML document.
- **Internet Explorer:**  The vulnerability specifically targets Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML document.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to open the document via social engineering.
- **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
