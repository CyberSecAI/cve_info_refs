Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2441:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2441

**Component:** Oracle VM VirtualBox

**Vulnerability:** Graphics driver(WDDM) for Windows guests

**Root Cause:** The document doesn't specify the root cause of the vulnerability, but it exists within the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) graphics driver used in VirtualBox when running Windows guest operating systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the graphics driver for Windows guest operating systems within the VirtualBox virtualization software. 

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Specifically:
  - **Confidentiality:**  An attacker may gain access to some sensitive information.
  - **Integrity:** An attacker may be able to make unauthorized modifications to data.
  - **Availability:** An attacker may be able to disrupt normal operation of the Virtual Machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to be able to execute code within the guest Windows VM to trigger the vulnerability.
  - It is not remotely exploitable without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - An attacker requires the ability to execute code within a Windows guest VM that is running on a vulnerable version of VirtualBox.

**Affected Versions:**
  - VirtualBox versions prior to 4.1.32, 4.2.24, and 4.3.10

**CVSS Score:**
  - Base Score: 4.4
  - Access Vector: Local
  - Access Complexity: Medium
  - Authentication: None
  - Confidentiality Impact: Partial
  - Integrity Impact: Partial
  - Availability Impact: Partial+

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability requires a guest OS running Windows.

This vulnerability is not remotely exploitable without authentication and requires local access on the guest OS.
