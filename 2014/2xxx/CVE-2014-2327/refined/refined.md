Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2014-2327:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Cacti. This means that an attacker can potentially force a logged-in user to perform unintended actions on the Cacti application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could hijack the authentication of users, leading to the execution of unintended commands.
- Specific examples of actions an attacker could force a user to perform include:
    - Modifying binary files.
    - Modifying configurations.
    - Adding arbitrary users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a malicious webpage or link.
- An attacker tricks a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page (or clicking a malicious link), which then sends forged requests to the Cacti application.
- These requests are executed within the user's authenticated session, thus achieving the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the victim to be a logged-in user of the vulnerable Cacti application.
- The attacker must be able to trick the user into accessing a malicious web page or link.
- No special privileges are required, but the attacker needs to exploit the user's existing session.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects Cacti versions 0.8.7g, 0.8.8b, and earlier.
- The vulnerability is addressed in subsequent releases (e.g., 0.8.8a+dfsg-5+deb7u3 in Debian wheezy, 0.8.8b+dfsg-6 in Debian testing/unstable, and 0.8.7g-1+squeeze4 in Debian squeeze).
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
