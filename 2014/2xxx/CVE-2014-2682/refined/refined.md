Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the failure to recognize that the `libxml_disable_entity_loader` setting in PHP is shared across threads in a PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) environment. This means that if one thread disables the entity loader, it affects other threads as well, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and security issues, especially when dealing with XML parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** This CVE highlights an incomplete fix from a previous vulnerability (CVE-2012-5657). The initial fix did not consider the thread-shared nature of the `libxml_disable_entity_loader` setting in PHP-FPM environments.
*   **Shared Resource:** The `libxml_disable_entity_loader` setting acts as a shared resource amongst threads within the PHP-FPM process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks:** The vulnerability can lead to XXE attacks. By manipulating XML input, an attacker could potentially force the application to access arbitrary files or establish TCP connections, leading to information disclosure or other security breaches.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not explicitly mentioned for this specific CVE, the related XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks are mentioned as a broader impact due to incomplete fixes for XML handling in Zend Framework which can cause denial of service due to excessive resource consumption by processing malicious XML with recursively defined entities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML Input:** The primary attack vector is through the injection of maliciously crafted XML documents that contain external entities or entity expansion structures into the affected application.
*   **PHP-FPM:** This vulnerability specifically targets setups using PHP-FPM, as it exploits the shared nature of the `libxml_disable_entity_loader` setting within multi-threaded processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to submit XML:** The attacker needs to be able to submit XML data to the application that is processed using the vulnerable functions (`simplexml_load_*`, `DOMDocument::loadXML`, or `xml_parse`).
*   **Knowledge of XML:** The attacker needs knowledge of XML and how to exploit it to cause either XXE or XEE attacks.
*   **Target environment running PHP-FPM:** To leverage the specific threading issue, the target application has to be running in a PHP-FPM environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability impacts multiple versions of Zend Framework (both 1.x and 2.x).
*   The fix involves scanning and loading XML documents using `Zend_Xml_Security` (in ZF1) and `ZendXml` to disable loading of external entities via `libxml_disable_entity_loader` and also checking for ENTITY declarations in the document type definition, throwing an exception upon detection.
*   The vulnerability is related to incomplete fixes from CVE-2012-5657 and the shared nature of `libxml_disable_entity_loader` in PHP-FPM environments.

In summary, CVE-2014-2682 highlights a vulnerability in Zend Framework's XML processing that, when coupled with the threading behavior of PHP-FPM, could expose applications to XML-based attacks (XXE, XEE) if the application processes untrusted XML data.
