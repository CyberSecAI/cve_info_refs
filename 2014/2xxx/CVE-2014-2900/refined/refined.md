{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "CyaSSL accepted certificates with unknown critical extensions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation. Certificate validation must fail if unknown critical extensions are present in the certificate.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use a certificate with an unknown critical extension to bypass security checks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to present a crafted X.509 certificate to a CyaSSL client or server that contains an unrecognized critical extension.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to present a certificate to the CyaSSL implementation during a TLS handshake."
