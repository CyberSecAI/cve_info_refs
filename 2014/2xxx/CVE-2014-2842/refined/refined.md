Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2842:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of malformed SSL packets within Juniper ScreenOS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core weakness is the lack of robust input validation for SSL packets within the ScreenOS software. Specifically, the software fails to correctly process malformed SSL packets, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. An attacker can cause the affected Juniper ScreenOS firewall to become unresponsive and unavailable by repeatedly sending malformed SSL/TLS packets.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote and unauthenticated. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability over a network without any prior authentication or privileged access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted Juniper ScreenOS device. No specific attacker position or elevated privileges are required besides network access to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Juniper ScreenOS 6.3 and possibly earlier versions.
- The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the appropriate patches for specific ScreenOS devices as outlined in Juniper security advisory JSA10624.
- A workaround for this issue, prior to patching, is to disable WebUI (SSL) and WebAuth (SSL). This is recommended even on internal networks to fully prevent exploitation.
- Disabling the SSL WebUI (HTTPS) is a security best practice, according to Juniper.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by David Klein of DHK Enterprises.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 7.8.
