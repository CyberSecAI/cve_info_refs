- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `red2301.html` page's `RedirectUrl` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary script in the context of the end-user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a crafted URL, specifically exploiting the `RedirectUrl` parameter in `red2301.html`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes malicious script in the `RedirectUrl` parameter. They do not need to be authenticated.
