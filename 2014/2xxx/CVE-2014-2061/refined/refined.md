Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2061:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The password input control in the password parameter definition within the Jenkins UI was serving the actual, unencrypted password value directly in the HTML source code, instead of an encrypted or masked representation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: The primary vulnerability was the leakage of the default password value in plain text within the HTML.
- Insecure default value handling: When a default value was set for a password parameter, it was not being encrypted and was directly rendered in the HTML.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker who has access to the rendered HTML of a Jenkins job configuration page could potentially view the plain-text password if it was set as the default value for a `PasswordParameterDefinition`.
- Unauthorized access: If a default password was used in multiple locations or for critical functions, its exposure could facilitate further unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct access to Jenkins UI: The vulnerability could be exploited by anyone with access to the Jenkins job configuration pages in the UI. This may include users with limited access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins UI and the specific job configuration page that uses the vulnerable password parameter definition.
- No special privileges are required to trigger this.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves ensuring the password parameter default value is handled as a `Secret` object, which stores the value in an encrypted form.
- The vulnerability is classified as "low" severity due to its limited impact, affecting only a small part of Jenkins and having a less critical outcome.
- The provided commit diff shows changes in `PasswordParameterDefinition.java` to handle default values as `Secret` objects and in `config.jelly` to render default values as an encrypted value.
- Additional test code was added to verify that default values are kept secret after a roundtrip.
