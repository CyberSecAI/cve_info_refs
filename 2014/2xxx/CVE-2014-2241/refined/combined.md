# USN-2148-1: FreeType vulnerabilities

17 March 2014

FreeType could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened
a specially crafted font file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [freetype](/security/cves?package=freetype) - FreeType 2 is a font engine library

## Details

Mateusz Jurczyk discovered that FreeType did not correctly handle certain

malformed font files. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted

font file, a remote attacker could cause FreeType to crash or possibly

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-2240](/security/CVE-2014-2240), [CVE-2014-2241](/security/CVE-2014-2241))

  -
  [2.4.12-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/freetype/2.4.12-0ubuntu1.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make all

the necessary changes.

Yes, those are the correct references for those two CVEs. We are not
sure why "Two stack-based issues" was in the Subject line.
CVE-2014-2241 is a reachable assertion (CWE-617) not a stack-based
buffer overflow (CWE-121).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Mon 10 Mar 2014 09:20:40 AM UTC, comment #8:](#comment8)   Update: you can use CVE-2014-2240 as the identifier of the vulnerability.   You can also use CVE-2014-2241 for the other fix you submitted in relation to this bug, if required (not necessary).   Thanks,  Mateusz | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Sat 01 Mar 2014 02:24:56 AM UTC, comment #7:](#comment7)   Thanks for the quick turn-around!   There isn't a CVE available yet; MITRE can only assign them based on public information, such as the recently submitted commit.   I am going to request one and get back to you once the allocation is made. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 08:30:39 AM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6)   Thanks a lot for the patches!  They are now in the git repository.  Right now I'm preparing a new release, to be available in one or two days, I guess.   Is there a CVE number already available? | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 02:00:53 AM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5)   The problem is triggered by a charstring with too many stem hints.   In the original font, asan\_stack-oob\_704686\_9216\_cov\_3502053733\_sigsegv2.ttf,  the problem occurs with glyph 15364. There are 150 stem hints.  Many incidental errors also occur:  "cff\_index\_access\_element: offset to next entry ..."  "tt\_face\_build\_cmaps: unsupported cmap sub-table ..."   In the second font, ftbench\_oob\_stack\_sigsegv.otf, there are 1,000,000 stem hints in glyph 47.   The error is correctly detected, but the program flow after the error is incorrect. The simplest fix is to return early from cf2\_hintmap\_build() when there is an invalid hint mask. | [Dave Arnold <darnold>](/users/darnold) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 05:33:18 PM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4)   Thanks, it now crashes properly :-) | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 05:06:52 PM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3)   Yes, I am pretty sure that's the right font. It's strange you have difficulty reproducing it, as the bitCount variable is clearly larger than the maximum legal value of 96 in the source code I referred to.   Anyway, here: <http://j00ru.vexillium.org/dump/ftbench_oob_stack_sigsegv.otf> you can find another font which crosses the stack buffer boundary not by just a few bits, but enough to reach the top of the stack and generate a SIGSEGV exception in a regular ftbench build:   --- cut ---  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  820       if ( maskByte & \*maskPtr )  (gdb) where  #0  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  #1  0x00007ffff77249bd in cf2\_interpT2CharString (font=0x60e5c0, buf=0x7fffffffd620, callbacks=0x60e628, translation=0x7fffffffd5d0,      doingSeac=0 '\000', curX=0, curY=0, width=0x7fffffffd5cc)      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2intrp.c:1201  #2  0x00007ffff771febe in cf2\_getGlyphOutline (font=0x60e5c0, charstring=0x7fffffffd620, transform=0x7fffffffd650,      glyphWidth=0x7fffffffd64c) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2font.c:461  #3  0x00007ffff77205b1 in cf2\_decoder\_parse\_charstrings (decoder=0x7fffffffd770,      charstring\_base=0x7ffff6604df8 "\024PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001P"..., charstring\_len=3000007) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2ft.c:369  #4  0x00007ffff771d8e9 in cff\_slot\_load (glyph=0x60c9e0, size=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffgload.c:2840  #5  0x00007ffff7716013 in cff\_glyph\_load (cffslot=0x60c9e0, cffsize=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffdrivr.c:185  #6  0x00007ffff76e6659 in FT\_Load\_Glyph (face=0x60a8e0, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/base/ftobjs.c:726  #7  0x0000000000401acb in test\_load (timer=0x7fffffffe0a0, face=0x60a8e0, user\_data=0x0)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:249  #8  0x00000000004019f7 in benchmark (face=0x60a8e0, test=0x7fffffffe0f0, max\_iter=0, max\_time=2)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:216  #9  0x0000000000402fd8 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe270)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:1020  (gdb) x/10i $rip  => 0x7ffff7721bce <cf2\_hintmap\_build+493>: movzbl (%rax),%eax     0x7ffff7721bd1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+496>: and    -0x21(%rbp),%al     0x7ffff7721bd4 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+499>: test   %al,%al     0x7ffff7721bd6 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+501>: je     0x7ffff7721cd9 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+760>     0x7ffff7721bdc <cf2\_hintmap\_build+507>: mov    -0xb8(%rbp),%rax     0x7ffff7721be3 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+514>: mov    0x1c(%rax),%r8d     0x7ffff7721be7 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+518>: mov    -0xd4(%rbp),%edi     0x7ffff7721bed <cf2\_hintmap\_build+524>: mov    -0x30(%rbp),%rcx     0x7ffff7721bf1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+528>: mov    -0x20(%rbp),%rdx     0x7ffff7721bf5 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+532>: mov    -0xc0(%rbp),%rsi  (gdb) x/10wx $rax  0x7ffffffff000: Cannot access memory at address 0x7ffffffff000  --- cut ---   I hope that helps, let me know if you have any luck with reproduction. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 07:31:09 AM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2)   Thanks for the report.  Are you sure this is the right font?  Dave Arnold can't reproduce it (and me neither, but I don't have a 64bit system – however, I get an assertion at a different place, something that should be fixed also).   It would be very helpful if you could play with ftbench's -i option to help us find the triggering glyph index. | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |

| [Tue 25 Feb 2014 08:43:38 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0)   Tested on Ubuntu AMD64 with upstream FreeType2 and FreeType2-demos, reproduced with ./ftbench <file>.   This is a critical vulnerability in the CFF Rasterizer code recently contributed by Adobe, leading to potential arbitrary code execution in the context of the FreeType2 library client. It will require a CVE identifier and most likely a new stable library release.   I would like to ask you to keep the bug private until a new release is out.

Fix Savannah bug #41697, part 2.\* src/cff/cf2ft.c (cf2\_initLocalRegionBuffer,
cf2\_initGlobalRegionBuffer): It is possible for a charstring to call
a subroutine if no subroutines exist. This is an error but should
not trigger an assert. Split the assert to account for this.

| [Mon 10 Mar 2014 09:20:40 AM UTC, comment #8:](#comment8)   Update: you can use CVE-2014-2240 as the identifier of the vulnerability.   You can also use CVE-2014-2241 for the other fix you submitted in relation to this bug, if required (not necessary).   Thanks,  Mateusz | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Sat 01 Mar 2014 02:24:56 AM UTC, comment #7:](#comment7)   Thanks for the quick turn-around!   There isn't a CVE available yet; MITRE can only assign them based on public information, such as the recently submitted commit.   I am going to request one and get back to you once the allocation is made. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 08:30:39 AM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6)   Thanks a lot for the patches!  They are now in the git repository.  Right now I'm preparing a new release, to be available in one or two days, I guess.   Is there a CVE number already available? | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 02:00:53 AM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5)   The problem is triggered by a charstring with too many stem hints.   In the original font, asan\_stack-oob\_704686\_9216\_cov\_3502053733\_sigsegv2.ttf,  the problem occurs with glyph 15364. There are 150 stem hints.  Many incidental errors also occur:  "cff\_index\_access\_element: offset to next entry ..."  "tt\_face\_build\_cmaps: unsupported cmap sub-table ..."   In the second font, ftbench\_oob\_stack\_sigsegv.otf, there are 1,000,000 stem hints in glyph 47.   The error is correctly detected, but the program flow after the error is incorrect. The simplest fix is to return early from cf2\_hintmap\_build() when there is an invalid hint mask. | [Dave Arnold <darnold>](/users/darnold) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 05:33:18 PM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4)   Thanks, it now crashes properly :-) | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |

It's strange you have difficulty reproducing it, as the bitCount variable is clearly larger than the maximum legal value of 96 in the source code I referred to.   Anyway, here: <http://j00ru.vexillium.org/dump/ftbench_oob_stack_sigsegv.otf> you can find another font which crosses the stack buffer boundary not by just a few bits, but enough to reach the top of the stack and generate a SIGSEGV exception in a regular ftbench build:   --- cut ---  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  820       if ( maskByte & \*maskPtr )  (gdb) where  #0  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  #1  0x00007ffff77249bd in cf2\_interpT2CharString (font=0x60e5c0, buf=0x7fffffffd620, callbacks=0x60e628, translation=0x7fffffffd5d0,      doingSeac=0 '\000', curX=0, curY=0, width=0x7fffffffd5cc)      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2intrp.c:1201  #2  0x00007ffff771febe in cf2\_getGlyphOutline (font=0x60e5c0, charstring=0x7fffffffd620, transform=0x7fffffffd650,      glyphWidth=0x7fffffffd64c) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2font.c:461  #3  0x00007ffff77205b1 in cf2\_decoder\_parse\_charstrings (decoder=0x7fffffffd770,      charstring\_base=0x7ffff6604df8 "\024PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001P"..., charstring\_len=3000007) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2ft.c:369  #4  0x00007ffff771d8e9 in cff\_slot\_load (glyph=0x60c9e0, size=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffgload.c:2840  #5  0x00007ffff7716013 in cff\_glyph\_load (cffslot=0x60c9e0, cffsize=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffdrivr.c:185  #6  0x00007ffff76e6659 in FT\_Load\_Glyph (face=0x60a8e0, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/base/ftobjs.c:726  #7  0x0000000000401acb in test\_load (timer=0x7fffffffe0a0, face=0x60a8e0, user\_data=0x0)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:249  #8  0x00000000004019f7 in benchmark (face=0x60a8e0, test=0x7fffffffe0f0, max\_iter=0, max\_time=2)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:216  #9  0x0000000000402fd8 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe270)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:1020  (gdb) x/10i $rip  => 0x7ffff7721bce <cf2\_hintmap\_build+493>: movzbl (%rax),%eax     0x7ffff7721bd1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+496>: and    -0x21(%rbp),%al     0x7ffff7721bd4 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+499>: test   %al,%al     0x7ffff7721bd6 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+501>: je     0x7ffff7721cd9 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+760>     0x7ffff7721bdc <cf2\_hintmap\_build+507>: mov    -0xb8(%rbp),%rax     0x7ffff7721be3 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+514>: mov    0x1c(%rax),%r8d     0x7ffff7721be7 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+518>: mov    -0xd4(%rbp),%edi     0x7ffff7721bed <cf2\_hintmap\_build+524>: mov    -0x30(%rbp),%rcx     0x7ffff7721bf1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+528>: mov    -0x20(%rbp),%rdx     0x7ffff7721bf5 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+532>: mov    -0xc0(%rbp),%rsi  (gdb) x/10wx $rax  0x7ffffffff000: Cannot access memory at address 0x7ffffffff000  --- cut ---   I hope that helps, let me know if you have any luck with reproduction. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 07:31:09 AM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2)   Thanks for the report.  Are you sure this is the right font?  Dave Arnold can't reproduce it (and me neither, but I don't have a 64bit system – however, I get an assertion at a different place, something that should be fixed also).   It would be very helpful if you could play with ftbench's -i option to help us find the triggering glyph index. | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |

| [Tue 25 Feb 2014 08:43:38 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0)   Tested on Ubuntu AMD64 with upstream FreeType2 and FreeType2-demos, reproduced with ./ftbench <file>.   This is a critical vulnerability in the CFF Rasterizer code recently contributed by Adobe, leading to potential arbitrary code execution in the context of the FreeType2 library client. It will require a CVE identifier and most likely a new stable library release.   I would like to ask you to keep the bug private until a new release is out.

| [Mon 10 Mar 2014 09:20:40 AM UTC, comment #8:](#comment8)   Update: you can use CVE-2014-2240 as the identifier of the vulnerability.   You can also use CVE-2014-2241 for the other fix you submitted in relation to this bug, if required (not necessary).   Thanks,  Mateusz | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Sat 01 Mar 2014 02:24:56 AM UTC, comment #7:](#comment7)   Thanks for the quick turn-around!   There isn't a CVE available yet; MITRE can only assign them based on public information, such as the recently submitted commit.   I am going to request one and get back to you once the allocation is made. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 08:30:39 AM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6)   Thanks a lot for the patches!  They are now in the git repository.  Right now I'm preparing a new release, to be available in one or two days, I guess.   Is there a CVE number already available? | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 02:00:53 AM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5)   The problem is triggered by a charstring with too many stem hints.   In the original font, asan\_stack-oob\_704686\_9216\_cov\_3502053733\_sigsegv2.ttf,  the problem occurs with glyph 15364. There are 150 stem hints.  Many incidental errors also occur:  "cff\_index\_access\_element: offset to next entry ..."  "tt\_face\_build\_cmaps: unsupported cmap sub-table ..."   In the second font, ftbench\_oob\_stack\_sigsegv.otf, there are 1,000,000 stem hints in glyph 47.   The error is correctly detected, but the program flow after the error is incorrect. The simplest fix is to return early from cf2\_hintmap\_build() when there is an invalid hint mask. | [Dave Arnold <darnold>](/users/darnold) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 05:33:18 PM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4)   Thanks, it now crashes properly :-) | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |

It's strange you have difficulty reproducing it, as the bitCount variable is clearly larger than the maximum legal value of 96 in the source code I referred to.   Anyway, here: <http://j00ru.vexillium.org/dump/ftbench_oob_stack_sigsegv.otf> you can find another font which crosses the stack buffer boundary not by just a few bits, but enough to reach the top of the stack and generate a SIGSEGV exception in a regular ftbench build:   --- cut ---  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  820       if ( maskByte & \*maskPtr )  (gdb) where  #0  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  #1  0x00007ffff77249bd in cf2\_interpT2CharString (font=0x60e5c0, buf=0x7fffffffd620, callbacks=0x60e628, translation=0x7fffffffd5d0,      doingSeac=0 '\000', curX=0, curY=0, width=0x7fffffffd5cc)      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2intrp.c:1201  #2  0x00007ffff771febe in cf2\_getGlyphOutline (font=0x60e5c0, charstring=0x7fffffffd620, transform=0x7fffffffd650,      glyphWidth=0x7fffffffd64c) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2font.c:461  #3  0x00007ffff77205b1 in cf2\_decoder\_parse\_charstrings (decoder=0x7fffffffd770,      charstring\_base=0x7ffff6604df8 "\024PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001P"..., charstring\_len=3000007) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2ft.c:369  #4  0x00007ffff771d8e9 in cff\_slot\_load (glyph=0x60c9e0, size=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffgload.c:2840  #5  0x00007ffff7716013 in cff\_glyph\_load (cffslot=0x60c9e0, cffsize=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffdrivr.c:185  #6  0x00007ffff76e6659 in FT\_Load\_Glyph (face=0x60a8e0, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/base/ftobjs.c:726  #7  0x0000000000401acb in test\_load (timer=0x7fffffffe0a0, face=0x60a8e0, user\_data=0x0)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:249  #8  0x00000000004019f7 in benchmark (face=0x60a8e0, test=0x7fffffffe0f0, max\_iter=0, max\_time=2)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:216  #9  0x0000000000402fd8 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe270)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:1020  (gdb) x/10i $rip  => 0x7ffff7721bce <cf2\_hintmap\_build+493>: movzbl (%rax),%eax     0x7ffff7721bd1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+496>: and    -0x21(%rbp),%al     0x7ffff7721bd4 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+499>: test   %al,%al     0x7ffff7721bd6 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+501>: je     0x7ffff7721cd9 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+760>     0x7ffff7721bdc <cf2\_hintmap\_build+507>: mov    -0xb8(%rbp),%rax     0x7ffff7721be3 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+514>: mov    0x1c(%rax),%r8d     0x7ffff7721be7 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+518>: mov    -0xd4(%rbp),%edi     0x7ffff7721bed <cf2\_hintmap\_build+524>: mov    -0x30(%rbp),%rcx     0x7ffff7721bf1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+528>: mov    -0x20(%rbp),%rdx     0x7ffff7721bf5 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+532>: mov    -0xc0(%rbp),%rsi  (gdb) x/10wx $rax  0x7ffffffff000: Cannot access memory at address 0x7ffffffff000  --- cut ---   I hope that helps, let me know if you have any luck with reproduction. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 07:31:09 AM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2)   Thanks for the report.  Are you sure this is the right font?  Dave Arnold can't reproduce it (and me neither, but I don't have a 64bit system – however, I get an assertion at a different place, something that should be fixed also).   It would be very helpful if you could play with ftbench's -i option to help us find the triggering glyph index. | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |

| [Tue 25 Feb 2014 08:43:38 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0)   Tested on Ubuntu AMD64 with upstream FreeType2 and FreeType2-demos, reproduced with ./ftbench <file>.   This is a critical vulnerability in the CFF Rasterizer code recently contributed by Adobe, leading to potential arbitrary code execution in the context of the FreeType2 library client. It will require a CVE identifier and most likely a new stable library release.   I would like to ask you to keep the bug private until a new release is out.
