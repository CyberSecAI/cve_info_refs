      "text": "This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and twenty-five privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user.\n\nThe security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, and by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.\n\n\nMultiple memory corruption vulnerabilities exist when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. These vulnerabilities could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n\n\n| CVE number | Vulnerability Title | Internet Explorer 6 | Internet Explorer 7 | Internet Explorer 8 | Internet Explorer 9 | Internet Explorer 10 | Internet Explorer 11 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CVE-2014-2823 | Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability | Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable | Not applicable | Windows Clients:\\ Critical / RCE\\ \\ Windows Servers:\\ **Moderate / RCE** |\n\n\nIn a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer, and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website, or by getting them to open an attachment sent through email.\n\nAn attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the current user.\n\nThe update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory."
