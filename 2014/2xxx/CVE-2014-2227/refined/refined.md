  "response": {
    "CVE-2014-2227": {
      "status": "RELEVANT",
      "details": {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to an overly permissive default `crossdomain.xml` file in Ubiquiti Networks AirVision application.",
        "Weaknesses": "The `crossdomain.xml` file allows any domain to access resources of the AirVision application, bypassing the Same-Origin Policy. This overly permissive configuration enables Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks and allows for unauthorized data exfiltration.",
        "Impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of an authenticated user, such as adding new administrator accounts or exfiltrating sensitive information like logs. The attacker can also read data from the AirVision Controller.",
        "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves socially engineering a logged-in AirVision administrator to visit a malicious website hosting a specially crafted SWF file. The SWF file then makes requests to the AirVision controller on behalf of the victim, bypassing the same origin policy due to the vulnerable crossdomain.xml.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious SWF file on a server, and socially engineer a logged-in AirVision administrator to view the SWF file. The attacker does not need prior authentication with the AirVision controller."
