Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Drupal's form API handles caching for anonymous users. When pages with forms are cached, the form state associated with one anonymous user can inadvertently leak to other anonymous users interacting with the same form concurrently.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the improper handling of form states in cached pages, leading to information leakage between anonymous users.
- **Form State Leakage:** Specifically, the form's interim input data can be exposed to other users who are viewing the same cached page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The most significant impact is the potential exposure of sensitive or private information that one user may have entered into the form to other anonymous users. The precise data exposed depends on the nature of the form.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Form Interaction:** The attack vector is through users interacting with cached pages containing forms.
- **Concurrent Access:** The vulnerability is triggered when multiple anonymous users access the same cached form concurrently.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Special Privileges:** An attacker need not have any special privileges; being an anonymous user is enough.
- **Concurrent User:** The attacker needs to access a cached form while another user is submitting data to that same form.
- **Website Visitor:** The attacker must be a visitor to a website using Drupal with the vulnerable caching behavior.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both Drupal 6 and 7.
- The fix involves API changes to address the form state leakage.
- The issue is described in the upstream Drupal advisory SA-CORE-2014-002.
