# CVE ids for CyaSSL 2.9.4?

---

*From*: Raphael Geissert <geissert () debian org>

```
Hi,

[CC'ing Ivan Fratric and one of the many @wolfssl addresses I found]

CyaSSL 2.9.4 fixes a number of security issues.

```
> ```
> From [3]:
> Issue #1 (Memory  Corruption)
> Issue #2 (Out of bounds read)
> Issue #3 (Dangerous Default Behavior, out of bounds read)
> Issue #4 (NULL pointer dereference)
> Issue #5 (Unknown Critical Certificate Extension Allowed)
>
> ```

```

Have CVE ids been assigned already? if not, could they be assigned?

Thanks in advance.

# CyaSSL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201612-53**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in CyaSSL, the worst of
which may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/cyassl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | revision <= **2.9.4** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

CyaSSL is a small, fast, portable implementation of TLS/SSL for embedded
devices to the cloud.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in CyaSSL. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

An attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the process, cause a Denial of Service condition, or conduct a
man-in-the-middle attack.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Upstream has discontinued the software in favor of wolfSSL. Therefore,
the CyaSSL package has been removed from the Gentoo repository and
current users are advised to unmerge the package.

```
 # emerge --unmerge "net-libs/cyassl"

```

# wolfSSL Security Advisory: April 9, 2014

- [April 11, 2014](https://www.wolfssl.com/wolfssl-security-advisory-april-9-2014/)

**Issue #1 (Memory  Corruption)**
**CVE-ID:**  CVE-2014-2896
**Product:** CyaSSL
**Vendor:** wolfSSL Inc.
**Affected Versions:** CyaSSL 2.9.0 and previous versions
**Vulnerability Type:**  Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

**Description:** The TLS and DTLS implementations in wolfSSL CyaSSL before 2.9.4 lack a buffer length check in DoAlert(), possibly allowing an attacker to set the read index by up to 2 bytes past the length of the input buffer. This could result in memory corruption or a possible out-of-bounds read.

Thanks to Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team for discovering this  bug.

**Issue #2 (Out of bounds read)**
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2014-2897
**Product:** CyaSSL
**Vendor:** wolfSSL Inc.
**Affected Versions:** CyaSSL 2.5.0 – CyaSSL 2.9.0
**Vulnerability Type:** Cryptographic Issues  (CWE-310)

**Description:** The SSL version 3 HMAC calculation does not check the padding length for a verify failure because many implementations get this wrong. But the length should still be checked to prevent an out-of-bounds read.

Thanks to Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team for discovering and reporting this bug.

**Issue #3 (Dangerous Default Behavior, out of bounds read)**
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2014-2898
**Product:** CyaSSL
**Vendor:** wolfSSL Inc.
**Affected Versions:** CyaSSL 2.9.0 and previous versions
**Vulnerability Type:** Unchecked Error Condition (CWE-391)

**Description:** A user who repeatedly calls CyaSSL\_read() without checking the return code can cause an out-of-bound memory access in an error case such as MAC verification failure.

Thanks to Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team for discovering and reporting this bug.

**Issue #4 (NULL pointer dereference)**
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2014-2899
**Product:** CyaSSL
**Vendor:** wolfSSL Inc.
**Affected Versions:** CyaSSL 2.9.0 and previous versions
**Vulnerability Type:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

**Description:** A user requesting the peer certificate in a certificate parsing failure case can cause a NULL-pointer dereference. Likewise, if an SSL client receives a client\_key\_exchange message a NULL-pointer dereference happens if the client does not have the peer’s ephemeral key.

Thanks to Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team for discovering and reporting this bug.

**Issue #5 (Unknown Critical Certificate Extension Allowed)**
**CVE-ID:** CVE-2014-2900
**Product:**  CyaSSL
**Vendor:** wolfSSL Inc.
**Affected Versions:** CyaSSL 2.9.0 and previous versions
**Vulnerability Type:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

**Description:** Certificate validation must fail if unknown critical extensions are present in the certificate. CyaSSL previously accepted certificates with unknown critical extensions by default.

Thanks to Suman Jana and the security researchers at UT Austin and UC Davis for discovering and reporting this bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
