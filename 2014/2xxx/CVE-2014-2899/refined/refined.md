Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2899:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within CyaSSL. This occurs in two specific scenarios:

1.  When a user requests the peer certificate during a certificate parsing failure.
2.  When an SSL client receives a `client_key_exchange` message but does not possess the peer's ephemeral key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is the potential dereference of a NULL pointer, which can lead to a crash.
-   **Improper Input Validation:** The code fails to properly handle cases where the peer certificate is not available or the ephemeral key is missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) condition due to the application crashing.
    
**Attack Vectors:**
-   A malicious actor can trigger the vulnerability by sending a malformed certificate that causes parsing to fail or by sending a `client_key_exchange` message to a client that is not prepared to handle it.
-   This could be exploited in a man-in-the-middle attack scenario.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious TLS/SSL traffic to a vulnerable CyaSSL client or server.
-   They must have the ability to influence the certificate exchange.
-   In case of `client_key_exchange` message the attacker would need to be able to manipulate the traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
-   This vulnerability affects CyaSSL versions 2.9.0 and prior.
-   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team.
-   The fix for this vulnerability was included in CyaSSL 2.9.4.
-   The issue is categorized as "Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)".
