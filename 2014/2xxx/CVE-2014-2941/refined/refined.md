Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The Cobham Sailor 6000 series satellite terminals contain hardcoded credentials used for the Tbus 2 protocol.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The terminals employ static, pre-defined credentials for the Tbus 2 protocol, instead of using secure credential management practices.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can send arbitrary Tbus 2 commands to the affected terminals, potentially disrupting or manipulating their operation.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending unauthorized commands via the Tbus 2 protocol.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to communicate with the affected terminal via the Tbus 2 protocol. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

The document also provides the following information:

*   The vendor claims that Over-The-Air (OTA) commands require user authentication based on specific passwords, but the vulnerability resides in the hardcoded credentials for Tbus 2. They also state that local action on the ship is required before allowing remote Tbus2 commands, introduced in mini-C software release 1.06.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ruben Santamarta.
*   There is no practical solution at the time of writing.
*   The provided CVSS scores are:
    *   Base: 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:N) - Network access, Medium complexity, No authentication required, no confidentiality impact, complete integrity impact, no availability impact.
    *   Temporal: 5.8 (E:POC/RL:U/RC:UC) - Proof-of-concept exploit exists, Remediation level is unavailable, Report confidence is unconfirmed.
    *   Environmental: 1.4 (CDP:N/TD:L/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND) - No collateral damage potential, low target distribution, no confidentiality requirement, no integrity requirement, no availability requirement

This information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, providing specific details about the vulnerable protocol, the vendor's response, and the lack of a current fix.
