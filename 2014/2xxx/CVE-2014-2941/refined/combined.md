## Cobham Sailor 6000 series satellite terminal contain hardcoded credentials

#### Vulnerability Note VU#269991

Original Release Date: 2014-08-07 | Last Revised: 2014-08-14

---

### Overview

Cobham Sailor 6000 series satellite terminals contain hardcoded credentials for communicating via the Tbus 2 protocol.

### Description

| Note: this is a different vulnerability from VU#460687  [**CWE-798**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)**: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**IOActive reports that Cobham Sailor 6000 series satellite communication terminals contain hardcoded credentials to communicate via the Tbus 2 protocol. The Tbus 2 protocol is a maintenance protocol for shipboard communications.The vendor Cobham has provided the following statement:*All Over-The-Air (OTA) commands require user authentication based on specific passwords to the specific terminal. No hard-coded credentials can be used in any case. User authentication is required for each individual command set so there is no possibility to exploit another user’s credentials. Furthermore the security has been enhanced in mini-C software release 1.06 by requiring local action on the ship before allowing remote TBUS2 commands.* *Cobham SATCOM will continue to evaluate any potential vulnerabilities with its equipment and implement increased security measures if required.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker may be able to send arbitrary Tbus 2 commands to the terminal, affecting the operation of the system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
