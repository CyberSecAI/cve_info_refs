```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The Skybox View Appliances' admin interfaces have insufficient access control, allowing unauthenticated access to sensitive information and administrative functions.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - Authentication bypass: The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism and gain access to administrative menus.
    - Information disclosure: The vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain sensitive system information such as interface names, IP addresses, and appliance status.
- Impact of exploitation:
    - Unauthorized access to system information, which could be used for further attacks.
- Attack vectors:
    - Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to specific URLs on the Skybox View appliance's web interface.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - Network access to the vulnerable Skybox View appliance.
