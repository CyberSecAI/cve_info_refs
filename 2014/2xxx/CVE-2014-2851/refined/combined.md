Debian Security Advisory DSA-2926-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : linux
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0196 CVE-2014-1737 CVE-2014-1738 CVE-2014-2851
                 CVE-2014-3122

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation:

CVE-2014-0196

    Jiri Slaby discovered a race condition in the pty layer, which could
    lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-1737 / CVE-2014-1738

    Matthew Daley discovered that missing input sanitising in the
    FDRAWCMD ioctl and an information leak could result in privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2014-2851

    Incorrect reference counting in the ping_init_sock() function allows
    denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2014-3122

    Incorrect locking of memory can result in local denial of service.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.57-3+deb7u1. This update also fixes a regression in the isci
driver and suspend problems with certain AMD CPUs (introduced in the
updated kernel from the Wheezy 7.5 point release).

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1086730#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-04-11 11:50:15 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way ping_init_sock() function handled group_info struct reference counter. Since group_info refcounter is only incremented but never decremented in this codepath, it could lead to refcounter overflow and possibly to use-after-free issue later.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.
