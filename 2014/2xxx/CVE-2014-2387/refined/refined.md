  "CVE-2014-2387": {
    "description": "Pen 0.18.0 has Insecure Temporary File Creation vulnerabilities",
    "affected_component": "pen load balancer",
    "root_cause": "The pen load balancer creates temporary files in an insecure manner.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Insecure use of temporary files when requesting web stats. Specifically, the application creates the 'webfile.html' temporary file in an insecure manner, using the hardcoded path '/tmp/webfile.html'.",
       "Insecure use of temporary files when invoking the penctl command in the supplied CGI script. Specifically, the CGI script uses a hardcoded path of '/tmp/penctl.cgi' to write output to.",
     "When a control-socket is configured a user who can connect to that port can overwrite arbitrary files as the user pen is launched as using the `write` command. Also, arbitrary files can be read via the `include` command and the content printed to the system log."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to manipulate the contents of arbitrary files via symlink attacks, overwrite arbitrary files on the system, and potentially disclose sensitive information by reading files such as `/etc/shadow` via the `include` command.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required to exploit the insecure temporary file creation using symlinks.",
      "Network access to the control socket (if enabled) is required to exploit the arbitrary file overwrite or file disclosure vulnerabilities."
      
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires local access to the system to exploit the insecure temporary file creation, and access to the control socket, if enabled, to exploit the arbitrary file overwrite/disclosure vulnerabilities. The attacker needs to be able to run the vulnerable application.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability was fixed by using more secure methods of creating temporary files, such as using `/var/run/pen.pid-[Port]` instead of hardcoded paths in `/tmp`. The `write` command which could be used for overwriting files is restricted and the control socket is recommended to use unix domain sockets instead of TCP."
