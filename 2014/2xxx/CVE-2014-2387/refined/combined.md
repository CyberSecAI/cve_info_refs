Insecure use of temporary files when requesting      websteats:          } else if (!strcmp(p, "status")) {                 p = webfile;                 webfile = "/tmp/webfile.html";                 webstats();         ...      2.  Insecure use of temporary files when invoking       the penctl command in the supplied CGI script:  PENCTL=penctl ...         $PENCTL $SERVER:$PORT status 2> /tmp/penctl.cgi ..       3.  When a control-socket is configured (via "-C ip:port" added        to the pen command line) a user who can connect to that port        can overwrite arbitrary files as the user pen is launched as:  shelob ~ $ sudo pen 4444 localhost:9000 -C 127.0.0.1:5043 shelob ~ $ penctl 127.0.0.1:5043 write /tmp/meow shelob ~ $ penctl 127.0.0.1:5043 write /etc/owned shelob ~ $ ls -l /etc/owned /tmp/meow -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1187 Mar 11 18:35 /etc/owned -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1186 Mar 11 18:35 /tmp/meow    Please feel free to ask for details if they can be helpful,  versions are unknown, but the current version is v0.18.0  Steve --  <http://www.steve.org.uk/>   References: <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/12351> <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=741370> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=868116#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2014-03-13 23:00:20 UTC  ``` bugbot adjusting priority ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=868116#c2)  Marcus Meissner   2014-03-14 07:23:42 UTC  ``` From: cve-assign@mitre.org  > webfile = "/tmp/webfile.html";  > 2> /tmp/penctl.cgi  Use CVE-2014-2387 for both issues involving files in the /tmp directory.   >     3.

This seems to be an opportunity for security improvement, not a vulnerability. It appears that the design goal was to listen for commands in a way that could be acceptable on a server with sufficiently restricted access, and not acceptable in arbitrary environments. "port where the load balancer listens for commands" seems sufficiently descriptive for a reasonable person to immediately wonder who can send commands. Furthermore, the example in question:    sudo pen 4444 localhost:9000 -C 127.0.0.1:5043  suggests that the person is aware that "a control port" means a TCP port, not some other type of port with obvious permission-based restrictions. A CVE assignment could be made if there were an implementation error (e.g., the user specifies listening on 127.0.0.1 but the code actually listens on all interfaces). A CVE assignment might also be possible for some types of design problems, but they'd need to be considerably more surprising and the documentation would need to be considerably more misleading. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=868116#c3)  Victor Pereira   2015-02-16 09:19:02 UTC  ``` the actual version 0.18, fixed it already. Now the temp files are handled like: /var/run/pen.pid-[Port] ``` |  |

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](#c0)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2014-03-20 13:35:04 UTC  ``` From ${URL} :  Description  Steve Kemp has discovered a security issue in pen, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to  manipulate certain data.  The security issue is caused due to the application creating the "webfile.html" temporary file in an  insecure manner. This can be exploited to manipulate the contents of certain files via symlink attacks.  The security issue is confirmed in version 0.21.1. Other versions may also be affected.   Solution: No official solution is currently available.  Provided and/or discovered by: Steve Kemp  Original Advisory: <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/03/12/14>   @maintainer(s): after the bump, in case we need to stabilize the package, please let us know if it is ready for the stabilization or not. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Michael Palimaka (kensington)   gentoo-dev  2014-10-15 16:39:26 UTC  ``` +  15 Oct 2014; Michael Palimaka <kensington@gentoo.org> +pen-0.25.1.ebuild: +  Version bump wrt [bug #505168](show_bug.cgi?id=505168 "RESOLVED FIXED - <net-misc/pen-0.25.1: \"webfile.html\" Insecure Temporary File Security Issue").

```
Package: pen
Version: 0.18.0-1
Severity: minor
Tags: security

There are four issues to report here;

1.  Predictable filename in pen itself.
2.  Insecure temporary filename in the contributed CGI script.
3.  File overwrite / disclosure issues in pen.
4.  Information disclosure.

Predictable filename in pen itself
-----------------------------------

When pen is instructed to dump statistics it will use the name
/tmp/webfile.html by default.

This is not a major concern given that it is created owned by
the attacker:

shelob ~ $ sudo pen 4444 localhost:9000 -C 127.0.0.1:5043
shelob ~ $ penctl 127.0.0.1:5043 statistics
shelob ~ $ ls -l /tmp/webfile.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 skx skx 3746 Mar 11 18:28 /tmp/webfile.html

Insecure temporary filename in the contributed CGI script
-------------------------------------------------------

The file /usr/share/doc/pen/penctl.cgi contains this horrible
content:

        $PENCTL $SERVER:$PORT status 2> /tmp/penctl.cgi

Symlinks are followed, providing the webserve has permission to
write to the file...

File overwrite / disclosure issues in pen
------------------------------------------

Assuming the server is started with a control-socket open then
a user who can contact that socket can create arbitrary files
upon the system:

shelob ~ $ sudo pen 4444 localhost:9000 -C 127.0.0.1:5043
shelob ~ $ penctl 127.0.0.1:5043 write /tmp/meow
shelob ~ $ penctl 127.0.0.1:5043 write /etc/owned
shelob ~ $ ls -l /etc/owned /tmp/meow
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1187 Mar 11 18:35 /etc/owned
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1186 Mar 11 18:35 /tmp/meow

The files are created as the user who started pen, root in this case,
and although they are not writeable they allow arbitrary overwrites
to occur.

Information Disclosure
-----------------------

Again, assuming a control socket was created, invalid commands
are echoed to syslog.

Assuming a local user is member of group `adm` they can read
/etc/shadow indirectly:

shelob ~ $ sudo pen 4444 localhost:9000 -C 127.0.0.1:5043
shelob ~ $ penctl 127.0.0.1:5043 include /etc/shadow

(NOTE The file is read by the user the server is lauched as,
in this case root.)

Now because we're member of the 'adm' group we can read the
lines that were ignored by pen:

Mar 11 18:30:00 shelob pen: do_cmd: ignoring command starting with 'root:$6$zwJQWKVo$ofoV2xw0/Wg.rwXXitSyS8/SUUK3PRGp54Sd0VunhVl6W6ekVJlSW8vlqjrdsdwaT58L6Qoosx8IrKsdfsdf5Mxo/:15884:0:99999:7:::'

Mitigating factors?  There is no init-script which is supplied
in the debian package, however equally there is no documentation
implying that using a control-socket is dangerous.

I will add the user and provide a proper init script in the next
upload. However, I don't think that this fixes the core issues
reported. A user can still choose to run pen in another way and should
be protected by such issues.

The core issue being that it is possible to run pen with remote control
from untrusted hosts (or any host), should the administrator so desire.

I don't think it is possible to prevent active misconfiguration reliably
(e.g. Apache can trivially be configured to serve /etc/shadow to the
world). What could be done however is some combination of:

1. Refuse to open the control socket running as root.

2. Use a default, built in access list for the control socket which
denies from everywhere. The administrator can change the acl, but that
would be an active choice.

Finally, the CGI script is not installed by make install and I don't
think there is a good reason to distribute it.

  Agreed.  I did think of limiting the control-socket to 127.0.0.1:XX
 but that a) reduces flexibility and b) still isn't sufficient to
 prevent a local user to run commands.

  To my mind there are two issues here:

  1.  Anybody that can connect to the control socket can do "things".

  2.  The are "things" that can be done which result in potential
     security problems.

  The ideal solution would be to require password authentication
 in addition to the socket connectivity.  This would let you,
 potentially, run with a control-socket wide open, but still restrict
 malicious connections.

  (Obviously from localhost you'd want to have a password in an
 unreadable file, to avoid it from being read via vi, or similar.)

  The second problem of allowing file overwrites via the "write"
 primitive could be solved via chrooting, dropping privileges to
 nobody, or disabling the primitive unless it appears in the config
 file.

  I'm not sure how generally useful all the primitives are, but I could
 see the case for only allowing some primitives to work from a config
 file and not interactively.  Similarly I could see dropping privileges
 from root to "pen" and chrooting to "/var/run/pen" would avoid any
 file overwrites from happening - because the deamon would simply not
 have the permission to do so.

  As you say the .CGI script is perhaps best avoided, but the
 documentation should certainly mention potential concerns with
 the use of a control socket.

  I've requested CVE IDs for the various issues, and will update
 if/when I receive them.

The control socket and the configuration file use the exact same syntax
by design. If it is impossible or impractical to limit access to the
socket, the same level of control over a running Pen can be accomplished
from localhost by editing the config and an old-fashioned HUP.

A password would imply that the protocol is safe, which it obviously
isn't - it is plain text over tcp.

A Unix-domain control socket is a trivial change which wouldn't break
anything but allow much more fine-grained control over who has access
from localhost. A brilliant idea which I congratulate myself on.

  While this is true, and people are free to run things as they
 wish, I've been assuming a root-owned configuration file & init
 script.  So an unprivileged local user wouldn't be able to either
 reload or edit the config.

  I don't see the connection there.  You might express it in
 reverse "Because the control socket allows 'unsafe things' a
 password proves you have legitimate reason to talk to/with it."

  Actually that didn't occur to me, but as you say it is a lovely
 solution.  Root could start the deamon with the socket having
 mode 600 and local users wouldn't be able to do bad things with it,
 similarly a local user could have ~/.pen.sock and they'd be safe
 against other local users - but not root, of course.

  Use a domain-socket and I think things become much tighter.
 Great idea!

```
```

I just released 0.22.0, hoping noone will think it is a joke.

This release has one new feature, the Unix domain listening sockets
suggested above.

The hard-coded path for the web stats has been removed, so the status
command now simply fails unless a path has been explicitly specified.

Pen is now reluctant to open the control socket running as root. A user
who really, really wants to can still do that, but has to jump through
more hoops. This behaviour, as well as what the control socket does, is
documented in the pen man page.

Finally, the cgi script has been "updated" to just print an error
message and exit. If Debian continue to distribute it, it should be
harmless in this form.

Description:
 pen        - Load balancer for "simple" tcp based protocols
Closes: [741370](bugreport.cgi?bug=741370)
Changes:
 pen (0.22.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium
 .
   * New upstream release.
      + No more hard-coded path for statistics.
      + Control socket can now be an Unix socket. Moreover, pen will be
        reluctant to use it as root. This is documented in the manpage. The
        user is therefore expected to know what he is doing when using this
        feature.
   * Don't ship the CGI script, even as an example. It is outdated and
     insecure.
   * The three above items fix CVE-2014-237. Closes: #[741370](bugreport.cgi?bug=741370).
   * Update manpage patch.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1076049#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-13 12:37:24 UTC  ``` Steve Kemp reported two temporary file issues in pen, a load balancer for "simple" TCP based protocols such as HTTP and SMTP.  The first is the use of "/tmp/webfile.html" when requesting web stats.  The second is the use of "/tmp/penctl.cgi" in the penctl.cgi CGI script.  A local attacker could use these flaws to perform symbolic link attacks.

Use CVE-2014-2387 for both issues involving files in the /tmp directory.

This seems to be an opportunity for security improvement, not a
vulnerability. It appears that the design goal was to listen for
commands in a way that could be acceptable on a server with
sufficiently restricted access, and not acceptable in arbitrary
environments. "port where the load balancer listens for commands" seems
sufficiently descriptive for a reasonable person to immediately wonder
who can send commands. Furthermore, the example in question:

  sudo pen 4444 localhost:9000 -C 127.0.0.1:5043

suggests that the person is aware that "a control port" means a TCP
port, not some other type of port with obvious permission-based
restrictions. A CVE assignment could be made if there were an
implementation error (e.g., the user specifies listening on 127.0.0.1
but the code actually listens on all interfaces). A CVE assignment
might also be possible for some types of design problems, but they'd
need to be considerably more surprising and the documentation would
need to be considerably more misleading.
