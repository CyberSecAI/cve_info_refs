| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software Crafted IPv6 Packet Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20140326-ipv6  First Published: 2014 March 26 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCui59540](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui59540)     CVE-2014-2113     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2014-2113     CWE-20       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-ipv6/oval/cisco-sa-20140326-ipv6_481.xml)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the implementation of the IP version 6 (IPv6) protocol stack in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause I/O memory depletion on an affected device that has IPv6 enabled. The vulnerability is triggered when an affected device processes a malformed IPv6 packet.  Affected Products  * This vulnerability affects Cisco devices running an affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release and have IPv6 enabled. IPv6 is not enabled by default in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software.   Vulnerable ProductsA Cisco device running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release and has IPv6 enabled will show interfaces with assigned IPv6 addresses when the **show ipv6 interface brief** command is issued.      The **show ipv6 interface brief** command will produce an error message if the running version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software release does not support IPv6, or will not show any interfaces with IPv6 addresses if IPv6 is disabled. The system is not vulnerable in either scenario.      The following example shows the output from the **show ipv6 interface brief** command issued on a device running Cisco IOS Software enabled for IPv6: ```   router>show ipv6 interface brief    FastEthernet0/0            [up/up]       FE80::222:90FF:FEB0:1098       2001:DB8:2:93::3       200A:1::1   FastEthernet0/1            [up/up]       FE80::222:90FF:FEB0:1099       2001:DB8:2:94::1   Serial0/0/0                [down/down]       unassigned   Serial0/0/0.4              [down/down]       unassigned   Serial0/0/0.5              [down/down]       unassigned   Serial0/0/0.6              [down/down]       unassigned   ``` The IPv6 protocol is enabled if the interface configuration command **ipv6 address**  or **ipv6 enable** is present in the configuration; however, both may be present. The following examples shows a vulnerable configuration with both present: ```   interface FastEthernet0/1    ipv6 address 2001:0DB8:C18:1::/64 eui-64   !   interface FastEthernet0/2    ipv6 enable   ``` A device running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software with IPv6 enabled on a physical or logical interface is vulnerable even if **ipv6 unicast-routing** is globally disabled (that is, the device is not routing IPv6 packets).    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco ASA SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Designed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), IPv6 is intended to replace the current IP version (IPv4).      A vulnerability in the implementation of the IPv6 protocol stack in Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause I/O memory depletion on the affected device.      The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of crafted IPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger I/O memory depletion, causing device instability and could cause a device to reload.      This vulnerability has been documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCui59540](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCui59540) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2113      The vulnerability is triggered when an affected device processes a malformed IPv6 packet. Transit IPv6 traffic will not trigger this vulnerability.      Identification of potentially hitting this vulnerability would be via small amounts of I/O memory being available as shown in the following example via the **show memory summary** CLI command: ```   Router#show memory summary                Head    Total(b)     Used(b)     Free(b)   Lowest(b)  Largest(b)Processor   128C7B50   759290240   249009244   510280996   504250376   510241908      I/O   3C400000    62914560    62912692        1868        1868         236   ``` Memory will be held by the **Pool Manager** process as shown in the following example via the **show memory debug leaks chunks** command: ```   Router#show memory debug leaks chunksAdding blocks for GD...                 I/O memory                 Address    Size   Alloc_pc  PID  Alloc-Proc       NameChunk Elements:AllocPC  Address  Size  Parent   Name                 Processor memory                 Address    Size   Alloc_pc  PID  Alloc-Proc       Name 1020A20     1244  430FAC8  7    Pool Manager    *Packet Header* 102226C     1244  430FAC8  7    Pool Manager    *Packet Header* 1022C24     1244  430FAC8  7    Pool Manager    *Packet Header* 1023100     1244  430FAC8  7    Pool Manager    *Packet Header* 10235DC     1244  430FAC8  7    Pool Manager    *Packet Header* 1023AB8     1244  430FAC8  7    Pool Manager    *Packet Header* 102494C     1244  430FAC8  7    Pool Manager    *Packet Header*   ``` A reload of the device is required to release the memory. Disabling IPv6 by removing the IPv6 configuration will not release the memory.  Workarounds  * If IPv6 configuration is required, there are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.        In February 2014, Cisco announced details of an industry-wide issue with memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. Although the majority of Cisco products that use these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, a device reload or power cycle could expose component failures. While there are no known security implications associated with this issue, a subset of the affected products may experience a memory component failure during the software upgrade process. Cisco recommends customers review the related information and product-specific field notices at [www.cisco.com/go/memory](http://www.cisco.com/go/memory) before making upgrade decisions. Each Field Notice indicates whether the product could experience the memory component failure during a software upgrade. Cisco IOS Software The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) is the quickest method to determine exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The tool allows customers to quickly identify Cisco Security Advisories that impact specific Cisco IOS Software releases. Users can initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from their local system. The tool is also capable of parsing **show version** command output. Results can be customized by searching against all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all the advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication.       Customers can also use the Cisco IOS Software tables below to determine their exposure. Each row corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software release; if a particular release is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the second column. The third column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication.       **Expand to View Detailed Fixed Software Information**      | **Major Release** | **Availability of Repaired Releases** | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected 12.X-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.X based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.0-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 15.0 based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.1-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | 15.1EY | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable;
