Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the incorrect processing of crafted IPv6 packets within the IPv6 protocol stack implementation of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate or handle malformed IPv6 packets.
- **Memory Depletion:** The crafted packets cause excessive I/O memory allocation, leading to memory exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in I/O memory depletion.
- **Device Instability:** The memory depletion leads to device instability.
- **Device Reload:** In severe cases, the device may reload, causing service interruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted IPv6 packets to the affected device.
- **Malformed IPv6 Packets:** The attack involves sending specially crafted IPv6 packets to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Transit IPv6 Traffic:** It is noted that transit IPv6 traffic will not trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker can be remote from the target device.
- **Unauthenticated:** No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to send the crafted IPv6 packets to the affected device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered only if the device has IPv6 enabled.
- Disabling IPv6 after the attack does not release the depleted memory, a device reload is required for that.
- The vulnerability is identified by Cisco bug ID CSCui59540.
- The content provides a CVSS v2 score of 7.8 (Base) and 6.4 (Temporal).
- The advisory provides extensive information about affected software versions and fixed releases for both Cisco IOS and IOS XE software.
