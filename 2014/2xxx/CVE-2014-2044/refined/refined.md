Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2044
*   **Vulnerable Software:** ownCloud
*   **Affected Versions:** 4.0.x & 4.5.x
*   **Fixed Version:** 5.0
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass internal blacklists using Windows Alternate Data Streams (ADS). This allows an authenticated user to create a custom `.htaccess` file within their user folder on a Windows server. This malicious `.htaccess` file enables PHP execution within that directory.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Bypassed Blacklist:**  The application fails to properly sanitize file uploads, allowing the attacker to inject a malicious file (.htaccess) by using Windows ADS.
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files, including those that can be used to modify server behavior, like .htaccess.
    *   **PHP execution:** The server allows PHP files to be executed based on the presence of the .htaccess file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
    *   **Full Server Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution can lead to a full compromise of the server and associated infrastructure.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:** Attackers upload a specially crafted `.htaccess` file using the file upload functionality.
    *   **Windows ADS:** Windows Alternate Data Streams are used to bypass file upload restrictions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to access the file upload functionality.
    *   **Target on Windows:** The vulnerability only affects Windows versions of ownCloud.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by uploading a file with a filename like `.htaccess::$DATA`. This is how Windows ADS is used to bypass the file extension filter/blacklist.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to craft the HTTP request for uploading the malicious `.htaccess` file.

This information provides significantly more detail compared to the typical CVE description, highlighting the specific attack vector (Windows ADS) and the resulting arbitrary code execution.
