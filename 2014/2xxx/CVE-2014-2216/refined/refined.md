The provided document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting FortiNet FortiGate and FortiWiFi appliances. This response focuses on the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2216.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The FortiManager service running on TCP port 541 uses a protocol where space for eight argument pointers is allocated on the heap. However, the parsing logic accepts an arbitrary number of argument pointers, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote, unprivileged attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the appliance.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted message to the FortiManager service, which is accessible remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable FortiManager service on TCP port 541.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
