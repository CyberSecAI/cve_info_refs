{
  "CVE-2014-2285": {
    "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "Root cause": "A flaw in the way the snmptrapd service handled SNMP trap requests with an empty community string when the Perl handler was enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of null values when processing SNMP traps with empty community strings.",
      "Vulnerability in Perl's `newSVpv()` function, which crashes if the first argument is NULL."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by crashing snmptrapd.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a specially crafted SNMP trap request with an empty community string to a vulnerable snmptrapd service with the perl handler enabled."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to send SNMP trap requests to the target system.",
      "Remote network access"
    ],
    "Additional Information": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered only when the Perl handler for snmptrapd is enabled.",
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later versions were not vulnerable due to a fix in Perl's `newSVpv()` function.",
       "The issue was caused by a bug in perl where the `newSVpv()` function didn't handle NULL values correctly",
      "The perl version shipped in RHEL5 crashed when `newSVpv()` was called with a NULL argument.",
      "The perl version shipped in RHEL6 handles NULL values gracefully.",
        "The upstream fix addressed the issue with the newSVpv function."
