## Vulnerability in Microsoft Service Bus Could Allow Denial of Service (2972621)

Published: July 8, 2014 | Updated: October 14, 2014

**Version:** 2.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Service Bus for Windows Server. The vulnerability could allow denial of service if a remote authenticated attacker creates and runs a program that sends a sequence of specially crafted Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) messages to the target system. Microsoft Service Bus for Windows Server is not shipped with any Microsoft operating system. For an affected system to be vulnerable Microsoft Service Bus must first be downloaded, installed, and configured, and then its configuration details (farm certificate) shared with other users.

This security update is rated Moderate for Microsoft Service Bus 1.1 when installed on affected editions of Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Service Bus for Windows Server handles AMQP messages. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the Affected Software table later in this bulletin.

For additional guidance, see the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** section in this bulletin.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-2814](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-2814).

### Mitigating Factors

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* Microsoft Service Bus for Windows Server is not shipped with any Microsoft operating system. For an affected system to be vulnerable Microsoft Service Bus must first be downloaded, installed, and configured, and then its configuration details (farm certificate) shared with other users.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

**Disable AMQP**

If you do not need AMQP protocol functionality and connectivity, you can disable AMQP usage. To disable AMQP, follow these steps:

1. Open the GatewayComponents.config file located in the c:\Program Files\Service Bus\1.1\ directory. (Save a back-up of this file to restore later should you want to undo this workaround.)
2. Remove all references to the "AmqpProtocolHead" component and save the file.
3. In order for the change to take effect, execute the following Service Bus PowerShell cmdlets:

   ```
    stop-sbhost

   ```

   followed by

   ```
    start-sbhost

   ```

   **Note** If more than one node exists in the configured service bus farm, then the preceding steps must be undertaken on each node in the farm.

**Impact of workaround.** No AMQP connections will be accepted.

**How to undo the workaround.**

To undo the workaround, follow these steps:

1. Restore your backup of the GatewayComponents.config file to the c:\Program Files\Service Bus\1.1\ directory.
2. In order for the change to take effect, execute the following Service Bus PowerShell cmdlets:

   ```
    stop-sbhost

   ```

   followed by

   ```
    start-sbhost

   ```

   **Note** If more than one node exists in the configured service bus farm, then the preceding steps must be undertaken on each node in the farm.
