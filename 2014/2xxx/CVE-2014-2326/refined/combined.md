How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi Moritz,

Thanks for the heads up, but that link is rather unclear and talks about
an old version of cacti. How is e.g. [CVE-2014-2326](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2326) different than (the
already fixed) [CVE-2013-5588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5588), [CVE-2010-2545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2545), [CVE-2010-2544](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2544) and
[CVE-2010-2543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2543)?

And is [CVE-2014-2328](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2328) not the same as [CVE-2009-4112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4112)?

I see [CVE-2014-2327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2327) as being new though.

Paul

Oh, do you know if this is communicated upstream? I didn't see this on
the cacti list and don't see it in the bug tracker.

I don't know, I only saw the announcement from Telekom CERT on bugtraq.
Maybe contact them at cert@telekom.de for more information.

Hi,

As the maintainer of Cacti in Debian, I received [1] your security
report [2] on Cacti yesterday. I have several questions.

I didn't see any public communication with the upstream maintainers, so
I assume it was done in private. After releasing your CVE numbers,
wouldn't it been nice to report the issues also in the bug tracker of
cacti, so that contributors could maybe help?

I find your report rather vague, for one because it talks about
an old version of cacti (current version is 0.8.8b). How is e.g.
[CVE-2014-2326](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2326) different than (the already fixed) [CVE-2013-5588](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5588),
[CVE-2010-2545](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2545), [CVE-2010-2544](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2544) and [CVE-2010-2543](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2543)? Could you please explain
if you found new issues? Maybe just explicitly stating the issues you found?

Furthermore, with the current description I hardly see a difference
between [CVE-2014-2328](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2328) and the (unresolved) [CVE-2009-4112](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4112)?

To me it seems you have a new point with [CVE-2014-2327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2327) though.

Paul Gevers.

Paul,

I created 3 bugs to fix the issues outlined.  I'm still working on
[CVE-2014-2327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2327) as it will require a little more work to mitigate in the
Cacti code.  As for your questions about past CVE, the currently
reported ones are valid from the reported version to the latest.  Once I
have resolved the issue in [CVE-2014-2327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2327), I will post patches all the
way back to 0.8.7g to 0.8.8b.  A new release is pending release after
testing is complete.

If you are logged into the bug system you should be able to read the
descriptions of the issues that I added as private comments.

Hi Tony,

Just for your heads up. I was hoping to also se a fix for [CVE-2014-2327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2327)
already, but I fully understand why that takes longer. Do you have any
idea how long it will take? Days, weeks, months? If the scale is bigger
than some small number of weeks, I will patch cacti in Debian already
with the fixes available.

You do know that Cacti got assigned two other CVE's for a fix you made
recently? [CVE-2014-2708](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2708) and [CVE-2014-2709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2709):

Subject: Re: Regarding your cacti security report CVE-2014-2326 - 2328
Date: Fri, 04 Apr 2014 22:05:46 -0400
```
Paul,

[CVE-2014-2708](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2708) and [CVE-2014-2709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2709) are address in
<http://bugs.cacti.net/view.php?id=2405>

Security patch for the following has been posted on the Cacti site for
versions 0.8.7g to 0.8.8b:

- [CVE-2014-2326](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2326) Unspecified HTML Injection Vulnerability
- [CVE-2014-2328](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2328) Unspecified Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
- [CVE-2014-2708](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2708) Unspecified SQL Injection Vulnerability
- [CVE-2014-2709](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2709) Unspecified Remote Command Execution Vulnerability

As for [CVE-2014-2327](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2327) Cross Site Request Forgery Vulnerability, I'm still
working on a solution.  I have some limited time this weekend to work on
this fix.  But I will be on the west coast for business this next week
and will have time at night to work on this fix.  I plan on pushing
0.8.8c release to address this and other minor fixes in Cacti the
weekend of April 12th.

Tony
