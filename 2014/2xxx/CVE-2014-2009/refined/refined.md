Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Mpay24 plugin, by default, logs raw cURL requests and debugging information to a publicly accessible log file. This is due to debug mode being enabled by default in versions 1.5 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information, such as base64 encoded API credentials, is logged in a publicly accessible file.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** Debug mode, which produces sensitive logs, is enabled by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **API Credential Hijacking:** An attacker can obtain Mpay24 API credentials, potentially allowing them to take over the merchant's API access.
*   **Path Disclosure:** The log file reveals the local path of the Prestashop installation. This can be used to leverage other exploits on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct File Access:** An attacker can access the publicly available log file via a web browser. The specific URL pattern is: `http://target/path/modulesmapy24/api/curllog.log`
*   **No Authentication Required:** The log file is accessible without any authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the target web server.
*   **Knowledge of File Location:** The attacker must know or be able to guess the location of the log file on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Mpay24 Payment Module version 1.5 and earlier.
*   The recommended fix is to update to version 1.6 or later, where the debug logging is no longer enabled by default.
*   The advisory mentions that the vendor was notified on 10/02/2014, a patch was available through GitHub on 13/02/2014, and the CVE was assigned on 19/02/2014
