Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2020:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents contain information directly related to CVE-2014-2020. The Ubuntu security notice (USN-2126-1) explicitly mentions that a vulnerability related to the `imagecrop` function in PHP was addressed and includes CVE-2014-2020 in the list of related CVEs. The PHP bug report #66356 further elaborates on the `imagecrop` vulnerabilities including the conditions related to CVE-2013-7226, CVE-2013-7327, CVE-2013-7328 and CVE-2014-2020. 

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the insufficient validation of user-supplied dimensions (x, y, width, height) when using the `imagecrop` function. This lack of validation leads to multiple issues:
    - **Type confusion:** The code doesn't properly check the type of the values provided for x,y,width and height and directly uses them as integers, even if they are strings or arrays. This allows information leaks as string and array zvals may contain pointers.
    - **Missing NULL pointer checks:** The `gdImageCreateTrueColor()` and `gdImageCreate()` functions can return NULL on failure due to invalid dimensions, but this return is not checked and the returned NULL pointer is later dereferenced.
    - **Integer overflows:** Signed integer arithmetic is used for bounds checks, making it possible to bypass the checks by supplying large values, resulting in heap overflows when `memcpy` is called.
    - **Out-of-bounds reads:** Negative `x` and `y` values are not properly handled, causing the `memcpy` function to read outside of the source image's pixel data.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Type Confusion:** Improper handling of zval types when reading dimensions for image cropping.
- **Heap Overflow:** Incorrect bounds checking in `imagecrop` allows copying data beyond allocated buffer size.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Failure to check return values of image creation functions which can result in dereferencing a NULL pointer.
- **Out-of-bounds read:** Copying pixels outside the source image bounds, by providing negative x or y values.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to application crashes due to NULL pointer dereferences, segmentation faults and heap overflows.
- **Information Leak:**  By passing strings or arrays as coordinates to the `imagecrop` function, an attacker could potentially leak memory addresses.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated, the heap overflow vulnerability has the potential to be further exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, however it's only "possibly" stated in the text.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image Processing:** An attacker could craft a malicious image or specify malicious dimensions during a call to `imagecrop` to trigger the vulnerability. This can be triggered in any application using the vulnerable `imagecrop` function.
- **Specifically Crafted Input:** An attacker could provide a crafted array to the `imagecrop` function that contains specially crafted `x`, `y`, `width`, or `height` values.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to call the `imagecrop` function:** The attacker must be able to trigger the `imagecrop` function with controllable parameters.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and how to craft input to exploit it.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided bug report includes POC (Proof of Concept) code that demonstrates how to trigger the various vulnerabilities.
- The report also contains proposed patches that aim to fix the vulnerabilities.
- The fix in PHP involves type checking and conversion in PHP bindings and improved bounds checking in libgd.
- The issue affects PHP versions 5.5.0 and newer (until the fix is applied).
- The fix includes addressing type checking, bounds checking, and preventing the modification of arguments after function calls.

**Summary of CVE-2014-2020 based on provided context:**
The CVE-2014-2020 is associated with multiple vulnerabilities within the `imagecrop` function of PHP's GD extension. These stem from insufficient input validation of the provided dimensions which can lead to crashes, information leaks, and potentially arbitrary code execution. Specifically, it has been identified as being related to the `imagecrop()` function in PHP which is vulnerable to type confusion, missing null pointer checks, integer overflows, and out-of-bounds reads. Exploiting these issues could result in denial of service, information leaks and potentially arbitrary code execution. The attack vector involves crafting a malicious image or specifying malicious dimensions during an `imagecrop` function call. The attacker needs to be able to call the `imagecrop` function with controllable parameters and have knowledge of the vulnerability.
