| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1077343#c0)  Petr Matousek    2014-03-17 19:17:27 UTC  ``` Description of the problem:  Some occurences in the netfilter tree use skb_header_pointer() in the following way ...    struct dccp_hdr _dh, *dh;   ...   skb_header_pointer(skb, dataoff, sizeof(_dh), &dh);  ... where dh itself is a pointer that is being passed as the copy buffer. Instead, we need to use &_dh as the forth argument so that we're copying the data into an actual buffer that sits on the stack.  A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.

The link pretty much sums up the mitigation options. I'd recommend to prevent nf_conntrack_proto_dccp module from being loaded by adding "install nf_conntrack_proto_dccp /bin/true" to file "/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf".

# USN-2174-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

26 April 2014

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of the SCTP handshake. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-0101](/security/CVE-2014-0101))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel's DCCP protocol support. A

remote attacked could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-2523](/security/CVE-2014-2523))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-363-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-363.76](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-363.76)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's handling of the SCTP handshake. A

remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2014-0101](/security/CVE-2014-0101))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel's DCCP protocol support. A

remote attacked could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-2523](/security/CVE-2014-2523))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

netfilter: nf\_conntrack\_dccp: fix skb\_header\_pointer API usages

```
Some occurences in the netfilter tree use skb_header_pointer() in
the following way ...

  struct dccp_hdr _dh, *dh;
  ...
  skb_header_pointer(skb, dataoff, sizeof(_dh), &dh);

... where dh itself is a pointer that is being passed as the copy
buffer. Instead, we need to use &_dh as the forth argument so that
we're copying the data into an actual buffer that sits on the stack.

Currently, we probably could overwrite memory on the stack (e.g.
with a possibly mal-formed DCCP packet), but unintentionally, as
we only want the buffer to be placed into _dh variable.
