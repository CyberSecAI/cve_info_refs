## Vulnerability in On-Screen Keyboard Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2975685)

Published: July 8, 2014 | Updated: July 16, 2014

**Version:** 1.1

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker uses a vulnerability in a low integrity process to execute the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) and upload a specially crafted program to the target system.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Windows except Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how some programs communicate with programs of a different integrity level. For more information about the vulnerability, see the **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)** subsection for the specific vulnerability in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.**Â Most customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For customers who do not have automatic updating enabled, the steps in [Turn automatic updating on or off](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=398470) can be used to enable automatic updating.

For enterprise installations, or administrators and end users who want to install this security update manually (including customers who have not enabled automatic updating), Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. The updates are also available via the download links in the **Affected Software** table in this bulletin.

For additional guidance, see the **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance** section in this bulletin.

## Update FAQ

**There are multiple updates listed for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. Do I need to install all the updates?**

No. Depending on how your system is configured to receive updates, only one of the updates for Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 will apply.

For systems running Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2:

Update 2973201 is for systems that already have the 2919355 (Windows 8.1 Update) update installed.

Update 2973906 is for systems without the 2919355 update installed. Note that the 2973906 update is only available for customers managing updates using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Windows Intune, or System Center Configuration Manager.

**For Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Windows RT 8.1 are there any prerequisites for the 2973201 update?**

Yes. Customers running Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2, or Windows RT 8.1 must first install the 2919355 (Windows 8.1 Update) update released in April, 2014 before installing theÂ 2973201Â update. For more information about the prerequisite update, seeÂ [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2919355](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. This update adds new security-related flags to the structures that developers use to author low-level keyboard and mouse input hooks. For detailed information about the functionality changes, see [KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644967%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) and [MSLLHOOKSTRUCT structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644970%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-2781](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-2781).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a local elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when the On-Screen keyboard is executed from within the context of a low integrity process.

**What is On-Screen Keyboard (OSK)?**

On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) is an Ease of Access tool in Microsoft Windows that allows users to move around their PC and enter text without having to use a physical, external keyboard. OSK displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys, which is accessible using a touch screen, mouse or other pointing device.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause an arbitrary program to execute at the same integrity level as the current user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to first use a vulnerability in a low integrity process to execute the On-Screen Keyboard and then have a method of uploading a specially crafted program to the target system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how some programs communicate with programs of a different integrity level. For more detailed information about the functionality changes that have been implemented with this update, see [KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644967%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) and [MSLLHOOKSTRUCT structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644970%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

For information about these and other tools that are available, seeÂ [Security Tools for IT Pros](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/cc297183).
