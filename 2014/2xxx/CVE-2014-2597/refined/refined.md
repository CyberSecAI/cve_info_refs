Vulnerability title: Denial of Service in PCNetSoftware RAC Server
CVE: CVE-2014-2597
Vendor: PCNetSoftware
Product: RAC Server
Affected version: 4.0.4, 4.0.5
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Kyriakos Economou

Details:
Latest and possibly earlier versions of RAC Server software are
vulnerable to local DoS attacks that can cause either to disable the
keyboard input or to kill the system through a BSoD, by sending specific
IOCTL codes to RACDriver.sys kernel mode driver. The attacker can choose
between the two.

The BSoD is triggered because the size of the input buffer received by
the driver is not correctly validated against the size of a static
buffer, inside the driver module itself, from where the driver transfers
some data to the allocated buffer.
The vulnerable function assumes that the size of the input buffer will
always be less or equal to the static one.
This leads to memory access violation inside the kernel address space
when the input buffer is too big, because the vulnerable function will
attempt to read outside the module itself.

Root cause of vulnerability: The driver does not validate the size of an input buffer against the size of a static buffer within the driver, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insufficient input validation.
- Out-of-bounds read.

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service (DoS).
- Disable keyboard input.
- System crash (Blue Screen of Death - BSoD).

Attack vectors:
- Sending specific IOCTL codes to the RACDriver.sys kernel mode driver.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local access to the system.
