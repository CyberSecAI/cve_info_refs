Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2014-2771:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer incorrectly handling the negotiation of certificates during a TLS session.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of TLS certificate negotiation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can hijack a mutually authenticated TLS connection between Internet Explorer and a target server.
- This could allow the attacker to decrypt encrypted traffic and retrieve sensitive information, such as authentication cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can use a malicious third party to leverage the TLS renegotiation command to re-establish a valid TLS session, resulting in the hijacking of the TLS connection.
- This can be done by getting the user to connect to a malicious server which would act as a proxy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate the TLS handshake process.
- The attacker needs to convince the user to connect to a malicious server.
- The attacker must be in a position to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by controlling a server.
