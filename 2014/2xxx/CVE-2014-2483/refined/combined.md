How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# RHSA-2014:0902 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Critical: java-1.7.0-oracle security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Critical

## Topic

Updated java-1.7.0-oracle packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Oracle Java for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having Critical
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Oracle Java SE version 7 includes the Oracle Java Runtime Environment and
the Oracle Java Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Oracle Java Runtime
Environment and the Oracle Java Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the Oracle Java SE Critical
Patch Update Advisory page, listed in the References section.
(CVE-2014-4219, CVE-2014-2490, CVE-2014-4216, CVE-2014-4223, CVE-2014-4262,
CVE-2014-2483, CVE-2014-4209, CVE-2014-4218, CVE-2014-4252, CVE-2014-4266,
CVE-2014-4221, CVE-2014-4244, CVE-2014-4263, CVE-2014-4227, CVE-2014-4265,
CVE-2014-4220, CVE-2014-4208, CVE-2014-4264)

The CVE-2014-4262 issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat
Product Security.

Note: The way in which the Oracle Java SE packages are delivered has
changed. They now reside in a separate channel/repository that requires
action from the user to perform prior to getting updated packages.
For information on subscribing to the new channel/repository please refer
to: <https://access.redhat.com/solutions/732883>

All users of java-1.7.0-oracle are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which provide Oracle Java 7 Update 65 and resolve these issues.
All running instances of Oracle Java must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

Synopsis:    VMware vSphere product updates address security
             vulnerabilities
Issue date:  2014-12-04
Updated on:  2014-12-04 (Initial Advisory)
CVE number:  CVE-2014-3797, CVE-2014-8371, CVE-2013-2877, CVE-2014-0191,
             CVE-2014-0015, CVE-2014-0138, CVE-2013-1752 and
             CVE-2013-4238
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Summary

   VMware vSphere product updates address a Cross Site Scripting issue,
   a certificate validation issue and security vulnerabilities in
   third-party libraries.

2. Relevant releases

   VMware vCenter Server Appliance 5.1 Prior to Update 3

   VMware vCenter Server 5.5 prior to Update 2
   VMware vCenter Server 5.1 prior to Update 3
   VMware vCenter Server 5.0 prior to Update 3c

   VMware ESXi 5.1 without patch ESXi510-201412101-SG

3. Problem Description

   a. VMware vCSA cross-site scripting vulnerability

      VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA) contains a vulnerability
      that may allow for Cross Site Scripting. Exploitation of this
      vulnerability in vCenter Server requires tricking a user to click
      on a malicious link or to open a malicious web page while they are
      logged in into vCenter.

      VMware would like to thank Tanya Secker of Trustwave SpiderLabs for
      reporting this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
      has assigned the name CVE-2014-3797 to this issue.

      Column 4 of the following table lists the action required to
      remediate the vulnerability in each release, if a solution is
      available.

      VMware         Product    Running   Replace with/
      Product        Version    on        Apply Patch
      =============  =======    =======   =================
      vCSA           5.5        any       Not Affected
      vCSA           5.1        any       5.1 Update 3
      vCSA           5.0        any       Not Affected

   b. vCenter Server certificate validation issue

      vCenter Server does not properly validate the presented certificate
      when establishing a connection to a CIM Server residing on an ESXi
      host. This may allow for a Man-in-the-middle attack against the CIM
      service.

      VMware would like to thank The Google Security Team for reporting
      this issue to us.

      The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)
