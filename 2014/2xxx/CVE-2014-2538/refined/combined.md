> <https://github.com/josh/rack-ssl/commit/9d7d7300b907e496db68d89d07fbc2e0df0b487b>

Use CVE-2014-2538.

The basis of this CVE assignment is that the rack-ssl product is
apparently accepting some level of responsibility for the behavior of
adapters. The commit message in 2013 wasn't really worded in the form
of a vulnerability-fix announcement. There's another interpretation in
which it would be categorized as security hardening to work around XSS
vulnerabilities in adapters. The commit message mentions jruby-rack.
<https://github.com/jruby/jruby-rack/blob/master/History.txt> includes
"1.1.12 (28/11/12) ... refactored / updated error handling ... unify
exception handling across decorating app factories with support for
configuring exception handling with the *jruby.rack.error* option."
Perhaps this means that jruby-rack is less likely to have a patch that
makes XSS impossible because the jruby-rack developers want exception
handling to be fully configurable? In any case, an additional CVE
assignment for jruby-rack could be made if the jruby-rack developers
want one. That might, for example, cover the case of using jruby-rack
with an unpatched version of rack-ssl.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
