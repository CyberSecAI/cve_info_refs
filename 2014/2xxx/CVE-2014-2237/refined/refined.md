{
  "CVE-2014-2237": {
    "description": "The memcache token backend in OpenStack Identity (keystone) does not properly invalidate trust tokens when impersonation is enabled. When a trustor issues a trust token with impersonation enabled, the token is only added to the trustor's token list and not to the trustee's token list. This results in the trust token not being invalidated by the trustee's token revocation (bulk revocation). This is most noticeable when the trustee user is disabled or the trustee changes a password. Only setups using the memcache backend for tokens in Keystone are affected.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The memcache token backend in OpenStack Identity (keystone) was not adding trust tokens to the trustee's token list, only to the trustor's token list.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect token handling",
        "Insufficient testing of memcache backend logic"
      ],
      "impact": "Trust tokens with impersonation enabled are not invalidated when the trustee's account is disabled, the trustee changes their password, or any other bulk revocation event occurs, allowing unauthorized access to services.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker with a trust-scoped token or account can issue a trust-scoped token. The vulnerability exists in how the tokens are stored when using the memcache backend and impersonation is enabled.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs a valid trust-scoped token or account and needs to be able to issue trust-scoped tokens with impersonation enabled."
    },
    "affected_versions": [
      "OpenStack Keystone versions 2013.1 up to 2013.1.4",
      "OpenStack Keystone versions 2013.2 up to 2013.2.2"
    ],
        "patch_details": {
            "fixes": [
                "Tokens are now added to both the Trustor and Trustee user-token-index, so that bulk token revocations work as expected.",
        "The memcache backend was migrated to the new KeyValueStore implementation"
