Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This can corrupt memory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability leading to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker gains complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website. An attacker could host such a site and convince a user to visit it through various means (e.g. email links, instant messages) or compromise legitimate websites to host the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website that the target user would visit using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. They would need to convince the user to visit the malicious site, either directly or indirectly.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows client systems and "Important" for Windows server systems.
- The document states that this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited at the time of the security bulletin's release.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 11 on Windows client and server systems.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

In summary, CVE-2014-2772 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer that can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of a vulnerable system if the user visits a malicious website.
