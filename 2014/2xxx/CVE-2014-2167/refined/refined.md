  "CVE-2014-2167": {
    "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the SIP code of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to become unresponsive and reload. These vulnerabilities are due to improper handling of crafted or malformed SIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the crafted packets to the affected system. These vulnerabilities can be triggered by SIP messages sent via UDP or TCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected. The default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP port 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061.",
