```
Root cause of vulnerability: The GetGo Download Manager copies HTTP response header values into a fixed-size buffer of 4097 bytes. However, it does not properly check the size of the incoming header and continues to write bytes until a "\r\n" sequence is found, leading to a buffer overflow if the header exceeds the buffer's capacity.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflow

Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution. An attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack to control the program's execution flow and execute arbitrary code.

Attack vectors: Sending a crafted HTTP response with an oversized header.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to control a web server that the GetGo Download Manager is attempting to download a file from.
