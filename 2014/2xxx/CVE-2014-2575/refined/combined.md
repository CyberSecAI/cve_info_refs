## Directory Traversal in DevExpress ASP.NET File Manager

During a penetration test RedTeam Pentesting discovered a directory
traversal vulnerability in DevExpress’ ASP.NET File Manager and File
Upload. Attackers are able to read arbitrary files by specifying a
relative path.

### Details

* Product: DevExpress ASPxFileManager Control for WebForms and MVC
* Affected Versions: DevExpress ASPxFileManager v10.2 to v13.2.8
* Fixed Versions: DevExpress ASPxFileManager v13.2.9
* Vulnerability Type: Directory Traversal
* Security Risk: high
* Vendor URL:
* `https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/ASP/File-Upload-Explorer/`
* Vendor Status: fixed version released
* Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2014-006`
* Advisory Status: published
* CVE: CVE-2014-2575
* CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2575`

### Introduction

“The DevExpress ASP.NET Subscription includes a standalone Multi-File
Upload Manager for WebForms and MVC and a pre-built File Manager for
WebForms; built so you can instantly introduce file management
capabilities in your next web application.”

(from DevExpress’ Homepage)

### More Details

The ASPX File Manager component is prone to a directory traversal
vulnerability. Attackers with access to the File Manager component can
read arbitrary files on the same partition as the shared directory.

A common request to download a file via the File Manager component
requires multiple HTTP-Post parameters:

```
__EVENTTARGET=ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24ASPxFileManager1
__EVENTARGUMENT=13%7C<file.ext>
__EVENTVALID=

```

The parameter \_\_EVENTARGUMENT=13|<file.ext> specifies a file download
and the file which is to be downloaded. Attackers may also request files
outside of the shared directory by prepending a relative path to a
parent directory.

### Proof of Concept

By requesting files with a relative path, files otherwise not available
will be accessible through the File Manager component. Depending on the
shared directory and the webserver configuration, the webserver
configuration file might for example be accessible through the File
Manager component:

Other sensitive operating system files could be affected, too.

Example exploit:

```
curl --data __EVENTTARGET=ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24ASPxFileManager1\
"&__EVENTARGUMENT=13%7C../../web.config&=&__EVENTVALID" \
http://example.com/FileManagerComponent.aspx

```

The request above will download the specified file.

### Workaround

Instead of a physical file system provider, a database file system
provider with limited access permissions could be used.

### Fix

Update ASPxFileManager control to DevExpress libraries version v13.2.9.

### Security Risk

The risk is estimated to be high. This vulnerability allows attackers to
access arbitrary files on the same partition as the File Manager’s root
directory. This may allow attackers to read sensitive information like
the webserver configuration.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# [RT-SA-2014-006] Directory Traversal in DevExpress ASP.NET File Manager

Advisory: Directory Traversal in DevExpress ASP.NET File Manager

During a penetration test RedTeam Pentesting discovered a directory
traversal vulnerability in DevExpress' ASP.NET File Manager and File
Upload. Attackers are able to read arbitrary files by specifying a
relative path.

Details
=======

Product: DevExpress ASPxFileManager Control for WebForms and MVC
Affected Versions: DevExpress ASPxFileManager v10.2 to v13.2.8
Fixed Versions: DevExpress ASPxFileManager v13.2.9
Vulnerability Type: Directory Traversal
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL:
    <https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/ASP/File-Upload-Explorer/>
Vendor Status: fixed version released
Advisory URL: <https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2014-006>
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2014-2575
CVE URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2575>

Introduction
============

"The DevExpress ASP.NET Subscription includes a standalone Multi-File
Upload Manager for WebForms and MVC and a pre-built File Manager for
WebForms; built so you can instantly introduce file management
capabilities in your next web application."

(from DevExpress' Homepage)

More Details
============

The ASPX File Manager component is prone to a directory traversal
vulnerability. Attackers with access to the File Manager component can
read arbitrary files on the same partition as the shared directory.

A common request to download a file via the File Manager component
requires multiple HTTP-Post parameters:

__EVENTTARGET=ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24ASPxFileManager1
__EVENTARGUMENT=13%7C<file.ext>
__EVENTVALID=

The parameter __EVENTARGUMENT=13|<file.ext> specifies a file download
and the file which is to be downloaded. Attackers may also request files
outside of the shared directory by prepending a relative path to a
parent directory.

Proof of Concept
================

By requesting files with a relative path, files otherwise not available
will be accessible through the File Manager component.  Depending on the
shared directory and the webserver configuration, the webserver
configuration file might for example be accessible through the File
Manager component:

__EVENTARGUMENT=13|../../web.config

Other sensitive operating system files could be affected, too.

Example exploit:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
curl --data __EVENTTARGET=ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolder1%24ASPxFileManager1\
"&__EVENTARGUMENT=13%7C../../web.config&=&__EVENTVALID" \
<http://example.com/FileManagerComponent.aspx>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The request above will download the specified file.

Workaround
==========

Instead of a physical file system provider, a database file system
provider with limited access permissions could be used.

Fix
===

Update ASPxFileManager control to DevExpress libraries version v13.2.9.

Security Risk
=============

The risk is estimated to be high. This vulnerability allows attackers to
access arbitrary files on the same partition as the File Manager's root
directory. This may allow attackers to read sensitive information like
the webserver configuration.

Timeline
========

2014-03-10 Vulnerability identified
2014-03-21 Customer approved disclosure to vendor
2014-03-21 CVE number requested and assigned
