```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The DevExpress ASPxFileManager component is vulnerable to directory traversal because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied file paths, allowing attackers to specify relative paths to access files outside of the intended directory.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Directory traversal vulnerability
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can read arbitrary files on the same partition as the shared directory of the file manager. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information like web server configuration files or other sensitive data.
- Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the file manager component, including a relative file path in the `__EVENTARGUMENT` parameter, an attacker can download arbitrary files.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs network access to the web application that utilizes the vulnerable DevExpress ASPxFileManager component. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the file manager component.
