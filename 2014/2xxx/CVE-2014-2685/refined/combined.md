Debian Bug     : 743175 754201

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Zend Framework, a PHP
framework. Except for CVE-2015-3154, all these issues were already fixed
in the version initially shipped with Jessie.

CVE-2014-2681

    Lukas Reschke reported a lack of protection against XML External
    Entity injection attacks in some functions. This fix extends the
    incomplete one from CVE-2012-5657.

CVE-2014-2682

    Lukas Reschke reported a failure to consider that the
    libxml_disable_entity_loader setting is shared among threads in the
    PHP-FPM case. This fix extends the incomplete one from
    CVE-2012-5657.

CVE-2014-2683

    Lukas Reschke reported a lack of protection against XML Entity
    Expansion attacks in some functions. This fix extends the incomplete
    one from CVE-2012-6532.

CVE-2014-2684

    Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov from the Ruhr-University
    Bochum reported an error in the consumer's verify method that lead
    to acceptance of wrongly sourced tokens.

CVE-2014-2685

    Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov from the Ruhr-University
    Bochum reported a specification violation in which signing of a
    single parameter is incorrectly considered sufficient.

CVE-2014-4914

    Cassiano Dal Pizzol discovered that the implementation of the ORDER
    BY SQL statement in Zend_Db_Select contains a potential SQL
    injection when the query string passed contains parentheses.

CVE-2014-8088

    Yury Dyachenko at Positive Research Center identified potential XML
    eXternal Entity injection vectors due to insecure usage of PHP's DOM
    extension.

CVE-2014-8089

    Jonas Sandstr√É¬∂m discovered an SQL injection vector when manually
    quoting value for sqlsrv extension, using null byte.

CVE-2015-3154

    Filippo Tessarotto and Maks3w reported potential CRLF injection
    attacks in mail and HTTP headers.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.11.13-1.1+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.9+dfsg-2+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
in version 1.12.12+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.12+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.

# ZF2014-02: Potential security issue in login mechanism of ZendOpenId and Zend\_OpenId consumer

Using the `Consumer` component of `ZendOpenId` (or `Zend_OpenId` in ZF1), it is
possible to login using an arbitrary OpenID account (without knowing any secret
information) by using a malicious OpenID Provider. That means OpenID it is
possible to login using arbitrary OpenID Identity (MyOpenID, Google, etc), which
are not under the control of our own OpenID Provider. Thus, we are able to
impersonate any OpenID Identity against the framework.

Moreover, the Consumer accepts OpenID tokens with arbitrary signed elements. The
framework does not check if, for example, both `openid.claimed_id` and
`openid.endpoint_url` are signed. It is just sufficient to sign one parameter.
According to <https://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#positive_assertions>,
at least `op_endpoint`, `return_to`, `response_nonce`, `assoc_handle`, and, if
present in the response, `claimed_id` and `identity`, must be signed.

## How the attack works

To realize the attack, we set up a malicious OpenID Provider (e.g.
`http://openid.evil.com`) that is able to generate valid OpenID tokens
containing arbitrary `openid.identifier` and `openid.claimed_id` values. At that
point, we can successfully authenticate with the issued identity controlled by
our Identity Provider, e.g. `http://openid.evil.com?identity=bob`. This confirms
that our Identity Provider works correctly. Then we log out. Afterwards, we
start the same login procedure, i.e. we submit the same Identity again
(`http://openid.evil.com?identity=bob`). According to the OpenID specification,
we are redirected to our Identity Provider (`http://openid.evil.com`). But this
time, we configure our Identity Provider to ignore the requested identity
(`http://openid.evil.com?identity=bob`) and instead use a victim's identity
(e.g. `openid.claimed_id=http://victim.myopenid.com/`,
`openid.identity=http://victim.myopenid.com/`, and additionally
`op_endpoint=http://www.myopenid.com/server`).

All other `openid.*` parameters are used as requested. Note that our Identity
Provider is not authorized to issue tokens in the name of other Identity
Providers (such as MyOpenID, Google, etc.). However, the token is accepted by
the framework. In this manner we could impersonate other users/identities
without knowing any credentials and secrets.

## Action Taken

We have made the following changes to `ZendOpenId\Consumer\GenericConsumer` and
`Zend_OpenId_Consumer` classes:

* During the `verify()` method of the consumer, if the `openid_op_endpoint`
  value is different from the previous server, related to the same
  `openid_assoc_handle`, we return `false`, reporting an error.
* Before the signature validation of the `openid_sig` parameter, we check that
* the required parameters (as noted in the [assertion section of the OpenID specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html#positive_assertions))
  are all present in the `openid_signed` list.

The following releases contain the fixes:

* Zend Framework 1, version 1.12.4
* ZendOpenId, version 2.0.2

## Other Information

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and
working with us to help protect its users:

* Christian Mainka and
  Vladislav Mladenov, researchers at the
  Ruhr-University Bochum, for alerting us to the issue and for the suggestions
  on how to fix it;
* Enrico Zimuel (enrico@zend.com) for implementing a solution.

## Description

```
Updated php-ZendFramework packages fix security vulnerabilities:

XML eXternal Entity (XXE) and XML Entity Expansion (XEE) flaws were
discovered in the Zend Framework. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service, access files accessible to the server process, or
possibly perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
(CVE-2014-2681, CVE-2014-2682, CVE-2014-2683).

Using the Consumer component of Zend_OpenId, it is possible to login using an
arbitrary OpenID account (without knowing any secret information) by using a
malicious OpenID Provider. That means OpenID it is possible to login using
arbitrary OpenID Identity (MyOpenID, Google, etc), which are not under the

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

This is somewhat complex in the sense that all of the issues are
within the scope of CVE but the disclosures only marginally have
enough information to determine the correct number of CVE IDs. We did
not want to combine independent discoveries into the same CVE ID.

<http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-01>

CVE-2014-2681 - This CVE is for the lack of protection against XML
External Entity injection attacks in some functions, because of the
incomplete fix in CVE-2012-5657. It appears that this only affects
Zend Framework 1.x, although that isn't critical to determining the
number of CVE IDs.

CVE-2014-2682 - This CVE is for the failure to consider that the
libxml_disable_entity_loader setting is shared among threads in the
PHP-FPM case. Again, the existence of this CVE means that the
CVE-2012-5657 fix was incomplete. It appears that this affects more
than just Zend Framework 1.x, although that isn't critical to
determining the number of CVE IDs.

CVE-2014-2683 - This CVE is for the lack of protection against XML
Entity Expansion attacks in some functions, because of the incomplete
fix in CVE-2012-6532. It appears that this also affects more than just
Zend Framework 1.x, although that isn't critical to determining the
number of CVE IDs.

<http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-02>

CVE-2014-2684 - This CVE is for the error in the consumer's verify
method that leads to acceptance of wrongly sourced tokens. The same
CVE is used for Zend Framework 1.x and ZendOpenId 2.x, even though the
code is not identical.

CVE-2014-2685 - This CVE is for the specification violation in which
signing of a single parameter is incorrectly considered sufficient.
Again, this CVE is for both Zend Framework 1.x and ZendOpenId 2.x.
