### Take Global Control Over Your WordPress Site

### Disable Comments On Posts, Pages & Media

Choose which posts, pages or media should allow comments from site visitors & configure Disable Comments accordingly

### Disallow Comments On Multi-Site Network

Have multiple websites? Get rid of irrelevant comments on the entire network using Disable Comments Plugin

### KEY FEATURES OF DISABLE COMMENTS

* All ‚ÄúComments‚Äù links are hidden from the Admin Menu and Admin Bar.
* All comment-related sections (‚ÄúRecent Comments‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù etc.) are hidden from the WordPress Dashboard.

* All comment RSS/Atom feeds are disabled (and requests for these will be redirected to the parent post).
* The X-Pingback HTTP header is removed from all pages.
* Outgoing pingbacks are disabled.
* Stop spam comments entirely from the site with one click.
* **[New]** Delete comments by type.
* **[New]** Disable comments via [XML-RPC](https://wpdeveloper.com/docs/how-to-disable-comments-made-via-xml-rpc/) & [REST-API](https://wpdeveloper.com/docs/how-to-disable-comments-made-via-rest-api/)
* **[New]** Fully Multi-site Network supported.
* **[New]** Manage multiple website network-specific subsites or entire network comments in advance.
* **[New]** Exclude Disable Comments Settings based on user roles.

Please delete any existing comments on your site **before applying this setting**, otherwise (depending on your theme) those comments may still be displayed to visitors. You can use the **Delete Comments tool** to delete any existing comments on your site.

### üåü WHAT‚ÄôS NEW WITH DISABLE COMMENTS 2.0

**AMAZING USER FRIENDLY INTERFACE**

Easily configure your comment-related settings with an amazing and attractive app-like user interface.

**WP-CLI COMMANDS TO DISABLE COMMENTS**

Use [WP-CLI](https://wpdeveloper.com/docs/how-to-use-disable-comments-plugin-with-wp-cli-command-line/) control for comment-related settings to disable comments on posts, pages, attachments or everywhere on your website.

**GET STARTED WITH QUICK SETUP WIZARD**

Use the quick setup wizard after activating the plugin to instantly configure comment-related settings for your WordPress website.

**DISABLE COMMENTS ON DOCS**

Instantly disable comments on your documentation pages or WordPress knowledge base with a single click.

**DELETE CERTAIN COMMENT TYPE(S)**

Permanently delete certain comment types from your WordPress website including WooCommerce product reviews as well as generic comments.

**DISABLE COMMENTS VIA XML-RPC And REST API**

Block any comments made on your WordPress website via XML-RPC specification and REST API.

**Important note**: Use this plugin if you don‚Äôt want comments at all on your site (or on certain post types). Don‚Äôt use it if you want to selectively disable comments on individual posts ‚Äì WordPress lets you do that anyway. If you don‚Äôt know how to disable comments on individual posts, there are instructions in **[the FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/#faq).**

If you come across any bugs or have suggestions, please use the plugin support forum. I can‚Äôt fix it if I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs broken! Please check the **[FAQ](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/#faq)** for common issues.

Want to contribute? Here‚Äôs the **[GitHub development repository](https://github.com/WPDevelopers/disable-comments)**.

A [must-use version](https://github.com/WPDevelopers/disable-comments-mu) of the plugin is also available.

### Advanced Configuration

Some of the plugin‚Äôs behavior can be modified by site administrators and plugin/theme developers through code:

* Define `DISABLE_COMMENTS_REMOVE_COMMENTS_TEMPLATE` and set it to `false` to prevent the plugin from replacing the theme‚Äôs comment template with an empty one.
* Define `DISABLE_COMMENTS_ALLOW_DISCUSSION_SETTINGS` and set it to `true` to prevent the plugin from hiding the Discussion settings page.

These definitions can be made either in your main `wp-config.php` or in your theme‚Äôs `functions.php` file.

**THIS PLUGIN IS NOW MAINTAINED BY THE TEAM** [WPDeveloper](https://wpdeveloper.com/).

## FAQ

### Nothing happens after I disable comments on all posts ‚Äì comment forms still appear when I view my posts.

This is because your theme is not checking the comment status of posts in the correct way.

You may like to point your theme‚Äôs author to [this explanation](https://wpdeveloper.com/wordpress-posts-have-comments-allowed/) of what they are doing wrong, and how to fix it.

### How can I remove the text that says ‚Äúcomments are closed‚Äù at the bottom of articles where comments are disabled?

The plugin tries its very best to hide this (and any other comment-related) messages.

If you still see the message, then it means your theme is overriding this behaviour, and you will have to edit its files manually to remove it. Two common approaches are to either delete or comment out the relevant lines in `wp-content/your-theme/comments.php`, or to add a declaration to `wp-content/your-theme/style.css` that hides the message from your visitors. In either case, make you you know what you are doing!

### I only want to disable comments on certain posts, not globally. What do I do?

Go to the edit page for the post you want to disable comments on. Scroll down to the ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù box, where you will find the comment options for that post. If you don‚Äôt see a ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù box, then click on ‚ÄúScreen Options‚Äù at the top of your screen, and make sure the ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù checkbox is checked.

You can also bulk-edit the comment status of multiple posts from the [posts screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Posts_Screen).

### I want to delete comments from my database. What do I do?

Go to the tools page for the Disable Comments plugin and utlize the Delete Comments tool to delete all comments or according to the specified post types from your database.

This plugin has been a lifesaver for managing comments! The spam filter is fantastic, and the threaded comment structure adds great interactivity. However, sometimes legitimate comments get flagged as spam. It would be great if the plugin could learn over time which types of comments are safe.

Does its job nicely, support is excellent, I reported an issue which was fixed very quickly.
I do have to say I would have liked the plugin to stay more minimal, as was the case before v2.0. It looks a bit heavy for what it‚Äôs doing right now.
