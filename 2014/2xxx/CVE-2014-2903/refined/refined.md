Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2903:

**CVE Description:**

The content does not include an official description of CVE-2014-2903. However, it does specify the vulnerability as:

> Server certificate not authorized for use in SSL/TLS handshake

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the server certificate is not authorized for use in the SSL/TLS handshake. This indicates an issue with the certificate's validity or its intended usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The system fails to properly validate if a server certificate is authorized for use in the SSL/TLS handshake. This could be due to missing checks against certificate usage constraints, such as key usage extensions or extended key usage extensions.
*   **Semantic Discrepancy:** This vulnerability falls under a broader category of semantic discrepancies in certificate validation. This means there's a mismatch between what the certificate says it's authorized for, and how the software interprets it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker could potentially present a certificate that is not authorized for a server TLS handshake. If accepted by the client, this would allow the attacker to intercept, decrypt, and potentially modify communication between the client and the server, impersonating the legitimate server.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete breach of confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Certificate Presentation:** An attacker could present an invalid server certificate during the TLS handshake process.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept and manipulate network traffic between a client and a server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
*   **Certificate Manipulation:** The attacker requires the ability to provide a certificate that is not authorized for use in the TLS handshake.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is listed as part of a set of certificate validation issues identified by research from the University of Texas (https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak14.pdf).

* The vulnerability was not fixed in CyaSSL 2.9.4, which was the focus of other vulnerabilities discussed in the email.
