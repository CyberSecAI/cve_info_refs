Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2949

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Specifically, it's due to the improper handling of user-supplied input in the `filerName` field within the `discoverFilerBasicInfo.jsft` page of the F5 ARX Data Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `filerName` input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the backend database.
*   **Full Administrator Credentials:** The attacker can leverage the SQL injection to gain full administrator credentials for the Data Manager.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability can potentially lead to remote code execution on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP request to the `discoverFilerBasicInfo.jsft` page.
*   **`filerName` Parameter:** The injected SQL code is placed within the `filerName` field of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the F5 ARX Data Manager.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, meaning it can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects F5 ARX Data Manager versions 3.0.0 to 3.1.0.
*   The vendor considers the affected versions end-of-life and will not provide a security patch.
*   The vendor recommends stopping the Data Manager service when not in use as a mitigation.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor by Andrea Micalizzi (rgod) through HP's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
*   ZDI disclosed the vulnerability publicly after a 120 day deadline without a patch from the vendor.
