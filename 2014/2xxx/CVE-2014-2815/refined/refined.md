  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2014-2815": {
      "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft OneNote parses specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft OneNote fails to properly handle specially crafted OneNote files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of specially crafted files"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the system.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Email with a malicious attachment",
        "Websites hosting malicious OneNote files"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to open the malicious file. In the case of a web-based attack, they also need to convince the user to visit a malicious webpage and open the file there."
