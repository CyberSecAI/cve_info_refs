Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

-   PowerArchiver version 14.02.03 incorrectly uses the legacy PKZIP encryption method instead of the selected AES encryption when using the "Encrypt Files" button.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Incorrect Encryption Implementation:** Despite the user selecting AES encryption, the application defaults to the insecure legacy PKZIP encryption.
-   **Use of Broken Algorithm:** The legacy PKZIP encryption algorithm is known to be broken since 1994.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Compromised Data Confidentiality:** Files intended to be protected by strong AES encryption are instead encrypted using a weak, easily crackable algorithm.
-   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers can potentially decrypt the files easily due to the insecure encryption, gaining access to sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user specifically uses the "Encrypt Files" button within the application and selects AES encryption.
-   **Malicious Archive Creation:** An attacker could create a seemingly AES encrypted archive using the vulnerable version of PowerArchiver, which in fact uses the weak PKZIP encryption, and distribute it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Access to the Encrypted Archive:** The attacker needs access to the archive file created using the vulnerable PowerArchiver version.
-   **Knowledge of PKZIP Weaknesses:** The attacker requires knowledge of known techniques to crack PKZIP encrypted archives. No special position or specific access is required other than obtaining the archive.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability only occurs when using the "Encrypt Files" button, other methods may function as expected.
- The vendor ConeXware fixed the issue in version 14.02.05 and also disabled the support for creating archives with the legacy PKZIP encryption.
