  "CVE-2014-2850": {
    "related_to_cve": true,
    "description": "This module takes advantage of two vulnerabilities in order to gain remote code execution as root as an otherwise non-privileged authorized user. By taking advantage of a mass assignment vulnerability that allows an unprivileged authenticated user to change the administrator's password hash, the module updates the password to login as the admin to reach the second vulnerability. No server-side sanitization is done on values passed when configuring a static network interface. This allows an administrator user to run arbitrary commands in the context of the web application, which is root when configuring the network interface.",
    "root_cause": "Mass assignment vulnerability and lack of server-side sanitization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Mass assignment vulnerability allowing unprivileged users to change the admin password hash.",
      "Lack of server-side sanitization when configuring a static network interface, leading to command injection."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution as root.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Authentication as a non-privileged user.",
      "Changing the admin password hash via the mass assignment vulnerability.",
      "Logging in as admin.",
      "Injecting a malicious command via the network interface configuration."
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the web appliance."
