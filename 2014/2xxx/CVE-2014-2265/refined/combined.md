### [Simple Contact Form](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/simple-contact-form-13/)

I’ve been using Contact Form 7 for years, and it’s undoubtedly one of the most reliable and versatile plugins for creating contact forms. Its simplicity, compatibility, and lightweight nature make it an excellent choice for WordPress users. The ease of customization and integration with other tools is impressive, and it has served my websites flawlessly.
That said, I’d love to see a few enhancements to make this plugin even better. Adding a built-in date and calendar feature would simplify creating forms for bookings or appointments. Improving dropdown menu styling options would also be a great touch to enhance form aesthetics. Overall, this plugin remains a must-have for any WordPress site, and I look forward to seeing its future updates!

Why it’s unusable? This plugin was working so fine. Customize it it’s a nightmare!

Overhyped plugin simply because it is free. It is the ultimate barebones of a plugin that people find necessary. There are no features, customizing anything means you are either a) a programmer or b) have to email support (in which case good luck getting help, egos too big). Gets no updates, no features, no accessibility or UX improvements. You’re better off paying for a plugin than pulling your hair out to get it working as needed.

The team is highly responsive and helpful. They arranged a Google Meet session to assist me with an API and JSON data format issue, thoroughly resolving the problem on my end.

[WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITIES](/vulnerabilities/)

[Standard & Premium](/vulnerabilities/web/)
# WordPress 5.1.x Multiple Vulnerabilities (5.1 - 5.1.16)

## Description

WordPress is prone to multiple vulnerabilities, including cross-site scripting, shortcode execution, information disclosure and Denial of Service via cache poisoning vulnerabilities. Exploiting these issues could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site, allowing the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, to execute shortcodes by calling the built-in 'parse-media-shortcode' AJAX handler, to obtain sensitive information or to deny REST API endpoint access to legitimate users. WordPress versions 5.1.x ranging from 5.1 and up to (and including) 5.1.16 are vulnerable.

## Remediation

Update to WordPress version 5.1.17 or latest

**Hannah discovers bug in Contact Form 7 to bypass CAPTCHA**

Contact Form 7 is one of the most popular website contact forms implemented throughout websites developed using WordPress. It allows users to quickly and easily submit a message or query to the owner of the site without the need to compose an entire email using a regular client.

Contact Form 7 makes use of a CAPTCHA facility in order to prevent the risk of exploitation from bots and potential attackers. An exploitation could result in an influx of requests, resulting in a possible Denial of Service attack against the site’s email recipients.

Whilst testing this CAPTCHA facility on our own website, Hedgehog Security were able to bypass this feature and flood our inbox with thousands of requests.

The author of the plugin has now been notified and a fix was released within a matter of hours. To apply the fix, visit the link below and update to version 3.7.2:

[http://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/changelog/](http://web.archive.org/web/20140727133642/http%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/changelog/)

As a further precaution, it is advised that users of contact forms within their website(s) protect themselves by limiting the recipients of their contact forms, as well as to create an inbox rule to place the messages into a separate inbox folder.

#### **CVE-2014-2265**

This vulnerability has now been granted a CVE-ID. This can be viewed at [www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2265](http://web.archive.org/web/20140727133642/http%3A//www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2265)

An advisory for this vulnerability may also be viewed below:

| **CVE:** | CVE-2014-2265 |
| --- | --- |
| **Vendor:** | Rock Lobster, LLC. |
| **Product:** | ContactForm7 |
| **Affected Version:** | 3.7.1 and earlier |
| **Fixed Version:** | 3.7.2 |
| **Reported by:** | Hannah Sharp |

**Details:**

It is possible to bypass the CAPTCHA facility and fill the recipient’s inbox with an influx of requests. The removal of the ‘\_wpcf7\_captcha\_challenge\_captcha-719’ parameter (or just the contents of the parameter) from a request sent via a form using CAPTCHA allows the sender to bypass validation. Because of this, a sender is able to automate the transmission of a huge number of emails to the site’s email recipients.

The following is an example request sent via ContactForm7 using CAPTCHA:

```
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: <host>
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:27.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/27.0
Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: <referer>
Content-Length: 238
Connection: keep-alive
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
```
```
_wpcf7=8323&_wpcf7_version=3.7.1&_wpcf7_locale=en_US&_wpcf7_unit_tag=wpcf7-f8323-p3257-o1&_wpnonce=1065493e2c&your-name=bob+bobby&tel-429=123412341234&_wpcf7_captcha_challenge_captcha-719=861542724&captcha-719=qwerty&_wpcf7_is_ajax_call=1
```

**Impact:**

Potential Denial of Service attack against the site’s email recipients.

**Exploit:**

Exploit code is not required.
