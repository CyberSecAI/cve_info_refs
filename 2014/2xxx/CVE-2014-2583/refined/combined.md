development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Linux-PAM. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Remote attackers could cause Denial of Service, conduct brute force
attacks, and conduct username enumeration.

### Workaround

# USN-2935-3: PAM regression

17 March 2016

USN-2935-1 introduced a regression in PAM.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pam](/security/cves?package=pam) - Pluggable Authentication Modules

## Details

USN-2935-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PAM. The updates contained a packaging

change that prevented upgrades in certain multiarch environments. USN-2935-2

intended to fix the problem but was incomplete for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. This

update fixes the problem in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the PAM pam\_userdb module incorrectly used a

case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker

could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7041](/security/CVE-2013-7041))

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam\_timestamp module incorrectly

performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create

arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-2583](/security/CVE-2014-2583))

Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam\_unix module incorrectly handled

large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain

environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-3238](/security/CVE-2015-3238))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [libpam-modules](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam)
  -
  [1.1.3-7ubuntu2.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam/1.1.3-7ubuntu2.3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

# USN-2935-2: PAM regression

16 March 2016

USN-2935-1 introduced a regression in PAM.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pam](/security/cves?package=pam) - Pluggable Authentication Modules

## Details

USN-2935-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PAM. The updates contained a packaging

change that prevented upgrades in certain multiarch environments. This

update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the PAM pam\_userdb module incorrectly used a

case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker

could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7041](/security/CVE-2013-7041))

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam\_timestamp module incorrectly

performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create

arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-2583](/security/CVE-2014-2583))

Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam\_unix module incorrectly handled

large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain

environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-3238](/security/CVE-2015-3238))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 15.10

* [libpam-modules](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam)
  -
  [1.1.8-3.1ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam/1.1.8-3.1ubuntu3.2)

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [libpam-modules](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam)
  -
  [1.1.8-1ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam/1.1.8-1ubuntu2.2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

Use CVE-2014-2583. As usual, there are not separate CVE IDs for the
different impacts.

There is no CVE ID for the issue in which the documentation might
not be sufficient to prevent all problematic uses of pam_timestamp in
conjunction with remote services. The documentation at
<http://www.linux-pam.org/Linux-PAM-html/sag-pam_timestamp.html> and
elsewhere specifically mentions "This is similar mechanism which is
used in sudo" and "FILES /var/run/sudo/..." in fairly prominent ways.
The documentation is not directly misleading, i.e., there doesn't seem
to be any implication that a remote service is a recommended use case.

# USN-2935-1: PAM vulnerabilities

16 March 2016

Several security issues were fixed in PAM.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 15.10](/security/notices?release=wily)
* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [pam](/security/cves?package=pam) - Pluggable Authentication Modules

## Details

It was discovered that the PAM pam\_userdb module incorrectly used a

case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker

could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This

issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7041](/security/CVE-2013-7041))

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam\_timestamp module incorrectly

performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create

arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only

affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-2583](/security/CVE-2014-2583))

Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam\_unix module incorrectly handled

large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain

environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2015-3238](/security/CVE-2015-3238))

Subject: pam_timestamp internals

Hi

When playing with some PAM modules for my own projects, I came
across some implications of pam_timestamp (which is part of
upstream linux-pam) that should probably be addressed.

Most importantly, there seems to be a path traversal issue:

static int
format_timestamp_name(char *path, size_t len,
                      const char *timestamp_dir,
                      const char *tty,
                      const char *ruser,
                      const char *user)
{
        if (strcmp(ruser, user) == 0) {
                return snprintf(path, len, "%s/%s/%s", timestamp_dir,
                                ruser, tty);
        } else {
                return snprintf(path, len, "%s/%s/%s:%s", timestamp_dir,
                                ruser, tty, user);
        }
}

If attacker can control PAM_RUSER or PAM_TTY item and pam_timestamp is "sufficient",
(it makes sense to have it sufficient, as it aims to mimic sudo timestamp tickets
and is suggested so in the man page)
they can bypass authentication. PAM_RUSER is set in vsftpd or sssd for example.
PAM_TTY can be set via dbus in gdm's x11-display variable.

That has the following impact:

1. For authentication, this can allow to bypass the auth process, depending on
interal app logic and the existance of certain root owned files (the file
size is checked to match certain value, but chances are that such files
exist somewhere under /). For openssh, if accidently included via auth-common,
this can be dangerous, as the PAM_TTY is always set to "ssh". However due to
PAM_TTY_KLUDGE #ifdef and internal sshd logic this probably is no issue as of today.

2. When a vector is also handling pam sessions (sssd), this bug also allows to create arbitrary
files when the timestamp file is created and I guess content can be crafted with so much love
to create fake shadow-file entries is possible.

One should probably take care to not accidently include pam_timestamp in a config file
for a remote service, as chance is high that the RUSER/TTY is used incorrectly, even
when the user string is checked via getpwnam(). It should probably be documented in
pam_timestamp's manpage.

We are not using pam_timestamp in any of our configs, but might be that someone else is.
Even if not, I think a lot of admins do.

regards,
Sebastian
