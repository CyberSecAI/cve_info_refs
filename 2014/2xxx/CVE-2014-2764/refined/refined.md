{
  "CVE-2014-2764": {
    "relevance": "RELEVANT",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer does not properly validate permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could elevate privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer. This vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, this vulnerability could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code. For example, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run arbitrary code through Internet Explorer, but due to the context in which processes are launched by Internet Explorer, the code might be restricted to run at a low integrity level (very limited permissions). However, an attacker could, in turn, exploit any of these vulnerabilities to cause the arbitrary code to run at a medium integrity level (permissions of the current user).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack scenario - attacker hosts a website or uses compromised websites with specially crafted content.",
      "Email or Instant Messenger - attacker convinces the user to click a link or open an attachment."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to convince a user to view the attacker-controlled content (website, email, etc.)."
