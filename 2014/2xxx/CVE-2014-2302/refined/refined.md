Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2302:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the failure of the webEdition CMS installer script to automatically delete itself after installation. The installer script contains a feature to process a serialized PHP object that is fetched from `update.webedition.org`. The script accepts a "Type" value of "eval" which allows the execution of arbitrary PHP code supplied as the value of a "Code" field in the serialized object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** The installer script does not remove itself after installation, leaving it accessible. This allows an attacker to exploit the "eval" functionality by injecting malicious PHP code.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application processes serialized PHP objects without proper validation, allowing arbitrary code execution by crafting a malicious serialized object with a "Type" value of "eval" and malicious code in the "Code" value.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The installer script does not sanitize or validate the data received from the update server, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through the `Code` parameter of the serialized PHP object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the web server, potentially leading to full server compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker could gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Complete System Takeover:** If the webserver user has enough permissions, the attacker could gain control of the entire system.
*   **Malicious Reinstallation:** The attacker can also use the installer to maliciously reinstall the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests made by the webEdition installer to `update.webedition.org`.
*   **Proxy Server:** The vulnerability is exploited by configuring a proxy server under the attacker's control in the installer, enabling the attacker to deliver crafted responses.
*   **URL Access:** The attacker triggers the exploit by re-accessing the installer script using the URL: `http://www.example.com/OnlineInstaller/setup.php?&leWizard=DownloadInstaller`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the server running the webEdition CMS, and to inject proxy settings into the installer.
*   **Control of Proxy Server:** The attacker needs to have a proxy server that they control to intercept and modify the responses from the update server.
*   **Basic Knowledge of PHP and HTTP:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious serialized PHP object and understand how HTTP requests and responses work.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability exists because the installer script is not removed automatically after the installation process.
* The exploit is triggered by setting up a malicious proxy and then accessing a specific URL that re-triggers the download functionality
* The fix involves removing the installer through the CMS login dialog.
* The provided text includes a proof of concept, demonstrating how to trigger the execution of phpinfo() using the vulnerability.
