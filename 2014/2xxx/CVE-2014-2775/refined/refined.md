**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability. When Internet Explorer handles objects in memory incorrectly, it can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. This means that if the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.

- **Compromised websites and user-provided content:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or through sites accepting user-generated content, such as advertisements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host or inject malicious code:** The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage or inject malicious code into a legitimate website.
- **User interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to visit the malicious website or interact with the malicious content, typically by clicking a link or opening an attachment.
