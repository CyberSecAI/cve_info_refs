Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Raritan PX power distribution software's improper handling of IPMI authentication. Specifically, it allows the use of cipher suite 0 (also known as "cipher zero") with an arbitrary password to bypass authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The software fails to properly validate authentication attempts when the cipher zero suite is used.
- **Use of Cipher Zero:** The software's support for cipher zero, which provides no encryption, allows attackers to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Administrative Access:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can log in and administer the affected device with full permissions, effectively taking complete control.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary IPMI commands on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
- **IPMI Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the IPMI interface of the Raritan PX power distribution device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's IPMI interface.
- **Knowledge of IPMI:** Basic knowledge of IPMI commands is required to fully exploit the access.
- **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials, as authentication is bypassed by using cipher suite 0 and an arbitrary password.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Raritan PX power distribution software version 01.05.08 and earlier, specifically on model DPXR20A-16. Other models may also be affected.
- The vulnerability was reported by Joerg Kost.
- The vendor, Raritan, initially claimed to have fixed the issue but did not release a firmware update for verification.
- Workarounds suggested include blocking IPMI port 623, restricting the management network, and not using Raritan products.
