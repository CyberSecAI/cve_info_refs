Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2196

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain types of requests within the SharePoint prefetch optimization code of Cisco WAAS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Buffer Overflow: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the SharePoint prefetch optimization code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Cisco WAAS device with elevated privileges.
- **Device Crash:** The vulnerability could also cause the optimization process to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to authenticate.
- **Malicious SharePoint Server:** An attacker could convince a user to connect to a malicious SharePoint installation. This server would supply a malformed response to a user request that is then optimized by the affected device, triggering the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the responses sent from a SharePoint server.
- The attacker does not need any prior authentication to the vulnerable Cisco WAAS device.
- The attacker must be able to convince a user to connect to a malicious SharePoint server when the traffic is passing through the vulnerable Cisco WAAS device.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability only affects Cisco WAAS software versions 5.1.1 through 5.1.1d when configured with the SharePoint prefetch optimization feature enabled.
- The SharePoint prefetch option is disabled by default, and is enabled with the command `accelerator http sharepoint-opt prefetch enable`.
- The CVSS base score is 9.3, and the temporal score is 7.7.
- There are no workarounds, the solution is to upgrade to version 5.1.1e.
