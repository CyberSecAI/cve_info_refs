| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 9.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.7 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.7 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Wide Area Application Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Critical   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20140521-waas  First Published: 2014 May 21 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCue18479](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue18479)     CVE-2014-2196     CWE-119       CVSS Score: [Base 9.3, Temporal 7.7](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2014-2196     CWE-119       Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) software versions 5.1.1 through 5.1.1d, when configured with the SharePoint acceleration feature, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exploit a buffer overflow and cause arbitrary code execution.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following products running a vulnerable version of Cisco WAAS software and configured with the SharePoint prefetch option are affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco WAAS appliances   + Cisco Virtual WAAS (vWAAS)   + Cisco WAAS modulesThe prefetch option is enabled by the following command **accelerator http sharepoint-opt prefetch enable**. This option is disabled by default.      **Note:** Only Cisco WAAS software releases 5.1.1 through 5.1.1.d are affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether the SharePoint prefetch option has been enabled do one of the following:      Check the output of **sh run | include prefetch**. If the command returns as shown in the following example, the prefetch option is enabled: ```   waas_lab#sh run | include prefetch   accelerator http sharepoint-opt prefetch enable   ```    Check the output of the **show accelerator http** command and look for the **SharePoint Prefetch** line. The following output example demonstrates a system that has enabled the SharePoint Accelerator: ```   waas_lab#show accelerator http      Accelerator    	Licensed       	Config State   	Operational State   -----------    	--------       	------------   	-----------------   http           	Yes            	Enabled        	Running      HTTP:      Accelerator Config Item            Mode        Value      -----------------------            ----        ------      Suppress Server Encoding           Default     Disabled   [...]      Sharepoint Prefetch                User        Enabled   [...]   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableThe following products running Cisco WAAS software are not affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco WAAS Express (WAASx)   + Cisco WAAS MobileNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco WAAS application acceleration and WAN optimization solutions accelerate the performance of any TCP-based application delivered across a WAN, providing the benefits of branch-office data consolidation and acceleration of centralized applications.      A vulnerability in the SharePoint prefetch optimization code of Cisco WAAS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the optimization process to crash and may allow arbitrary execution code on the affected system.      The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain types of requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to connect to a malicious SharePoint installation that could supply a malformed response to a user request that is optimized by an affected device. A successful attack could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with elevated privileges.      **Note:** Only Cisco WAAS software that is specifically configured with SharePoint prefetch optimization is affected by this vulnerability. This option is disabled by default.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue18479](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue18479) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2196.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * The following table lists the recommended releases for each Cisco WAAS software major release:      | Major Releases | Recommended Release |   | --- | --- |   | 4.x | Not affected |   | 5.0.x | Not affected |   | 5.1.x | 5.1.1e |   | 5.2.x | Not affected |   | 5.3.x | Not affected |         **Note:** Only Cisco WAAS software releases 5.1.1 through 5.1.1.d are affected by this vulnerability.      When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release.
