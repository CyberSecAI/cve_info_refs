Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-2256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper Resource Shutdown or Release, specifically within the processing of ISO-TSAP packets on port 102/TCP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the device's inability to properly handle specially crafted ISO-TSAP packets. This leads to a resource management issue, causing the device to enter a defect mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The device enters a defect mode, requiring a cold restart to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends specially crafted ISO-TSAP packets to the vulnerable device via port 102/TCP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. A low skill level is sufficient for exploitation.

**Additional Information:**
- The Siemens advisory (SSA-654382) indicates that the vulnerability is due to "Improper Input Validation" (CWE-20). This is a more specific description of the root cause compared to the CWE-404 mapping provided by ICS-CERT. The Siemens advisory also provides a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C), while the ICS-CERT advisory states the CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
