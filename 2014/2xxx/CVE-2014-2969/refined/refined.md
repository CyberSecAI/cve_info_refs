- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Netgear GS105PE Prosafe Plus Switch firmware version 1.2.0.5 contains hard-coded login credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Hard-coded credentials (username: ntgruser, password: debugpassword).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can log into the device's web server. This access allows the attacker to:
  - Modify the serial number and MAC address of the product.
  - Manually set memory values and extract them.
  - Upload new firmware, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending network requests to the device's web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device and does not require prior authentication.
