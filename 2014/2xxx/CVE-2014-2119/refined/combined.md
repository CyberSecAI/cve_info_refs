| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 8.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 7.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 7.0 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco AsyncOS Software Code Execution Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20140319-asyncos  First Published: 2014 March 19 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCug79377](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug79377)  [CSCug80118](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug80118)     CVE-2014-2119     CWE-20       CVSS Score: [Base 8.5, Temporal 7.0](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2014-2119     CWE-20       Email      Summary  * Cisco AsyncOS Software for Email Security Appliance (ESA) and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) contain a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the *root* user.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsAll models of   Cisco ESA and Cisco SMA running a vulnerable version of Cisco IronPort   AsyncOS Software or Cisco AsyncOS Software are affected by the vulnerability described in this security advisory.      In order to exploit this vulnerability an attacker would need to enable the FTP service and Safelist/Blocklist (SLBL) service on the affected system, rely on the fact that these services are already enabled or convince the system administrator to at least temporarily enable them.       **Note:** The two services do not have to be enabled at the same time in order for the attack to succeed.      To determine whether the FTP service is actively listening for new connections use the **netstat** command from the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco ESA or Cisco SMA and verify that TCP port 21 is in the LISTEN state.      The following example shows a Cisco ESA with the FTP service active (in the LISTEN state):    ```   ciscoesa> netstatChoose the information you want to display:1. List of active sockets.2. State of network interfaces.3. Contents of routing tables.4. Size of the listen queues.5. Packet traffic information.[1]> 1. IPv4 only.2. IPv6 only.[1]> Show network addresses as numbers? [N]> yAvoid truncating addresses? [N]> Active Internet connections (including servers)Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address       (state)tcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.443      *.*                    LISTENtcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.80       *.*                    LISTENtcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.25       *.*                    LISTENtcp4       0      0 172.18.254.17.21       *.*                    LISTEN   ```    **Note:** TCP port 21 is the default port for the FTP service; however, this is configurable at the time the service is activated. Customer should review all open ports to determine whether the FTP service has been enabled on a different port.   The FTP service may be enabled by default on some version of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA and Cisco SMA.      To determine whether the SLBL service is enabled, use the **slblconfig** command. The following example shows a Cisco ESA with the SLBL service enabled.    ```   ciscoesa> slblconfigEnd-User Safelist/Blocklist: Enabled[...]    ``` **Note:** The SLBL service is not enabled by default.Determining the Running Software Version To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS   Software is running on a Cisco ESA, administrators can issue the **version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.6.2-201:  ```   ciscoesa> versionCurrent Version===============Product: Cisco IronPort X1070 Messaging Gateway(tm) ApplianceModel: X1070Version: 7.6.2-201[...]   ```  To determine whether a vulnerable version of Cisco AsyncOS   Software is running on an Cisco Content SMA, administrators can issue the **version** command. The following example shows a device running Cisco IronPort AsyncOS Software version 7.9.1-039:  ```   ciscosma> versionCurrent Version===============Product: Cisco IronPort M670 Security Management(tm) ApplianceModel: M670Version: 7.9.1-039   ``` Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * The Cisco Email Security Appliance provides email management and   protection combining antispam, antivirus, and encryption technologies.      The Cisco Content Security Management Appliance consolidates policy and   run-time data in a single management interface, providing a centralized   platform for all reporting and auditing for Cisco Email and Web Security   Appliances.      A vulnerability in the End User Safelist/Blocklist (SLBL)   function of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance and Cisco Content Security Management Appliance could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected system.      The   vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the SLBL database file.   An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by substituting a valid   SLBL database file with a tampered file. The tampered file could contain   shell code that would be executed by the affected system when a specific   event is triggered (for example, when a new email is received that   triggers the SLBL check). To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have the FTP and SLBL services enabled, at least temporarily, and have valid credentials to upload the tampered   SLBL database file via FTP.       An exploit could allow the attacker to execute   arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the *root*   user.      This vulnerability is documented by Cisco bug ID [CSCug79377](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug79377) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco ESA and [CSCug80118](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug80118) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) for Cisco Content SMA. This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2119.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability. Disabling the FTP service will reduce the exposure to this vulnerability because it could prevent replacing the SLBL database file with a malicious one.      To disable the FTP service via the GUI, navigate to **Network > IP Interfaces**. For each interfaces click on the interface name and uncheck FTP check box in the services area of the Edit window. Alternatively, the CLI can be used. To disable the FTP service via the CLI, use the **interfaceconfig** command and choose to **EDIT** the interfaces configuration. When prompted, type *N* to disable the FTP service and commit the changes using the **commit** command. The following example shows how to disable the FTP service on Cisco ESA:  ```   ciscoesa> interfaceconfigCurrently configured interfaces:1.
