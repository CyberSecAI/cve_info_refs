Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-2892:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `get_answer` function within the `mmsh.c` file of the `libmms` library. This occurs when processing MMS over HTTP (MMSH) messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. The buffer used to store the server response in the `get_answer` function has a static size which can be overflowed by a long line in the MMSH response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running the vulnerable `libmms` library.

**Attack vectors:**
- A remote attacker sends a specially crafted, overly long MMSH response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted MMSH response to a system using the vulnerable version of `libmms`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an overly long line in an MMSH server response. The buffer which has a static size (`BUF_SIZE`) gets overflowed.
- The fix involves addressing the heap memory overrun in the `get_answer()` function.
- Affected versions of `libmms` are older than 0.6.4.
- Multiple distributions were affected including Debian, openSUSE and Gentoo.
