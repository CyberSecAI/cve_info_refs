# CSRF and stored XSS in Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin (WordPress plugin)

---

*From*: dxw Security <security () dxw com>

*Date*: Fri, 11 Apr 2014 12:58:02 +0000

---

```
Details
================
Software: Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin
Version: 5.0.3
Homepage: <http://wordpress.org/plugins/quick-pagepost-redirect-plugin/>
Advisory ID: dxw-1970-1091
CVE: CVE-2014-2598
CVSS: 6.8 (Medium; AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)

Description
================
CSRF and stored XSS in Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin

Vulnerability
================
This plugin is vulnerable to a combination CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be persuaded to visit a
URL of the attacker’s choosing (via spear phishing for instance), the attacker can insert arbitrary JavaScript into an
admin page. Once that occurs the admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do
such as create/delete posts, create new admin users, or even exploit vulnerabilities in other plugins.

Proof of concept
================
Use the following form to introduce potentially malicious JavaScript:
<form method=\"POST\" action=\"<http://localhost/wp-admin/admin.php?page=redirect-updates\">;>
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"quickppr_redirects[request][]\" value=\"&quot;>&lt;script>alert(1)&lt;/script>\">
  <input type=\"text\" name=\"quickppr_redirects[destination][]\" value=\"[http://dxw.com/\"](http://dxw.com/%5C%22);>
  <Input type=\"text\" name=\"submit_301\" value=\"1\">
  <input type=\"submit\">
</form>

Mitigations
================
Upgrade to version 5.0.5 or later.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CSRF and stored XSS in Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin

## Vulnerability

Last revised: March 24, 2014

This plugin is vulnerable to a combination CSRF/XSS attack meaning that if an admin user can be persuaded to visit a URL of the attacker’s choosing (via spear phishing for instance), the attacker can insert arbitrary JavaScript into an admin page. Once that occurs the admin’s browser can be made to do almost anything the admin user could typically do such as create/delete posts, create new admin users, or even exploit vulnerabilities in other plugins.

Current state:
 Fixed

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Quick Redirects are designed to be quick and simple to add. You do not need to have an existing page or post set up to add one. You just put the Request URL and the Destination URL and the plugin will redirect it. This type of redirect is great for fixing typos when a page was created, redirecting old URLs to a new URL so there is no 404, and to redirect links from an old site that has been converted to WordPress.

#### INDIVIDUAL REDIRECTS (for existing pages/posts)

For pages/posts that already exist, the plugin adds an option meta box to the edit screen where you can specify the redirect location and type (301, 302 or meta). This type of redirect is useful for many things, including menu items, duplicate posts, or just redirecting a page to a different URL or location on your existing site.

For best results use some form of WordPress Permalink structure. If you have other Redirect plugins installed, it is recommended that you use only one redirect plugin or they may conflict with each other or one may take over before the other can do its job.

#### What You CAN Do (aka, Features):

* Works with WordPress Nav Menus
* Works with WordPress Custom Post Types (select setting on options page)
* You can set a redirected page or menu item to open in a new window (Quick Redirects require **Use jQuery?** option to be set)
* You can add a *rel=”nofollow”* attribute to the page or menu item link for the redirect (Quick Redirects require **Use jQuery?** option to be set)
* You can completely re-write the URL for the redirect so it takes the place of the original URL (rewrite the href link)
* You can redirect without needing to create a Page or Post using Quick Redirects. This is useful for sites that were converted to WordPress and have old links that create 404 errors (see FAQs for more information).
* Destination URL can be to another WordPress page/post or any other website with an external URL.
* Request URL can be a full URL path, the post or page ID, permalink or page slug.
* Option Screen to set global overrides like turning off all redirects at once, setting a global destination link, make all redirects open in a new window, etc.
* View a summary of all redirected pages/posts, custom post types and Quick Redirects that are currently set up.
* Plugin Clean up functions for those who decide they may want to remove all plugin data on uninstall.
* Import/Export of redirects for backup, or to add bulk Quick Redirects.
* Built-in FAQs/Help feed that can be updated daily with relevant questions.
* Optional column for list pages to easily show if a page/post has a redirect set up and where it will redirect to.
* Helper functions for adding or deleting redirects programmatically (see ‘filters-hooks-helper\_functions.txt’ file in plugin folder for help and usage).

#### What You CANNOT Do:

* This plugin does not have wild-card redirect features.
* This plugin DOES NOT modify the .htaccess file. It works using the WordPress function wp\_redirect(), which is a form of PHP header location redirect.
* You cannot redirect the Home (Posts) page – unless you set a page as the home page and redirect that.
* If your theme uses some form of custom layout or functionality, some features may not work like open on a new window or no follow functionality UNLESS you have the **Use jQuery?** option to set.

This plugin is not compatible with WordPress versions less than 4.0. Requires PHP 5.2+.

**PLEASE NOTE:** A new page or post needs to be Published in order for Page/Post redirect to happen for Individual Redirects (existing page is not necessary for Quick Redirects). It WILL work on a DRAFT Status Post/Page ONLY, and I mean ONLY, if the Post/Page has FIRST been Published and the re-saved as a Draft. This does not apply to Quick Redirects.

#### TROUBLESHOOTING:

* To include custom post types, check the setting on the plugin option page – and you also can hide it from post types you don’t want it on.
* If you experience jQuery conflicts with the plugin, try turning off the **Use jQuery?** setting in the options page. BUT, please note that if this option if off, the new window and no follow functionality may be inconsistent (this mainly depends on how your theme is set up)
* If you check the box for “Show Redirect URL below” on the edit page, please note that you MUST use the full URL in the Redirect URL box. If you do not, you may experience some odd links and 404 pages, as this option changes the link for the page/post to the EXACT URL you enter in that field. (i.e., if you enter ‘2’ in the field, it will redirect to ‘http://2’ which is not the same as ‘http://yoursite.com/?p=2’).
* If your browser tells you that your are in an infinite loop, check to make sure you do not have pages redirecting to another page that redirects back to the initial page. That WILL cause an infinite loop.
* If you are using the Quick Redirects method to do your redirects, try to use Request URLs that start with a ‘/’ and are relative to the root (i.e., ‘http://mysite.com/test/’ should be set to ‘/test/’ for the request field).
* If your site uses mixes SSL, use relative links whenever possible (i.e., ‘/my-page/’). The plugin is designed to detect the incoming protocol and try to apply the appropriate protocol to the destination URL.
* Links in page/post content and links that are created using get\_permalink() or the\_permalink() will not open in a new window or add the rel=nofollow UNLESS you have the **Use jQuery?** option set.
* If your page or post is not redirecting, this is most likely because something else like the theme functions file or another plugin is outputting the header BEFORE the plugin can perform the redirect. This can be tested by turning off all plugins except the Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin and testing if the redirect works. Many times a plugin or bad code is the culprit.
* We try to test the plugin in many popular themes and alongside popular plugins. In our experience, (with exception to a few bugs from time to time) many times another plugin is the cause of the issues – or a customized theme. If you do notice a problem, please let us know at info@anadnet.com – along with the WP version, theme you are using and plugins you have installed – and we will try to troubleshoot the problem.

## FAQ

\*\* SEE A LIST OF MORE UP TO DATE FAQS IN THE PLUGIN MENU ITSELF \*\*

### Why is my Page/Post not redirecting?

FIRST – make sure it is active if using Individual Redirects (set up on the edit page for a post or page). Then, check to make sure the global option to turn off all redirects is not checked (in the plugin options).

SECOND – if you are using Quick Redirects, try using links relative to the root (so ‘http://mysite.com/contact/’ would be ‘/contact/’ if using the root path). If your site is in a sub-folder (set in Settings/General), do not use the sub-folder in the root path as it is already taken into consideration by WordPress.

NEXT – clear your site’s cache files if you are using a caching plugin/theme. You may also need to clear your browser cache and internet files if you use caching – the browser WILL hold cached versions of a page and not redirect if there was no redirect in the cached version.

FINALLY – if you are not using a permalink structure of some sort, it is recommended that you set up at least a basic one. Redirects without a permalink structure can be inconsistant.

If your page or post is still not redirecting, then it is most likely because something else like the theme functions file or another plugin is outputting the header BEFORE the plugin can perform the redirect. This can be tested by turning off all plugins except the Quick Page/Post Redirect Plugin and testing if the redirect works. many time a plugin or bad code is the culprit – or the redirect is just simply turned off.

We have tested the plugin in dozens of themes and a whole lot more plugins. In our experience, (with exception to a few bugs) many times another plugin or the theme scripting is the problem. If you do notice a problem, please let us know at info@anadnet.com – along with the WP version, theme you are using and plugins you have installed – and we will try to troubleshoot the problem.

### Should I use a full URL with http:// or https:// ?

Yes, you can, but you do not always need to. If you are redirecting to an external URL, then yes. If you are just redirecting to another page or post on your site, then no, it is not needed. When in doubt, use the entire URL. For Quick Redirects, it is recommended that you use relative URLs whenever possible.

### Can I do a permanent 301 Redirect?

Yes. You can perform a 301 Permanent Redirect. Additionally, you can select a 302 Temporary or a 307 Temporary redirect or a Meta redirect. Quick Redirects are always 301 unless you override them with a filter.

### Is the plugin SEO friendly?

Yes it is.

The plugin uses standard redirect status methods to redirect the URLs. SEO crawlers use the status code to determine if a page request is available, moved or if there is some other error.

If you do not want a search engine to follow a Redirect URL, use the No Follow option to add ‘rel=”nofollow”‘ to the link.

### If I redirect a page that has a good Ranking in Google, will I lose that Ranking?

The answer is dependent on two things:

1. What type of redirect it is
2. What content is on the redirected page.

If you use a redirect of 301 AND the content on the destination URL is the same as the original page (just a different URL), then allof the ranking and ‘link juice’, as they say, will stay with the page.

If you use a redirect of 301 and the content is different, then it will be indexed and ranked accordingly, as any other page would.

If you use a 302 redirect, the search engines will not change anything, but also index the destination page as it would any other page.

### Do I need to have a Page or Post Created to redirect?

No. There is a Quick Redirects feature that allows you to create a redirect for any URL on your site. This is VERY helpful when you move an old site to WordPress and have old links that need to go some place new. For example,

If you had a link on a site that went to http://yoursite.com/aboutme.html you can now redirect that to http://yoursite.com/about/ without needing to edit the htaccess file. You simply add the old URL (/aboutme.html) and tell it you want to go to the new one (/about/). Simple as that.

The functionality is located in the QUICK REDIRECTS menu. The old URL goes in the Request field and the to new URL goes in the Destination field. Simple and Quick!

### Does the Page/Post need to be Published to redirect?

YES… and NO… The redirect will always work on a Published Post/Page. For it to work correctly on a Post/Page in DRAFT status, you need to fist publish the page, then re-save it as a draft. If you don’t follow that step, you will get a 404 error.

### Can I add ‘rel=”nofollow” attribute to the redirect link?

YES, you can add a ‘ rel=”nofollow” ‘ attribute for the redirect link. Simply check the “add rel=nofollow” box when setting up the redirect on the page/post edit page. Note – this option is only available for the Quick Redirects method when the ‘Use jQuery?’ functionality is enabled in the settings and you select the ‘NF’ box for the corresponding redirect.

### Can I make the redirect open in a new window?

YES, you can make the redirect link open in a new window. Simply check the “Open in a new window” box when setting up the individual redirect on the page/post edit page. Note – this option is only available for the Quick Redirects method when the ‘Use jQuery?’ functionality is enabled in the settings and you select the ‘NW’ box for the corresponding redirect.

### I still can’t get the OPEN IN NEW WINDOW option to work… why?

First, make sure you have the ‘Use jQuery?’ option set in the options page. This funcitonality drastically increases the plugin’s ability to add the correct properties and attributes to the links to make them work as desired.

If you cannot us this option (because of a conflict with another script), then you may only have limited success with this feature.

The reason – some themes put custom links in the menu, like RSS and other similar items. Many times (an this is usually the main reason why), they do not use the WP hook to add the menu item to the list – they literally just put it there. Unless the theme uses the internal WordPress hooks to call the menu, redirects, open in a new window and rel=nofollow features just will not work.

ADDITIONALLY – Links in page/post content and Permalinks will not open in a new window or add the rel=nofollow. That is because the theme template actually sets up the links by calling “the\_permalink()” function so add these elements is not consistently possible so it has been excluded from the functionality. The links will still redirect just fine but without that feature.

### I want to just have the link for the redirecting page/post show the new redirect link in the link, not the old one, can I do that?

YES, you can hide the original page link and have it replaced with the redirect link. Any place the theme calls either “wp\_page\_links”, “post\_links” or “page\_links” functions, the plugin can replace the original link with the new one. Simply check the “Show Redirect URL” box when setting up the redirect on the page/post edit page.

Note – This option is available for the Quick Redirects only with the ‘Use jQuery?’ option enabled.

### I have Business Cards/Postcards/Ads that say my website is http://something.com/my-name/ or http://something.com/my-product/, but it should be a different page, can I set that up with this?

YES! Just set up a Quick Redirect (see above) and set the Request URL to `/my-name/` or `/my-product/` and the Destination URL to the place you want it to go. The destination doesn’t even need to be on the same site – it can go anywhere you want it to go!

### What the heck is a 301 or 302 redirect anyway?

Good question! The number corresponds with the header code that is returned to the browser when the page is first accessed. A good page, meaning something was found, returns a 200 status code and that tells the browser to go ahead and keep loading the content for the page. If nothing is found a 404 error is returned (and we have ALL seen these – usually it is a bad link or a page was moved). There are many other types of codes, but those are the most common.

The 300+ range of codes in the header tells the browser (and search engine spider) that the original page has moved to a new location – this can be just a new file name a new folder or a completely different site.

A 301 code means that you want to tell the browser (or Google, bing, etc.) that your new page has permanently moved to a new location. This is great for search engines because it lets them know that there was a page there once, but now go to the new place to get it – and they update there old link to is so future visitors will not have to go through the same process.

A 302 or 307 code tell the browser that the file was there but TEMPORARILY it can be found at a new location. This will tell the search engines to KEEP the old link in place because SOME day it will be back at the same old link. There is only a slight difference between a 302 and a 307 status. Truth is, 302 is more widely used, so unless you know why you need a 307, stick with a 302.

### So, which one do I use?

Easiest way to decide is this: If you want the page to permanently change to a new spot, use 301. If you are editing the page or post and only want it to be down for a few hours, minutes, days or weeks and plan on putting it back with the same link as before, then us 302. If you are having trouble with the redirects, use a `meta` redirect. The meta redirect actually starts to load the page as a 200 good status, then redirects using a meta redirect tag.

Still not sure? Try 302 for now – at least until you have a little time to read up on the subject.

### If I have a redirect in place, can I view the original page during testing?

Yes, use the URL as normal, and add `?action=no-redirect` to the query data (or `&action=no-redirect` if there is already query data present).

For example. If you set up a redirect for the page `http://mysite.com/old-page/` and you want to see the page (and not have it redirect on you so you can look at it), type the URL as `http://mysite.com/old-page/?action=no-redirect` and it will load like there is no redirect present.

### That’s all the FAQs you have?

NO it isn’t! Check the plugin FAQs/Help page for a more up to date list of Frequently Asked Questions. The plugin now has a live feed of FAQs that can be updated regularly. If you have something you think we should add, please let us know.

Do not install this plugin, it inject adverts into your website. Looking through the code, it even intentionally hides them from site Admins. Completely malicious and should be banned.

After updating plugins today, Wordpress spotted this file was different to that claimed in the repository. It seems to have updated itself to allow spam/adware injection to the website! I used Wordfence to roll back to an ‘official’ version, but guess it will try to re-install its broken version so I’ll be looking for a new redirect tool.

Don’t use this plugin. As others mention here, it’s injecting spam into websites. It should be removed from WordPress’ repository.

Recent update allowed advertising links to be injected into our site without our knowledge. It took a lot of digging around to find that this plugin was the culprit.
Very bad black hat and shady behavior from the developers here. Avoid.

## Changelog

#### TODO

* THIS SECTION IS JUST TO KEEP TRACK OF TODO ITEMS FOR FUTURE UPDATES.

* **Update:** Fixed some spelling errors (thanks to those of you who pointed them out).
* **Update:** Updated English Translations.

#### 5.1.3

* **Update:** Updated English Translations.
* **Bug Fix:** Fixed Meta redirect functions so browsers that no longer allow refresh redirects can still use Meta redirects (i.e., Firefox, Edge, some IE).
* **Bug Fix:** Fixed Function for Individual Redirects for New Window functionality. Was not working unless both No Follow and New Window were selected.
* **TODO:** Add New Window and No Follow to links where the URL has been rewritten. Currently if you rewrite the URL neither will work as they are referenced with the original URL, not the rewrite.

#### 5.1.2

* **Update:** Updated English Translations.
* **Update:** Updated license.txt file (had wrong version of license).
* **Update:** Verified plugin for WordPress 4.3 compatibility.
* **Update:** Add check if current user can manage\_options when deleting All Redirects. Prevents logged in users without permissions from maliciously deleting redirects.
* **Update:** Minify JavaScript files for front-end and admin (non-minified files still remain in the file structure for reference).
* **Feature Addition:** Added experimental function to delete cache files (for W3 Total Cache, WP Super Cache and WP Fastest Cache) on functionality saves (add/remove redirects and options updates) to try to help some users resolve caching issues after an update with these plugins installed.
* **Feature Addition:** Added “helper” functions to allow for adding or deleting Quick and Individual Redirects programatically (see filters-hooks-helper\_functions.txt in plugin directory for more info).
* **Bug Fix:** Fix ajax function for Quick Redirect delete and save (if a redirect was deleted, anything below it would not be correctly referenced and deleting or editing would not work)
* **Bug Fix:** Fix to ‘rewrite URL’ jQuery function that was replacing text instead of HTML – thanks Leo Kerr leo@myelectriccar.com.au
* **TODO (Still):** Add Canonical Redirect filter to fix potential www/non-www redirect match problems.

#### 5.1.1

* Fix ‘array to string’ error message on Quick Redirect save – thanks Simon Codrington simon@webbird.com.au
* TODO: Add Canonical Redirect filter to fix potential www/non-www redirect match problems.
* Added Meta Redirect Options Page – this splits out Meta Options from the main options page.
* Added more enhanced meta redirect scripting to allow for tracking or other page content (including countdown if desired).
* Fixed Layout issues on Quick Redirect Page making it impossible to edit redirects in some cases.
* Fixed a few spelling errors.
