Package        : libgd2
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-2497 CVE-2014-9709
Debian Bug     : 744719

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libgd2, a graphics library:

CVE-2014-2497

    The gdImageCreateFromXpm() function would try to dereference a NULL
    pointer when reading an XPM file with a special color table. This
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
    crafted XPM files.

CVE-2014-9709

    Importing an invalid GIF file using the gdImageCreateFromGif() function
    would cause a read buffer overflow that could allow remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted GIF files.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-6.1+deb7u1.

For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.1.0-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.

## Synopsis

Moderate: php security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A1327)

## Topic

Updated php packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server. PHP's fileinfo module provides functions used to identify a
particular file according to the type of data contained by the file.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the File Information (fileinfo)
extension processed certain Pascal strings. A remote attacker able to make
a PHP application using fileinfo convert a specially crafted Pascal string
provided by an image file could cause that application to crash.
(CVE-2014-3478)

Multiple flaws were found in the File Information (fileinfo) extension
regular expression rules for detecting various files. A remote attacker
could use either of these flaws to cause a PHP application using fileinfo
to consume an excessive amount of CPU. (CVE-2014-3538)

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-1571 was incomplete; the File
Information (fileinfo) extension did not correctly parse certain Composite
Document Format (CDF) files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash
a PHP application using fileinfo via a specially crafted CDF file.
(CVE-2014-3587)

It was found that PHP's gd extension did not properly handle file names
with a null character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
make a PHP application access unexpected files and bypass intended file
system access restrictions. (CVE-2014-5120)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
file. (CVE-2014-2497)

Multiple buffer over-read flaws were found in the php\_parserr() function of
PHP. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly
use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP
application used the dns\_get\_record() function to perform a DNS query.
(CVE-2014-3597)

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

The CVE-2014-3478 issue was discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat
Product Security, the CVE-2014-3538 issue was discovered by Jan Kaluža of
the Red Hat Web Stack Team, and the CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by
David Kutálek of the Red Hat BaseOS QE.

All php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, the httpd daemon must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted CDF file,  which once inspected by the file utility of the victim would lead to file executable crash.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-15 11:15:14 UTC  ``` This CVE was assigned to an incorrect boundary check in the cdf_read_short_sector() function.  The issue was corrected as part of this upstream commit:  <https://github.com/file/file/commit/6d209c1c489457397a5763bca4b28e43aac90391#diff-0>  The boundary check was added as part of the [CVE-2012-1571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1571) fix (see [bug 805197](show_bug.cgi?id=805197 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2012-1571 file: out of bounds read in CDF parser")).  The [CVE-2014-0207](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0207) is really an incomplete / insufficient [CVE-2012-1571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1571) fix CVE and hence does not affected file packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and php53 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and php packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, which did not get the incomplete fix applied.  Future updates addressing [CVE-2012-1571](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-1571) will use complete fix.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c11)  Remi Collet    2014-05-22 14:07:29 UTC  ``` PHP upstream bug <https://bugs.php.net/67326>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c14)  Francisco Alonso    2014-06-30 06:11:20 UTC  ```  Created php tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1114441](show_bug.cgi?id=1114441 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0207 php: file: cdf_read_short_sector insufficient boundary check [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c15)  Francisco Alonso    2014-06-30 06:11:24 UTC  ```  Created file tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1114440](show_bug.cgi?id=1114440 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0207 file: cdf_read_short_sector insufficient boundary check [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1091842#c16)  Fedora Update System    2014-07-05 14:53:28 UTC  ``` file-5.19-1.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1098222#c0)  Francisco Alonso    2014-05-15 13:52:56 UTC  ``` It was discovered the original upstream fix for the [CVE-2013-7345](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-7345) issue ([bug 1079846](show_bug.cgi?id=1079846 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2013-7345 file: extensive backtracking in awk rule regular expression")) did not sufficiently address the problem.  A specially-crafted input file could still cause file to use an excessive amount of CPU time when trying to detect file type using awk regular expression rule.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1098222#c1)  Francisco Alonso    2014-05-22 12:47:18 UTC  ``` Patch proposed from Jan Kaluza:   0       search/16384    BEGIN >0      regex           =^\\s{0,100}BEGIN\\s{0,100}[{]  awk script text   Not fixed upstream yet.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1098222#c2)  Francisco Alonso    2014-05-23 07:40:49 UTC  ``` Acknowledgment:  Name: Jan Kaluža (Red Hat Web Stack Team)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1098222#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-28 07:31:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to Francisco Alonso from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1098222#c1)) > Patch proposed from Jan Kaluza: >  >  > 0       search/16384    BEGIN > >0      regex           =^\\s{0,100}BEGIN\\s{0,100}[{]  awk script text  This fix is also insufficient and easy to bypass.  The first rule can be satisfied by having BEGIN somewhere in the first 16384 bytes of the input, but in a way that it does not satisfy the regex of the subsequent rule, making the regex do the full exhaustive search.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1098222#c7)  Francisco Alonso    2014-05-29 08:32:01 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <https://github.com/file/file/commit/0b478f445b6b7540b58af5d1fe583fa9e48fd745>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1098222#c8)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2014-06-27 12:26:59 UTC  ``` Hi Francisco  Is the assignment [CVE-2014-0235](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0235) correct? On  <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0235>  apparently this is for Microsoft Internet Explorer 9.

I'm also wondering if the various gd-related issues in [Bug 12842](show_bug.cgi?id=12842 "RESOLVED FIXED - php: infinite recursion and OOB parsing PE files (CVE-2014-1943, CVE-2014-2270)") affect libgd in Mageia 4.

I've verified the vulnerability and the fix in gd in Mageia 3 and libgd in Mageia 4 and checked the fix into SVN.  All that should be needed now is adding the fix to php itself in Mageia 3 (testable with the php-gd package), which we can include in our next PHP update.

## Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin - January 2015

### Description

The Oracle Solaris Third Party Bulletin announces patches for one or more security vulnerabilities fixed in third party software that is included in Oracle Solaris distributions. Starting January 20, 2015, Third Party Bulletins are released on the same day when Oracle Critical Patch Updates are released. These bulletins will also be updated on the Tuesday closest to the 17th of the following two months after their release (i.e. the two months between the normal quarterly Critical Patch Update publication dates). In addition, Third Party Bulletins may also be updated for vulnerability fixes deemed too critical to wait for the next monthly update.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Third Party Bulletin fixes as soon as possible.**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Topic

Updated php54-php packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Exif extension. A specially crafted
JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the exif\_thumbnail()
function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3670)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the way PHP parsed DNS
responses. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could
use these flaws to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of a PHP application that uses the dns\_get\_record() function.
(CVE-2014-4049, CVE-2014-3597)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the File Information
(fileinfo) extension. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a
PHP application using fileinfo to consume an excessive amount of CPU and
possibly crash. (CVE-2013-7345, CVE-2014-0237, CVE-2014-0238,
CVE-2014-1943, CVE-2014-3538)

Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the File Information
(fileinfo) extension. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a
PHP application using fileinfo to crash. (CVE-2014-0207, CVE-2014-2270,
CVE-2014-3478, CVE-2014-3479, CVE-2014-3480, CVE-2014-3487, CVE-2014-3587,
CVE-2014-3710)

A type confusion issue was found in PHP's phpinfo() function. A malicious
script author could possibly use this flaw to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4721)

A type confusion issue was found in the SPL ArrayObject and
SPLObjectStorage classes' unserialize() method. A remote attacker able to
submit specially crafted input to a PHP application, which would then
unserialize this input using one of the aforementioned methods, could use
this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
that PHP application. (CVE-2014-3515)

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way custom objects were
unserialized. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
function could cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3669)

It was found that PHP's gd extension did not properly handle file names
with a null character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
make a PHP application access unexpected files and bypass intended file
system access restrictions. (CVE-2014-5120)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
file. (CVE-2014-2497)

A buffer over-read flaw was found in the way the DateInterval class parsed
interval specifications. An attacker able to make a PHP application parse a
specially crafted specification using DateInterval could possibly cause the
PHP interpreter to crash. (CVE-2013-6712)

An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way the xmlrpc extension parsed
dates in the ISO 8601 format. A specially crafted XML-RPC request or
response could possibly cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3668)

The CVE-2014-0207, CVE-2014-0237, CVE-2014-0238, CVE-2014-3478,
CVE-2014-3479, CVE-2014-3480, CVE-2014-3487, and CVE-2014-3710 issues were
discovered by Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security; the
CVE-2014-3538 issue was discovered by Jan Kaluža of the Red Hat Web Stack
Team; the CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by David Kutálek of Red Hat
BaseOS QE.

All php54-php users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, the httpd service must be restarted for the update to
take effect.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2012-1571 was incomplete; the File
Information (fileinfo) extension did not correctly parse certain Composite
Document Format (CDF) files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash
a PHP application using fileinfo via a specially crafted CDF file.
(CVE-2014-3587)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
file. (CVE-2014-2497)

Multiple buffer over-read flaws were found in the php\_parserr() function of
PHP. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly
use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP
application used the dns\_get\_record() function to perform a DNS query.
(CVE-2014-3597)

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

The CVE-2014-3597 issue was discovered by David Kutalek of the Red Hat
BaseOS QE.

 other images, flood fills, and write out the result as a PNG file.

 This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where PNG is

 one of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.

 .

 This is the full development version of the library, built with XPM

 (X pixmap) and fontconfig support.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-14 19:57:56 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the gdImageCreateFromXpm() function in libgd could dereference a NULL pointer, noting:  "The call to strlen() parses image.colorTable[i].c_color which is initialised as NULL if the particular color mapping uses a different key (such as monochrome/monovisual)."  This was reported against PHP, which includes an embedded copy of the gd library.  [CVE-2014-2497](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2497) was assigned to this issue [2].  [1] <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=66901> [2] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/580>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-14 20:03:40 UTC  ``` Note that the PHP bug includes a reproducer, but it does not seem to work with the versions I've tried (it notes version 5.4.17, I tried with 5.4.25 and 5.3.3):  $ echo '<?php print imagecreatefromxpm("monochrome-poc.xpm")."\n"; ?>'|php  Warning: imagecreatefromxpm(): 'monochrome-poc.xpm' is not a valid XPM file in - on line 1 $ file monochrome-poc.xpm monochrome-poc.xpm: X pixmap image text  It's possible that I did something wrong; I just cut-n-paste the reproducer from the upstream bug and I did not spend much time trying, so the bug is filed due to the CVE assignment.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c2)  Remi Collet    2014-03-15 16:20:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 874847](attachment.cgi?id=874847 "reproducer.xpm") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=874847&action=edit "reproducer.xpm") reproducer.xpm  This (correct) reproducer raise the segfault, tested with php 5.5.10 (and system gd 2.1).  php -r 'var_dump(imagecreatefromxpm("reproducer.xpm"));'   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-17 14:56:50 UTC  ``` Thanks, Remi.  That is perfect.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-17 16:13:29 UTC  ``` Based on this reproducer, this affects php53 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but not php (5.1) as it is not built with xpm support:  % echo "<?php var_dump(gd_info()); ?>"|php array(12) {   ["GD Version"]=>   string(27) "bundled (2.0.28 compatible)"   ["FreeType Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["FreeType Linkage"]=>   string(13) "with freetype"   ["T1Lib Support"]=>   bool(false)   ["GIF Read Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["GIF Create Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["JPG Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["PNG Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["WBMP Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["XPM Support"]=>   bool(false)   ["XBM Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["JIS-mapped Japanese Font Support"]=>   bool(false) } % rpm -q php-gd php-gd-5.1.6-43.el5_10   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-24 16:55:30 UTC  ``` Summary of what is affected:  - php in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not affected (XPM support is disabled as noted in [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c4)) - php53 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, php in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, php54-php in Red Hat Software Collections 1, and php packages in Fedora are affected  - gd in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and gd packages in Fedora are affected  - libwmf packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and libwmf packages in Fedora are not affected.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 libwmf packages have bundled gd built without xpm support.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1120259#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-07-16 14:48:03 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that PHP incorrectly handled certain ArrayIterators.  A local attacker, in particular shared hosting environments relying on PHP features such as open_basedir, safe_mode, disable_functions, and similar), could use this flaw to cause PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of service.  [1] <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=67539>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1120259#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-07-16 14:55:44 UTC  ``` I'm not convinced this is something that should have ever gotten a CVE.  There is a reproducer noted in the original bug report, and in order to see anything interesting, you need to run it under valgrind, but even then with a certain environment variable set (that twiddles with memory handling?  It's USE_ZEND_ALLOC=0).  When run without valgrind, I don't see the script dying, and I tried with php53 on RHEL5 and php on RHEL6.  With php on RHEL7 is does complain that it ran out of memory (Allowed memory exhausted).  But the upstream bug report indicates:  """ Please use [CVE-2014-4698](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-4698), the bug is in fact exploitable - not sure why was it made public before release of a patched version.  It's not remotely exploitable, however, shared environments relying on PHP security features (open_basedir, safe_mode in older PHPs, disable_functions and similar) are affected. We're ready to provide PoC is needed. """  So you run a custom PHP script to cause PHP to crash, locally, from the command-line.  You can do that a hundred and one other ways too.  Perhaps I'm missing something?   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1120259#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-07-16 14:57:39 UTC  ``` Oh, forgot to note the fix:  <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=22882a9d89712ff2b6ebc20a689a89452bba4dcd>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1120259#c4)  Remi Collet    2014-09-10 05:48:33 UTC  ``` rhel5/php is not affected (PHP 5.1 doesn't have the unserialize method for the ArrayIterator class)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1120259#c9)  Martin Prpič    2014-09-25 12:16:17 UTC  ``` IssueDescription:  A use-after-free flaw was found in the way PHP handled certain ArrayIterators.

## Topic

Updated php55-php packages that fix multiple security issues are now
available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Important security
impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give
detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the
CVE links in the References section.

## Description

PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache
HTTP Server.

A buffer overflow flaw was found in the Exif extension. A specially crafted
JPEG or TIFF file could cause a PHP application using the exif\_thumbnail()
function to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3670)

Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the way PHP parsed DNS
responses. A malicious DNS server or a man-in-the-middle attacker could
use these flaws to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of a PHP application that uses the dns\_get\_record() function.
(CVE-2014-4049, CVE-2014-3597)

Multiple denial of service flaws were found in the File Information
(fileinfo) extension. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a
PHP application using fileinfo to consume an excessive amount of CPU and
possibly crash. (CVE-2014-0237, CVE-2014-0238, CVE-2014-3538)

Multiple boundary check flaws were found in the File Information (fileinfo)
extension. A remote attacker could use these flaws to cause a PHP
application using fileinfo to crash. (CVE-2014-0207, CVE-2014-3478,
CVE-2014-3479, CVE-2014-3480, CVE-2014-3487, CVE-2014-3587, CVE-2014-3710)

A type confusion issue was found in PHP's phpinfo() function. A malicious
script author could possibly use this flaw to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4721)

A type confusion issue was found in the SPL ArrayObject and
SPLObjectStorage classes' unserialize() method. A remote attacker able to
submit specially crafted input to a PHP application, which would then
unserialize this input using one of the aforementioned methods, could use
this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
that PHP application. (CVE-2014-3515)

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the way PHP handled certain Standard
PHP Library (SPL) Iterators and ArrayIterators. A malicious script author
could possibly use either of these flaws to disclose certain portions of
server memory. (CVE-2014-4670, CVE-2014-4698)

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way custom objects were
unserialized. Specially crafted input processed by the unserialize()
function could cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3669)

It was found that PHP's gd extension did not properly handle file names
with a null character. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to
make a PHP application access unexpected files and bypass intended file
system access restrictions. (CVE-2014-5120)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the gdImageCreateFromXpm()
function of PHP's gd extension. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
crash a PHP application using gd via a specially crafted X PixMap (XPM)
file. (CVE-2014-2497)

An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way the xmlrpc extension parsed
dates in the ISO 8601 format. A specially crafted XML-RPC request or
response could possibly cause a PHP application to crash. (CVE-2014-3668)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-14 19:57:56 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that the gdImageCreateFromXpm() function in libgd could dereference a NULL pointer, noting:  "The call to strlen() parses image.colorTable[i].c_color which is initialised as NULL if the particular color mapping uses a different key (such as monochrome/monovisual)."  This was reported against PHP, which includes an embedded copy of the gd library.  [CVE-2014-2497](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2497) was assigned to this issue [2].  [1] <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=66901> [2] <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/580>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-14 20:03:40 UTC  ``` Note that the PHP bug includes a reproducer, but it does not seem to work with the versions I've tried (it notes version 5.4.17, I tried with 5.4.25 and 5.3.3):  $ echo '<?php print imagecreatefromxpm("monochrome-poc.xpm")."\n"; ?>'|php  Warning: imagecreatefromxpm(): 'monochrome-poc.xpm' is not a valid XPM file in - on line 1 $ file monochrome-poc.xpm monochrome-poc.xpm: X pixmap image text  It's possible that I did something wrong; I just cut-n-paste the reproducer from the upstream bug and I did not spend much time trying, so the bug is filed due to the CVE assignment.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c2)  Remi Collet    2014-03-15 16:20:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 874847](attachment.cgi?id=874847 "reproducer.xpm") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=874847&action=edit "reproducer.xpm") reproducer.xpm  This (correct) reproducer raise the segfault, tested with php 5.5.10 (and system gd 2.1).  php -r 'var_dump(imagecreatefromxpm("reproducer.xpm"));'   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-17 14:56:50 UTC  ``` Thanks, Remi.  That is perfect.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-17 16:13:29 UTC  ``` Based on this reproducer, this affects php53 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, but not php (5.1) as it is not built with xpm support:  % echo "<?php var_dump(gd_info()); ?>"|php array(12) {   ["GD Version"]=>   string(27) "bundled (2.0.28 compatible)"   ["FreeType Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["FreeType Linkage"]=>   string(13) "with freetype"   ["T1Lib Support"]=>   bool(false)   ["GIF Read Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["GIF Create Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["JPG Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["PNG Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["WBMP Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["XPM Support"]=>   bool(false)   ["XBM Support"]=>   bool(true)   ["JIS-mapped Japanese Font Support"]=>   bool(false) } % rpm -q php-gd php-gd-5.1.6-43.el5_10   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-24 16:55:30 UTC  ``` Summary of what is affected:  - php in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not affected (XPM support is disabled as noted in [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c4)) - php53 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, php in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, php54-php in Red Hat Software Collections 1, and php packages in Fedora are affected  - gd in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and gd packages in Fedora are affected  - libwmf packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and libwmf packages in Fedora are not affected.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 libwmf packages have bundled gd built without xpm support.  The libwmf packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and later (including Fedora) have the whole gdImageCreateFromXpm() disabled (#if 0) via the libwmf-0.2.8.4-reducesymbols.patch:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/libwmf.git/tree/libwmf-0.2.8.4-reducesymbols.patch?id=916cd2c#n467>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-24 19:37:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of gd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-24 19:39:34 UTC  ``` This issue has not been fixed in libgd version bundled in PHP.  It still seems to affect current upstream libgd 2.1.0, and there's no libgd upstream fix yet either.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-24 19:40:32 UTC  ```  Created gd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1080168](show_bug.cgi?id=1080168 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-2497 gd: NULL pointer dereference in gdImageCreateFromXpm() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-24 19:40:37 UTC  ```  Created php tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1080167](show_bug.cgi?id=1080167 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-2497 php: gd: NULL pointer dereference in gdImageCreateFromXpm() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c15)  Remi Collet    2014-08-04 08:54:34 UTC  ``` GD upstream fix:   <https://bitbucket.org/libgd/gd-libgd/commits/463c3bd09bfe8e924e19acad7a2a6af16953a704>  PHP upstream fix (will be in 5.4.32, 5.5.16)  <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=cf4753691dc55999373d1c576f62ecb298723420>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1076676#c16)  Fedora Update System    2014-08-15 02:31:56 UTC  ``` gd-2.1.0-6.fc20 has been pushed to the Fedora 20 stable repository.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
