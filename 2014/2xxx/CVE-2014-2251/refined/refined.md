Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2014-2251:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient entropy in the random number generator used for authenticating the integrated web server of the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 PLCs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient entropy in the random number generator. This makes it easier for attackers to predict or brute-force session IDs or other security tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can hijack web sessions over the network without authentication. This allows the attacker to potentially gain control over the PLC's web interface, modify settings, or disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack. The vulnerability is exploitable via network communication with the PLC's integrated web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected device's web server (ports 80/TCP or 443/TCP).
- No authentication is required, but some user interaction (likely to establish a legitimate web session) may be needed for the attacker to later hijack the session.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy.
- The Siemens advisory assigns a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8.
- The advisory notes this vulnerability can lead to a loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.
