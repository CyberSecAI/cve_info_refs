        "type": "Impact",
        "description": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. On Windows clients, this is rated as critical, while on Windows servers, it is rated as moderate. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of an affected system."
