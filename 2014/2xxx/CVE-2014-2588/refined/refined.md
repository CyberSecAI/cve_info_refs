Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-2588:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause lies in insufficient input validation and access controls within the McAfee Asset Manager v6.6 application.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Authenticated Arbitrary File Read:**  The application's report download functionality allows an authenticated, unprivileged user to download arbitrary files from the server by manipulating the `reportFileName` parameter in the `/servlet/downloadReport` endpoint. This vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input, which makes it susceptible to directory traversal attacks.
    *   **Authenticated SQL Injection:** The application's audit report generation feature is vulnerable to SQL injection.  An authenticated, unprivileged user can inject malicious SQL code via the `user` parameter in the `/jsp/reports/ReportsAudit.jsp` endpoint. This is due to the application's failure to properly sanitize user-provided input within SQL queries.
   *   **Unauthenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** McAfee Cloud SSO is vulnerable to an unauthenticated XSS in the authentication audit form. While not explicitly detailed in the provided content beyond a reference to a tweet, this indicates a lack of input sanitization on the SSO component.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing credentials, configuration data, or other confidential information.
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to potentially read database contents (including user data), modify data, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
    *   **XSS:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Read:**  The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to the `/servlet/downloadReport` endpoint with a manipulated `reportFileName` parameter containing directory traversal sequences (`../`).
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to the `/jsp/reports/ReportsAudit.jsp` endpoint, injecting SQL code within the `user` parameter.
    *   **XSS:** The attacker injects malicious Javascript code into the authentication audit form which is executed in the victim's browser.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Read:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the McAfee Asset Manager application. The attacker does not need any special privileges or elevated access beyond a regular user account.
    *   **SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the McAfee Asset Manager application. The attacker does not need any special privileges or elevated access beyond a regular user account.
    *  **XSS:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the XSS vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, including specific HTTP request examples.
*   The vulnerabilities are found in McAfee Asset Manager v6.6 and McAfee Cloud SSO.
*   The exploit details were publicly disclosed on March 18, 2014.
