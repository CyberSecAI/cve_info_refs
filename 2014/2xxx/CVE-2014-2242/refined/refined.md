Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2242:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's insufficient handling of SVG files. Specifically, it does not properly restrict the use of potentially unsafe XML namespaces, such as the W3C XHTML namespace, within uploaded SVG images. This allows for the inclusion of malicious code within the SVG.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious scripts into SVG files, leading to XSS attacks. This is achieved by using the improperly handled namespaces to include HTML elements.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** MediaWiki was not validating or sanitizing XML namespaces within SVG files, specifically not blocking namespaces like the W3C XHTML namespace that can be used to execute script when rendered by the browser.
*   **Lack of Namespace Whitelisting:**  The system lacked a strict whitelist of allowed namespaces, which could have prevented the use of the malicious W3C XHTML namespace.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when the user views a maliciously crafted SVG file uploaded to the MediaWiki site. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Cookie theft
    *   Defacement of the site
    *   Redirecting to malicious sites
    *   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SVG Upload:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious code. This can be done through the standard file upload mechanisms provided by MediaWiki.
*   **Malicious SVG Content:**  The attacker crafts the SVG file to include an iframe with a srcdoc attribute and using a non-whitelisted namespace (such as the W3C XHTML namespace), to trigger the XSS vulnerability when the file is rendered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **MediaWiki Access:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the MediaWiki instance. This typically requires an authenticated account but could be available to anonymous users depending on the MediaWiki configuration.
*   **Knowledge of SVG and XSS:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SVG structure and the ability to craft malicious SVG code with iframes and HTML attributes leveraging namespaces to execute script.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The fix involved implementing a whitelist of allowed XML namespaces for SVG uploads.
* The patch also explicitly disallows iframe elements within the SVG, providing additional protection.
* The vulnerability was reported by Mario Gomes to Mozilla.
* The fix was deployed to the MediaWiki cluster.
