# Title: Path Traversal Vulnerability

# Vendor Homepage: http://www.belkin.com
# Firmware Tested: 1.00.08, 1.00.09
# CVE: 2014-2962

Description:
Belkin N150 wireless router firmware versions 1.00.07 and earlier contain a
path traversal vulnerability through the built-in web interface. The
webproc cgi
module accepts a getpage parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as
input. The web server runs with root privileges by default, allowing a
malicious attacker to read any file on the system.

A patch was released by Belkin but that is still vulnerable.

POC:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Belkin N150 path traversal vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#774788

Original Release Date: 2014-06-18 | Last Revised: 2015-09-29

---

### Overview

Belkin N150 wireless routers contain a path traversal vulnerability.

### Description

| [**CWE-22**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)**: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')** - CVE-2014-2962  Belkin N150 wireless router firmware versions 1.00.07 and earlier contain a path traversal vulnerability through the built-in web interface. The webproc cgi module accepts a getpage parameter which takes an unrestricted file path as input. The web server runs with root privileges by default, allowing a malicious attacker to read any file on the system. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker that is connected to the router's LAN may be able to read critical system files on the router. |
| --- |

### Solution

| The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. The vendor had previously indicated that the vulnerability was resolved in [firmware version 1.00.08](http://cache-www.belkin.com/support/dl/F9K1009_WW_1.00.08.bin); however, recent reports indicate that firmware version 1.00.08 failed to address the issue and that version 1.00.09 is vulnerable as well. Users should consider the following workaround: |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Ensure that appropriate firewall rules are in place to restrict access to port 80/tcp from external untrusted sources. |
