  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The NFS dissector in Wireshark has a memory corruption vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory corruption vulnerability in the NFS dissector.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malformed NFS packet, either captured from the wire or read from a malicious trace file, could cause Wireshark to crash and potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running Wireshark.",
  "Attack vectors": "Maliciously crafted network packets or malformed packet trace files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can either inject a malformed packet on the wire or send a malformed trace file to the victim."
