The provided content relates to CVE-2014-2364.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `webvact.ocx`, `dvs.ocx`, and `webdact.ocx` ActiveX files of Advantech WebAccess. This occurs when overly long strings are provided to specific parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in ActiveX controls (`webvact.ocx`, `dvs.ocx`, and `webdact.ocx`). Vulnerable parameters include `ProjectName`, `SetParameter`, `NodeName`, `CCDParameter`, `SetColor`, `AlarmImage`, `GetParameter`, `GetColor`, `ServerResponse`, `SetBaud`, and `IPAddress`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the target system by exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker with moderate skill is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can be remote.
