- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the Telegyr 8979 Master application when handling specially crafted invalid RTU messages. Additionally, a crafted message with a valid data length can cause subsequent messages to crash the service. The underlying issue was found to be in the GPT software library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation (CWE-20) leads to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the Telegyr 8979 Master application to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted RTU messages to the Telegyr 8979 master.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attack can be performed remotely, and requires moderate to high technical skills to craft a working exploit. The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted messages to the vulnerable service.
