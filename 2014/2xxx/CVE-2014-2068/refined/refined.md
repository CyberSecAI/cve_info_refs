Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2068:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stemmed from insufficient permission checks on certain system diagnostic functionalities within Jenkins. Specifically, the `/heapDump` functionality was accessible with lesser permissions than necessary.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue was that the `doHeapDump` function could be accessed with the `ADMINISTER` permission rather than the required `RUN_SCRIPTS` permission, allowing unauthorized access to system diagnostics functionalities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** In limited circumstances, an attacker could gain access to system diagnostic information (specifically the heap dump) that they should not have had access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker could directly send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server to access the `/heapDump` functionality.
- **Exploiting Insufficient Permission Checks:** An attacker needs to authenticate to Jenkins with at least "administer" permission to access the `/heapDump` endpoint, and could then potentially bypass the more restrictive "RUN\_SCRIPTS" permission check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Jenkins User:** The attacker needs to be a valid Jenkins user with at least `ADMINISTER` privileges. This is an important aspect of the vulnerability: an unauthenticated user is not able to exploit this issue.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Jenkins server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub commit (`0530a66`) shows the code change that addresses this issue by adding the `owner.checkPermission(Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS)` line, thus requiring the correct permission before accessing the heap dump functionality.

**Summary of Changes in the Commit:**
The commit `0530a6645aac10fec005614211660e98db44b5eb` fixes the vulnerability by adding an additional check for `Jenkins.RUN_SCRIPTS` permission to the `doHeapDump` method in `hudson.util.RemotingDiagnostics.java`.  The original check, `owner.checkPermission(Jenkins.ADMINISTER)` was insufficient because `ADMINISTER` implies `RUN_SCRIPTS`, while the heapdump functionality was not meant to be accessible to all admin users.

This vulnerability was rated "low" in the Jenkins security advisory, likely due to the limited circumstances and the need for some level of authentication.
