- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access arbitrary directories on the server's operating system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the `/dirmng/index.php` script with the `PUBLIC` parameter set to 1 and the `cdir` parameter containing a path traversal sequence (e.g., `/?PUBLIC=1&cdir=/`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. The attacker does not require authentication.
