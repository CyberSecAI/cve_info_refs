Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-2813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability that arises when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This can lead to memory corruption, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  Improper handling of objects in memory leads to corruption. This is a common vulnerability that can be triggered by various coding errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the current user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, allowing them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to exploit this vulnerability. They then need to convince users to visit these malicious websites.
- **Compromised/Malicious Websites:** Attackers can inject the malicious code into compromised websites, or into websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers rely on social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing emails or instant messages with malicious links) to trick users into visiting the malicious web page or opening a malicious attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a malicious website** or inject code into a compromised website.
- **Social engineering skills** to trick users into visiting a malicious link or opening an attachment.
- **No direct access to the user's system** is needed; the exploit is triggered through web browsing.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 9, 10 and 11, with severity rated as "Critical" on Windows clients and "Moderate" on Windows servers.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or exploited before the security bulletin was released.
- The update addresses the issue by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
