Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2014-2732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a **Relative Path Traversal** issue within the integrated web servers of Siemens SINEMA server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The web servers at Port 4999/TCP and Port 80/TCP do not properly handle file paths, allowing an attacker to navigate to directories outside the intended web server directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform **unauthenticated directory traversal** on the server.
*   The attacker can potentially access files on the server based on the application's file system permissions.
*   This could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SINEMA server.
*   **HTTP requests:** The attacker interacts with the integrated web servers on ports 4999/TCP and 80/TCP using HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to have network access to the server.
*   Low level of skill is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Siemens SINEMA server prior to V12 SP1.
*   The CVSS v2 base score for this vulnerability is 5.0, with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N).
*   No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability, at the time of the advisory publication.
*   The advisory refers to a related vulnerability, CVE-2014-2731, which is a code injection vulnerability, and another, CVE-2014-2733, which is an improper input validation vulnerability leading to a DoS.
