{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The DfDiskLo.sys driver in Faronics Deep Freeze does not properly validate parameters passed to the IofCallDriver function. Specifically, the ECX register, which should point to a DEVICE_OBJECT structure, is zero when an IOCTL request is sent.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper parameter validation in kernel-mode driver",
      "Use of an uninitialized or invalid pointer"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with Kernel privileges. Unsuccessful exploitation attempts can lead to system crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IOCTL request to the vulnerable driver.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have local access to the system. The vulnerability, by default, requires administrator privileges to trigger the IOCTL request. While the vulnerability itself does not allow privilege escalation, it could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities or techniques to achieve privilege escalation."
