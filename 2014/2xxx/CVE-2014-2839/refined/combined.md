## Advisory:

# CSRF and blind SQL injection in GD Star Rating 1.9.22

## Vulnerability

Last revised: February 18, 2014

This plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection. Carrying out an SQL injection requires access to an administrator account. However, the form contains no CSRF protection so an attacker may not need direct access to an account to perform denial of service or to compromise sensitive data.
