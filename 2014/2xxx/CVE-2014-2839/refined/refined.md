Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a blind SQL injection flaw in the GD Star Rating plugin for WordPress.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The plugin's search functionality within the admin panel is vulnerable to SQL injection. Input is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The form handling the search functionality lacks CSRF protection, which means that an attacker can potentially exploit the SQL injection via a crafted form without needing direct access to an admin account.
- **XSS:** While not the primary vulnerability, the advisory also mentions the presence of an XSS vulnerability that could also be used in conjunction with the lack of CSRF protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could use the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a DoS by executing time-consuming queries (e.g., using `sleep()`).
- **Compromise of Sensitive Data:** The attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is network-based. An attacker can submit a crafted form to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The vulnerable component is the search functionality within the `gd-star-rating-stats` admin page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't require direct access to an administrator account due to the lack of CSRF protection and the potential to leverage XSS, though having administrator level access directly would allow for a more direct exploit.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in version 1.9.22 of the GD Star Rating plugin.
- The proof of concept demonstrates the SQL injection using a `sleep()` command to cause a delay, but the injection can be used to perform other SQL operations, including data exfiltration.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.5 (High) with a vector of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:C) which means: Network, Low complexity, Single Authentication, Complete Confidentiality impact, No Integrity impact, Complete Availability impact.
-  The advisory indicates the issue was reported to the plugin developers but no response was received before the vulnerability was published.
