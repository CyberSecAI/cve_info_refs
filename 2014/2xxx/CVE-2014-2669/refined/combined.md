Package        : postgresql-8.4
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0060 CVE-2014-0061 CVE-2014-0062 CVE-2014-0063
                 CVE-2014-0064 CVE-2014-0065 CVE-2014-0066 CVE-2014-0067

Various vulnerabilities were discovered in PostgreSQL:

 * Shore up GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION restrictions (Noah Misch)

   Granting a role without ADMIN OPTION is supposed to prevent the grantee
   from adding or removing members from the granted role, but this
   restriction was easily bypassed by doing SET ROLE first. The security
   impact is mostly that a role member can revoke the access of others,
   contrary to the wishes of his grantor. Unapproved role member additions
   are a lesser concern, since an uncooperative role member could provide
   most of his rights to others anyway by creating views or SECURITY
   DEFINER functions. (CVE-2014-0060)

 * Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator functions
   (Andres Freund)

   The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
   during CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal SQL functions that a
   user can call explicitly. Calling a validator on a function actually
   written in some other language was not checked for and could be
   exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a
   call to a privilege-checking function in each validator function.
   Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this change to
   their own validator functions, if any. (CVE-2014-0061)

 * Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL (Robert Haas,
   Andres Freund)

   If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
   activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
   than other parts. At least in the case of CREATE INDEX, this can be used
   to cause the permissions checks to be performed against a different
   table than the index creation, allowing for a privilege escalation
   attack. (CVE-2014-0062)

 * Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)

   The MAXDATELEN constant was too small for the longest possible value of
   type interval, allowing a buffer overrun in interval_out(). Although the
   datetime input functions were more careful about avoiding buffer
   overrun, the limit was short enough to cause them to reject some valid
   inputs, such as input containing a very long timezone name. The ecpg
   library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.
   (CVE-2014-0063)

 * Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size calculations
   (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)

   Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
   size without checking for overflow. If overflow did occur, a too-small
   buffer would be allocated and then written past. (CVE-2014-0064)

 * Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich)

   Use strlcpy() and related functions to provide a clear guarantee that
   fixed-size buffers are not overrun. Unlike the preceding items, it is
   unclear whether these cases really represent live issues, since in most
   cases there appear to be previous constraints on the size of the input
   string. Nonetheless it seems prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of
   this type. (CVE-2014-0065)

 * Avoid crashing if crypt() returns NULL (Honza Horak, Bruce Momjian)

   There are relatively few scenarios in which crypt() could return NULL,
   but contrib/chkpass would crash if it did. One practical case in which
   this could be an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute
   unapproved hashing algorithms (e.g., "FIPS mode"). (CVE-2014-0066)

 * Document risks of make check in the regression testing instructions
   (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)

   Since the temporary server started by make check uses "trust"
   authentication, another user on the same machine could connect to it as
   database superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of the
   operating-system user who started the tests. A future release will
   probably incorporate changes in the testing procedure to prevent this
   risk, but some public discussion is needed first. So for the moment,
   just warn people against using make check when there are untrusted users
   on the same machine. (CVE-2014-0067)

For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.4.20-0squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.3.3-1 of the postgresql-9.3 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.

# PostgreSQL 9.3.3, 9.2.7, 9.1.12, 9.0.16 and 8.4.20 released!

Posted on **2014-02-20** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an important update to all supported versions of the PostgreSQL database system, which includes minor versions 9.3.3, 9.2.7, 9.1.12, 9.0.16, and 8.4.20. This update contains fixes for multiple security issues, as well as several fixes for replication and data integrity issues. All users are urged to update their installations at the earliest opportunity, especially those using binary replication or running a high-security application.

## Security Fixes

This update fixes [CVE-2014-0060](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0060), in which PostgreSQL did not properly enforce the WITH ADMIN OPTION permission for ROLE management. Before this fix, any member of a ROLE was able to grant others access to the same ROLE regardless if the member was given the WITH ADMIN OPTION permission. It also fixes multiple privilege escalation issues, including: [CVE-2014-0061](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0061), [CVE-2014-0062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0062), [CVE-2014-0063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0063), [CVE-2014-0064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0064), [CVE-2014-0065](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0065), and [CVE-2014-0066](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0066). More information on these issues can be found on [our security page](http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/) and [the security issue detail wiki page](http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/20140220securityrelease).

With this release, we are also alerting users to a known security
hole that allows other users on the same machine to gain access to an
operating system account while it is doing "make check": [CVE-2014-0067](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0067). "Make check" is normally part of building PostgreSQL from source code. As it is not possible to fix this issue without causing significant issues to our testing infrastructure, a patch will be released separately and publicly. Until then, users are strongly advised not to run "make check" on machines where untrusted users have accounts.

## Replication and Data Integrity Fixes

This update also fixes some issues which affect binary replication and row locking, and can cause recoverable data corruption in some cases. There are several fixes to index page locking issue during replication which can cause indexes on the replica to be corrupted. There is a fix to a transaction freezing bug in version 9.3 which could cause databases which cycled through transaction ID wraparound several times to have old row versions reappear. We have also fixed three bugs which could cause new standbys to fail to start up. Finally, this update fixes an issue which could break foreign keys, although the keys themselves will still need to be fixed manually after applying the update.

In version 9.3, these fixes result in the addition of several new server configuration settings to control multixact freezing. Importantly, standby servers must be updated to 9.3.3 or later before the replication master is updated, or replication will be broken.

## Other Improvements

In addition to the above, the following issues are fixed in this release:

* Fix WAL logging of visibility map change
* Make sure that GIN indexes log all insertions
* Get pause\_at\_recovery\_target to pause at correct time
* Ensure walreceiver sends hot-standby feedback messages on time
* Prevent timeout interrupts from taking control away from mainline code
* Eliminate several race conditions
* Fix some broken HINTs in error messages
* Prevent server lockup on SSL connection loss
* Fix two Unicode handling issues
* Prevent crash on certain subselect syntax
* Prevent crash on select from zero column table
* Fix two bugs with LATERAL
* Fix issue with UNION ALL, partitioning, and updates
* Ensure that ANALYZE understands domains over ranges
* Eliminate permissions check when using default tablespace
* Fix memory leakage in JSON functions
* Allow extensions with event triggers
* Distinguish numbers correctly in JSON output
* Fix permissions for pg\_start\_backup() and pg\_stop\_backup()
* Accept SHIFT\_JIS as locale name
* Fix .\* expansion for SQL function variables
* Prevent infinite loop on some COPY connection failures
* Several fixes for client issues on Windows
* Enable building PostgreSQL with Visual Studio 2013
* Update time zone files for recent changes

There are also fixes to all of the following optional modules (extensions): ECPG, dblink, ISN, pgbench, pg\_stat\_statements and postgres\_fdw. Additional changes and details of some of the above issues can be found in the Release Notes.

As with other minor releases, users are not required to dump and reload their database or use pg\_upgrade in order to apply this update release; you may simply shut down PostgreSQL and update its binaries. Users who have skipped multiple update releases may need to perform additional post-update steps; see the Release Notes for details.

Package        : postgresql-9.1
Vulnerability  : several
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-0060 CVE-2014-0061 CVE-2014-0062 CVE-2014-0063
                 CVE-2014-0064 CVE-2014-0065 CVE-2014-0066 CVE-2014-0067

Various vulnerabilities were discovered in PostgreSQL:

 * Shore up GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION restrictions (Noah Misch)

   Granting a role without ADMIN OPTION is supposed to prevent the grantee
   from adding or removing members from the granted role, but this
   restriction was easily bypassed by doing SET ROLE first. The security
   impact is mostly that a role member can revoke the access of others,
   contrary to the wishes of his grantor. Unapproved role member additions
   are a lesser concern, since an uncooperative role member could provide
   most of his rights to others anyway by creating views or SECURITY
   DEFINER functions. (CVE-2014-0060)

 * Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator functions
   (Andres Freund)

   The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called implicitly
   during CREATE FUNCTION, but they are also normal SQL functions that a
   user can call explicitly. Calling a validator on a function actually
   written in some other language was not checked for and could be
   exploited for privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a
   call to a privilege-checking function in each validator function.
   Non-core procedural languages will also need to make this change to
   their own validator functions, if any. (CVE-2014-0061)

 * Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL (Robert Haas,
   Andres Freund)

   If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to concurrent
   activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a different table
   than other parts. At least in the case of CREATE INDEX, this can be used
   to cause the permissions checks to be performed against a different
   table than the index creation, allowing for a privilege escalation
   attack. (CVE-2014-0062)

 * Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah Misch)

   The MAXDATELEN constant was too small for the longest possible value of
   type interval, allowing a buffer overrun in interval_out(). Although the
   datetime input functions were more careful about avoiding buffer
   overrun, the limit was short enough to cause them to reject some valid
   inputs, such as input containing a very long timezone name. The ecpg
   library contained these vulnerabilities along with some of its own.
   (CVE-2014-0063)

 * Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size calculations
   (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)

   Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
   size without checking for overflow. If overflow did occur, a too-small
   buffer would be allocated and then written past. (CVE-2014-0064)

 * Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich)

   Use strlcpy() and related functions to provide a clear guarantee that
   fixed-size buffers are not overrun. Unlike the preceding items, it is
   unclear whether these cases really represent live issues, since in most
   cases there appear to be previous constraints on the size of the input
   string. Nonetheless it seems prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of
   this type. (CVE-2014-0065)

 * Avoid crashing if crypt() returns NULL (Honza Horak, Bruce Momjian)

   There are relatively few scenarios in which crypt() could return NULL,
   but contrib/chkpass would crash if it did. One practical case in which
   this could be an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute
   unapproved hashing algorithms (e.g., "FIPS mode"). (CVE-2014-0066)

 * Document risks of make check in the regression testing instructions
   (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)

   Since the temporary server started by make check uses "trust"
   authentication, another user on the same machine could connect to it as
   database superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of the
   operating-system user who started the tests. A future release will
   probably incorporate changes in the testing procedure to prevent this
   risk, but some public discussion is needed first. So for the moment,
   just warn people against using make check when there are untrusted users
   on the same machine. (CVE-2014-0067)

For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1_9.1.12-0wheezy1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.3.3-1 of the postgresql-9.3 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.

```
Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
size such that the calculation wrapped to a small positive value when
arguments implied a sufficiently-large requirement.  Writes past the end
of the inadvertent small allocation followed shortly thereafter.
Coverity identified the path_in() vulnerability; code inspection led to
the rest.  In passing, add check_stack_depth() to prevent stack overflow
in related functions.

Back-patch to 8.4 (all supported versions).  The non-comment hstore
changes touch code that did not exist in 8.4, so that part stops at 9.0.

Noah Misch and Heikki Linnakangas, reviewed by Tom Lane.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1082154#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-28 20:23:16 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2014-2669](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2669) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2014-2669](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2669) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2669> Assigned: 20140328 Reference: <http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/20140220securityrelease> Reference: <http://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1506/> Reference: <http://www.postgresql.org/support/security/> Reference: <https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/31400a673325147e1205326008e32135a78b4d8a> Reference: DEBIAN:DSA-2864 Reference: <http://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-2864> Reference: DEBIAN:DSA-2865 Reference: <http://www.debian.org/security/2014/dsa-2865>  Multiple integer overflows in contrib/hstore/hstore_io.c in PostgreSQL 9.0.x before 9.0.16, 9.1.x before 9.1.12, 9.2.x before 9.2.7, and 9.3.x before 9.3.3 allow remote authenticated users to have unspecified impact via vectors related to the (1) hstore_recv, (2) hstore_from_arrays, and (3) hstore_from_array functions in contrib/hstore/hstore_io.c; and the (4) hstoreArrayToPairs function in contrib/hstore/hstore_op.c, which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from [CVE-2014-0064](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0064) because it has a different set of affected versions.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1082154#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-28 20:31:17 UTC  ``` See [bug #1065230](show_bug.cgi?id=1065230 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-0064 postgresql: integer overflows leading to buffer overflows") for details on [CVE-2014-0064](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0064).  Because both Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 do not ship with PostgreSQL 9.x, they are not affected by this flaw.   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of PostgreSQL as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Heikki Linnakangas and Noah Misch as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1082154#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-28 20:50:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Software Collections for RHEL-6  Via RHSA-2014:0221 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0221.html>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1082154#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2014-05-12 18:18:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    CloudForms Management Engine 5.x  Via RHSA-2014:0469 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2014-0469.html>   ``` |  |

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0221)

## Topic

Updated postgresql92-postgresql packages that fix multiple security issues
are now available for Red Hat Software Collections 1.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

PostgreSQL is an advanced object-relational database management system
(DBMS).

Multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the date/time
implementation of PostgreSQL. An authenticated database user could provide
a specially crafted date/time value that, when processed, could cause
PostgreSQL to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0063)

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in various type input functions in PostgreSQL. An authenticated
database user could possibly use these flaws to crash PostgreSQL or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0064)

Multiple potential buffer overflow flaws were found in PostgreSQL.
An authenticated database user could possibly use these flaws to crash
PostgreSQL or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0065)

It was found that granting an SQL role to a database user in a PostgreSQL
database without specifying the "ADMIN" option allowed the grantee to
remove other users from their granted role. An authenticated database user
could use this flaw to remove a user from an SQL role which they were
granted access to. (CVE-2014-0060)

A flaw was found in the validator functions provided by PostgreSQL's
procedural languages (PLs). An authenticated database user could possibly
use this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-0061)

A race condition was found in the way the CREATE INDEX command performed
multiple independent lookups of a table that had to be indexed. An
authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate their
privileges. (CVE-2014-0062)

It was found that the chkpass extension of PostgreSQL did not check the
return value of the crypt() function. An authenticated database user could
possibly use this flaw to crash PostgreSQL via a null pointer dereference.
(CVE-2014-0066)

Red Hat would like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Noah Misch as the original reporter of
CVE-2014-0060 and CVE-2014-0063, Heikki Linnakangas and Noah Misch as the
original reporters of CVE-2014-0064, Peter Eisentraut and Jozef Mlich as
the original reporters of CVE-2014-0065, Andres Freund as the original
reporter of CVE-2014-0061, Robert Haas and Andres Freund as the original
reporters of CVE-2014-0062, and Honza Horak and Bruce Momjian as the
original reporters of CVE-2014-0066.

These updated packages upgrade PostgreSQL to version 9.2.7, which fixes
these issues as well as several non-security issues. Refer to the
PostgreSQL Release Notes for a full list of changes:

<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/release-9-2-7.html>

All PostgreSQL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,
which contain backported patches to correct these issues. If the postgresql
service is running, it will be automatically restarted after installing
this update.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/site/articles/11258>

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users‚Äô data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program‚Äôs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat‚Äôs CVE database.

When a technology‚Äîenabled and most likely used by default‚Äîcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking¬† and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.¬† CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.¬† In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.¬† In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.¬† For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.¬† The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# 2014-02-20 Consolidated Security Update

The 2014-02-20 update contains fixes for multiple security issues. Most of these are "Class C" security issues, meaning that they require prior valid login for privilege escalation. Some also require additional database conditions to be true in order to be exploited. One fix below breaks backwards compatibility in a way that complies with our documentation but not with past behavior.

Summaries below provided by Noah Misch and Tom Lane.

## Vulnerability during "make check"

[CVE-2014-0067](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0067) PostgreSQL: Vulnerability during "make check"

**This issue is not fixed in this release. It was fixed in later releases. Please update to the very latest minor version in order to have this issue fully patched.**

We are posting it in the interests of transparency, and so that database administrators and security staff will take the appropriate measures to secure their servers.

### Explanation

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group security team has discovered a
vulnerability in the scripts that orchestrate PostgreSQL
test suites that validate the functionality of the PostgreSQL binaries.
While a test suite is running, a user with interactive access to the system
can hijack the operating system user account running
the suite. Only users who run "make check" on a system they share with
untrusted users are at risk. A future set of update releases will fix
this vulnerability, though there will be no need to reinstall existing
deployments. In the meantime, users are advised to run the test suites
only on non-shared systems or under operating system user accounts
dedicated to the task of running test suites.

This vulnerability arises from the test scripts' use of "initdb" to create
a PostgreSQL database cluster permitting local "trust" authentication.
User-crafted workflows doing the same will exhibit the same vulnerability.
We recommend studying automated usage of initdb in your own software. If
a procedure in question could run on a system shared with untrusted users,
follow the same precautions around that procedure as for the PostgreSQL
test suites. The fix for PostgreSQL itself will establish a secure
pattern for automating initdb, which you can later adopt.

On Unix-like platforms the attacker needs to be able to reach the server's
socket file, so the risk depends on where the platform places the socket
file and whether there are filesystem permissions protections in place.
On Windows, the server opens a locally-accessible TCP socket, so there is
no possibility of ameliorating the risk through filesystem permissions.

The changes required to make this situation safer are expected to be
somewhat invasive and might break user-crafted testing workflows.
Therefore, the PostgreSQL project will not actually be supplying a fix on
20-Feb, merely announcing that there is a problem and recommending that
users not use "make check" on machines shared with untrusted users. Suitable changes to the regression testing setup will subsequently
be debated publicly and can be expected to be incorporated in future
releases.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

## SET ROLE bypasses lack of ADMIN OPTION

[CVE-2014-0060](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0060) PostgreSQL: SET ROLE bypasses lack of ADMIN OPTION

**This change will break backwards compatibility for users who were expecting the prior, broken behavior. The new behavior is in compliance with the documentation.**

### Explanation

Enforce ADMIN OPTION restrictions.

Granting a role without ADMIN OPTION is supposed to prevent the grantee
from adding or removing members from the granted role. Issuing SET ROLE
before the GRANT bypassed that, because the role itself had an implicit
right to add or remove members. This issue was fixed by recognizing that
implicit right only when the session user matches the current role.
Additionally, do not recognize it during a security-restricted operation
or during execution of a SECURITY DEFINER function. The restriction on
SECURITY DEFINER is not security-critical. However, it seems best for a
user testing his or her own SECURITY DEFINER function to see the same behavior
others will see. Affects all supported versions back to 8.4.

The SQL standards do not conflate roles and users as PostgreSQL does;
only SQL roles have members, and only SQL users initiate sessions. An
application using PostgreSQL users and roles as SQL users and roles will
never attempt to grant membership in the role that is the session user,
so the implicit right to add or remove members will never arise.

The security impact was mostly that a role member could revoke access
from others, contrary to the wishes of the role member's grantor. Unapproved
role member additions are less notable, because the member can still largely
achieve that by creating a view or a SECURITY DEFINER function.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch and Jonas Sundman for reporting
this problem.

## Language validators are accessible for everyone

[CVE-2014-0061](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0061) PostgreSQL: Privilege escalation via explicit calls to validator functions

### Explanation

PostgreSQL procedural languages (PLs) normally provide a "validator"
function that performs creation-time checking of syntax etc. for
functions written in that language. These validator functions can
be called directly from SQL, too, which is intended to allow post-facto
checking of existing function definitions. However, unexpected and
possibly insecure results could be obtained by feeding the text of a
function defined in one language to the validator for another language.
Moreover, in many languages the validator might perform some limited amount
of code execution, opening the possibility of an attacker executing
code without permission. The security impact is thus that an authenticated
database user might be able to escalate his or her privileges.

The fix will cause validator functions to throw an error when used
against a function defined in another language, or against a function
the current user doesn't have permissions to call.

While the PostgreSQL project will fix the validator functions in PLs
distributed with PostgreSQL, the same two-line fix will be needed in
validator functions of PLs developed externally. There are many
such extensions and we cannot be certain that all of their developers
will respond promptly.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Andres Freund for reporting this problem.

## Race condition in CREATE INDEX allows for privilege escalation

[CVE-2014-0062](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0062) PostgreSQL: Race condition in CREATE INDEX allows for privilege escalation

### Description

CREATE INDEX, and some ALTER TABLE statements, did multiple
independent lookups of the table the index is
supposed to be created on. Concurrent creation or deletion of another
table of the same name (but in a different schema) might cause some of
these lookups to find one table and some the other table. This allows
effects such as creating an index on a table one doesn't own, thus
exposing data to the calling user that should not be able to access.
This vulnerability exists in all affected versions, but is more easily exploited in 9.2 and 9.3.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Andres Freund for reporting this problem.

## Potential Buffer Overruns in Datetime Input/Output

* [CVE-2014-0063](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0063) PostgreSQL: Potential buffer overruns in datetime input/output

### Descriptions

Many functions use the MAXDATELEN constant to size a buffer for parsing
or displaying a datetime value. However, the buffer was much too small
for the longest possible interval output and slightly too small for certain valid
timestamp inputs, particularly input with a long timezone name.
Inputs that were too long would be rejected needlessly, while outputs
that were too long would result in stack corruption, which could crash
the server and could be exploitable for arbitrary code execution.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Daniel Sch√ºssler for reporting this problem.

## Buffer overflow in path\_in()

* [CVE-2014-0064](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0064) PostgreSQL: Potential buffer overruns due to integer overflow in size calculations

### Description

Predict integer overflow to avoid buffer overruns.

Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an allocation
size such that the calculation wrapped to a small positive value when
arguments implied a sufficiently-large requirement. Writes past the end
of the inadvertent small allocation followed shortly thereafter.
Coverity Scan identified the path\_in() vulnerability; code inspection led to
the rest. In passing, add check\_stack\_depth() to prevent stack overflow
in related functions.

Affects all supported versions back to 8.4. The non-comment hstore
changes touch code that did not exist in 8.4, so that part stops at 9.0.

## Potential Buffer Overruns of Fixed-Size Buffers

* [CVE-2014-0065](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0065) PostgreSQL: Potential buffer overruns of fixed-size buffers

### Explanation

Coverity Scan identified a number of places in which it could not prove that a
string being copied into a fixed-size buffer would fit. We believe that
most, perhaps all of these, are in fact safe or are copying data that is
coming from a trusted source so that any overrun is not really a
security issue. Nonetheless it seems prudent to forestall any risk by
using strlcpy() and similar functions.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Peter Eisentraut and Jozef Mlich for reporting
this problem.

## Potential null pointer dereference crash when crypt(3) returns NULL

[CVE-2014-0066](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0066) PostgreSQL: Potential null pointer dereference crash when crypt(3) returns NULL

### Explanation

The chkpass extension uses the standard crypt() library function, which
is defined to return NULL on failure, but it was not checking for NULL
before using the result. The main practical case in which this could be
an issue is if libc is configured to refuse to execute unapproved
hashing algorithms ("FIPS mode").

The PostgreSQL project thanks Honza Horak for reporting this problem.

# Security Information

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group (PGDG) takes security seriously. This
allows our users to place their trust in PostgreSQL for protecting their
mission-critical data.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group follows a model that shares
responsibility between PostgreSQL itself and its deployment environment,
including hardware, operating system, and the application layer
(programming language, frameworks and client libraries). The PostgreSQL
documentation provides info on the inherent security features of PostgreSQL
and how to securely configure and run PostgreSQL.

Security vulnerabilities can exist both in PostgreSQL and software within the
PostgreSQL ecosystem, including client libraries, extensions, installers,
and other utilities. This page walks through what is considered a security
vulnerability in PostgreSQL, how to report PostgreSQL security
vulnerabilities, and how fixes for security vulnerabilities are released.

Please note that the PostgreSQL Project does not offer bug bounties.

## CVE Numbering Authority

The PostgreSQL Project is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA), working with Red Hat
as our CNA Root. This allows us to assign our own CVE numbers and publish CVE
records for PostgreSQL and closely related projects.

We will currently assign CVE numbers for the following projects upon request to
cna@postgresql.org:

* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL RPM packaging](https://yum.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL DEB packaging](https://apt.postgresql.org/)
* [PostgreSQL Windows/macOS installers (EDB)](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-installers)
* [pgJDBC](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/)
* [psqlODBC](https://odbc.postgresql.org/)
* [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

Additional projects may request inclusion on the list above by emailing
cna@postgresql.org.

**NOTE:** The security team will only assign CVEs to projects
when requested by members of the project. If you think you've found a security
issue in a project other than PostgreSQL or it's packages and installers,
please contact the security team for that project. See below for more details.

## What is a Security Vulnerability in PostgreSQL?

A security vulnerability in PostgreSQL is an issue that allows a user to gain
access to privileges or data that they do not have permission to use, or
allows a user to execute arbitrary code through a PostgreSQL process.

The PostgreSQL Security Team does not consider reports on actions a PostgreSQL
superuser takes to be a security vulnerability. However, a report on an
unprivileged user escalating to superuser generally qualifies as valid.

The PostgreSQL Security Team typically does not consider a denial-of-service
on a PostgreSQL server from an authenticated, valid SQL statement to be a
security vulnerability. A denial-of-service issue of this nature could still
be a [bug](/account/submitbug/), and we encourage you to report it
on the [Report a Bug](/account/submitbug/) page.

Please do not report the lack of DMARC on postgresql.org mailing lists. This
is by design.

## Reporting a PostgreSQL Security Vulnerability

For security vulnerabilities in PostgreSQL or any of the installers linked
from the [PostgreSQL download page](/download/), please email
security@postgresql.org.

For reporting non-security bugs, please visit the
[Report a Bug](/account/submitbug/) page.

If you are unsure if an issue is a security vulnerability, please err on the
side of caution and email
security@postgresql.org.

## Reporting non-PostgreSQL Security Vulnerabilities

Please see below for how you can report security vulnerabilities in
PostgreSQL-related projects:

* For security vulnerabilities in the [PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org),
  please email
  pgsql-jdbc-security@lists.postgresql.org.
* For security vulnerabilities in [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/),
  please email security@pgadmin.org.
* If you wish to report a security vulnerability for any other open source project in
  the PostgreSQL ecosystem (e.g. a driver, an extension, or an installer) and
  need a secure communication channel, please email
  security@postgresql.org.

## PostgreSQL Security Releases

The PostgreSQL Project releases security fixes as part of
[minor version updates](/support/versioning/). You are always
advised to use the latest minor version available, as it will contain other
non-security related fixes.

A new PostgreSQL major release, which contains new features, has every prior
security fix.

If you find a security vulnerability in PostgreSQL, the PostgreSQL Security
Team will credit you in the release notes and register a CVE for the
vulnerability. **Please do not register a CVE independently of the
PostgreSQL Security Team**.

## PostgreSQL Security Notifications

To receive notifications about security releases or other security
related news, you can subscribe to
the [pgsql-announce](/list/) mailing list. If you set your
subscription to only include the tag *Security*, it will
exclude all other announcements that are sent to this list.

## Known PostgreSQL Security Vulnerabilities

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group believes that accuracy, completeness
and availability of security information is essential for our users. We choose
to pool all information on this one page, allowing easy searching for security
vulnerabilities over a range of criteria. This includes:

* Which major versions a security vulnerability is present in
* Which minor version update releases a security vulnerability is fixed in
* Whether an exploit requires a valid login
* CVSS score

You can find more detailed information about a security vulnerability by
clicking on the links in the table below.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2014%3A0469)

## Topic

Updated cfme packages that fix multiple security issues, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat CloudForms 3.0.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
Important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and
automation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual
environments.

A flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails' actionpack rubygem performed
JSON parameter parsing. An application using a third party library, which
uses the Rack::Request interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass
the protection implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing
the application to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to
CVE-2013-0155. (CVE-2013-6417)

An input sanitization flaw was found in the saved\_report\_delete action in
the ReportController. An authenticated Management Engine user could use
this flaw to perform an SQL injection attack on the Management Engine back
end database. (CVE-2014-0137)

It was found that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine did not properly
check user role permissions for actions associated with catalogs.
An authenticated Management Engine user could use this flaw to delete
arbitrary catalogs regardless of the granted permissions. (CVE-2014-0078)

Multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the date/time
implementation of PostgreSQL. An authenticated database user could provide
a specially crafted date/time value that, when processed, could cause
PostgreSQL to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0063)

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in various type input functions in PostgreSQL. An authenticated
database user could possibly use these flaws to crash PostgreSQL or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user
running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0064, CVE-2014-2669)

Multiple potential buffer overflow flaws were found in PostgreSQL.
An authenticated database user could possibly use these flaws to crash
PostgreSQL or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0065)

It was found that granting an SQL role to a database user in a PostgreSQL
database without specifying the "ADMIN" option allowed the grantee to
remove other users from their granted role. An authenticated database user
could use this flaw to remove a user from an SQL role which they were
granted access to. (CVE-2014-0060)

A flaw was found in the validator functions provided by PostgreSQL's
procedural languages. An authenticated database user could possibly use
this flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-0061)

A race condition was found in the way PostgreSQL's CREATE INDEX command
performed multiple independent lookups of a table that had to be indexed.
An authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2014-0062)

It was found that the chkpass extension of PostgreSQL did not check the
return value of the crypt() function. An authenticated database user could
possibly use this flaw to crash PostgreSQL via a null pointer dereference.
(CVE-2014-0066)

Red Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting
CVE-2013-6417; upstream acknowledges Sudhir Rao as the original reporter
of this issue.

Red Hat would also like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting
CVE-2014-0060, CVE-2014-0061, CVE-2014-0062, CVE-2014-0063, CVE-2014-0064,
CVE-2014-0065, CVE-2014-0066, and CVE-2014-2669; upstream acknowledges Noah
Misch, Heikki Linnakangas, Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich, Andres Freund,
Robert Haas, Honza Horak, and Bruce Momjian as the original reporters of
these issues.

The CVE-2014-0137 and CVE-2014-0078 issues were discovered by Jan Rusnacko
of the Red Hat Product Security Team.

## Solution

These updated packages upgrade PostgreSQL to version 9.2.7, which fixes
these issues as well as several non-security issues. Refer to the
PostgreSQL Release Notes for a full list of changes:

<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/release-9-2-7.html>

This update also fixes several bugs and adds various enhancements.
Documentation for these changes will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document linked to in the References section.

All users of Red Hat CloudForms 3.0 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.

Before applying this update, make sure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
