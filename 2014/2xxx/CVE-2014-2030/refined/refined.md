{
  "CVE-2014-2030": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow flaw exists in ImageMagick when handling PSD images. Specifically, when writing layer names, the code uses the format string \"L%06ld\", which can write more bytes than the allocated buffer size, especially in newer ImageMagick versions. This is because the code did not recognize the relationship between the 8 (or more) characters in \"L%06ld\" and the actual buffer size.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect usage of format string `L%06ld` with a fixed-size buffer.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow",
        "Improper Input Validation"
       ],
      "impact": "A specially crafted PSD image can trigger a buffer overflow, potentially leading to a denial of service or code execution."
    },
    "attack_vector": {
      "vector": "By tricking a user or automated system using ImageMagick into opening a specially crafted PSD image.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a PSD image with a specific number of layers to trigger the overflow."
     }
