Vulnerability title: Arbitrary file read in dompdf
CVE: CVE-2014-2383
Vendor: dompdf
Product: dompdf
Affected version: v0.6.0
Fixed version: v0.6.1 (partial fix)
Reported by: Alejo Murillo Moyas

Details:
An arbitrary file read vulnerability is present on dompdf.php file that
allows remote or local attackers to read local files using a special
crafted argument. This vulnerability requires the configuration flag
DOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP to be enabled (which is disabled by default).

Using PHP protocol and wrappers it is possible to bypass the dompdf's
"chroot" protection (DOMPDF_CHROOT) which prevents dompdf from accessing
system files or other files on the webserver. Please note that the flag
DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE needs to be enabled.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

The removal of the pre-processing of PHP code is causing me issues:

Is there a workaround for my issue?

What the pre-processing did was `eval()` the document/string prior to import into dompdf. We want to move away from that kind of functionality, which is secondary to the main purpose of dompdf, in order to limit the potential attack surface.

How are you using dompdf? Based on the call stack it looks like you are using the class. If you need to pre-process your code you can just add a step to `eval()` your code prior to passing it to dompdf. If that's not possible, you can add the removed code back in to dompdf.cls.php, it shouldn't affect anything otherwise.

Thanks [@bsweeney](https://github.com/bsweeney) for your quick reply

I'd like to getaway from having that code if you've removed it from the master branch of dompdf

I'm a bit unsure how to `eval()` my code prior to passing it to dompdf. I use this at the bottom of my PHP file which I convert to a PDF using dompdf:

```
<script type="text/php">
    if (isset($pdf)) {
        $w = $pdf->get_width();
        $h = $pdf->get_height();

        $text = Font_Metrics::get_font('Lucida Sans');
        $footer = $pdf->open_object();
        $pdf->add_object($footer, 'all');
        $pdf->page_text(30, $h-30, strtoupper('<?php echo implode(" ", array($forename1{0} . "." . (strlen($surname) > 13 ? substr($surname, 0, 6) . "..." . substr($surname, -5, 5) : $surname), "(" . $personal_id . "-" . $application_id . ")")); ?>'), $font, 10, array(0, 0, 0));
    }
</script>
```

And I use this to run/call dompdf:

```
spl_autoload_register('DOMPDF_autoload');
$dompdf = new DOMPDF();
$dompdf->set_paper('a4', 'portrait');
$dompdf->load_html(file_get_contents($html));
$dompdf->render();

if($stream){
    $dompdf->stream($filename . '.pdf');
} else {
    $output = $dompdf->output();
    file_put_contents($dirname . $filename . '.pdf', $output);
}
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

The inline script will still run, but as you've seen your code that generates the inline script will have to be modified. Since you're not doing anything with page numbering in that code you could just as easily re-write it using a fixed-position element. replace your inline script with something like the following:

```
<div style="font-family: Lucia Sans, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; position: fixed; bottom: 30px; left: 30px; right: 30px;">
  <?php echo strtoupper(implode(" ", array($forename1{0} . "." . (strlen($surname) > 13 ? substr($surname, 0, 6) . "..." . substr($surname, -5, 5) : $surname), "(" . $personal_id . "-" . $application_id . ")"))); ?>
</div>
```

If that doesn't work for you the easiest fix would be to run the string generation as part of the inline script. That would only work if the variables are available globally.

```
<script type="text/php">
    if (isset($pdf)) {
        $w = $pdf->get_width();
        $h = $pdf->get_height();

        $text = Font_Metrics::get_font('Lucida Sans');
        $footer = $pdf->open_object();
        $pdf->add_object($footer, 'all');
        $pdf->page_text(30, $h-30, strtoupper(implode(" ", array($GLOBALS['forename1']{0} . "." . (strlen($GLOBALS['surname']) > 13 ? substr(GLOBALS['$surname'], 0, 6) . "..." . substr($GLOBALS['surname'], -5, 5) : $GLOBALS['surname']), "(" . $GLOBALS['personal_id'] . "-" . $GLOBALS['application_id'] . ")"))), $font, 10, array(0, 0, 0));
    }
</script>
```

(You'll have to check that code ... I didn't).

Thanks again [@bsweeney](https://github.com/bsweeney)

I ended up just changing my call to be this:

```
spl_autoload_register('DOMPDF_autoload');
$dompdf = new DOMPDF();
$dompdf->set_paper('a4', 'portrait');

//start new code
ob_start();
include $html;
$html = ob_get_clean();
//end new code

$dompdf->load_html($html);
$dompdf->render();

if($stream){
    $dompdf->stream($filename . '.pdf');
} else {
    $output = $dompdf->output();
    file_put_contents($dirname . $filename . '.pdf', $output);
}
```

Sorry, something went wrong.
