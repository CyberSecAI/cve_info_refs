Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2383:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `dompdf.php` file in the dompdf library which, when processing user-supplied input, allows the use of the PHP stream wrapper (`php://`). This, combined with the `filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource` chain, enables arbitrary file reading.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system by manipulating the input file parameter.
*   **Bypassing Chroot:**  The vulnerability bypasses dompdf's intended "chroot" protection (`DOMPDF_CHROOT`), which was meant to restrict access to system files.
*   **PHP Stream Wrapper Abuse:** The use of the `php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource` allows the attacker to access local files using the PHP stream wrapper, and read and base64 encode its content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of potentially sensitive information from the server's file system, such as application source code, configuration files, or data files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote or Local Attackers:**  The vulnerability can be exploited both remotely (through the web interface if `DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE` is enabled) and locally (through command line if `DOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP` is enabled).
*   **Crafted Input Argument:** The attack involves crafting a specific input to the `dompdf.php` file using the `php://filter` wrapper.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to `dompdf.php`:** The attacker needs to be able to access the `dompdf.php` file, either through the web interface, if `DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE` is enabled or via the command line (if `DOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP` is enabled).
*   **Understanding of PHP Stream Wrappers:** The attacker needs to be aware of PHP stream wrappers and how to use them to access files.
*   **Specific Configuration:** The attacker will need the `DOMPDF_ENABLE_PHP` and `DOMPDF_ENABLE_REMOTE` configuration flags to be enabled in order to use the php stream wrapper.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content includes a commit that addresses the vulnerability by disallowing I/O streams as file input, and removal of php preprocessing.
*   The vulnerability is present in version `v0.6.0` of dompdf, and version `v0.6.1` only provided a partial fix.
* The fix removed the ability to process PHP code within the HTML passed to dompdf.
