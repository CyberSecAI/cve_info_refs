Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2065:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Jenkins handles the `iconSize` cookie. Specifically, the value of this cookie was not properly validated before being used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of input validation on the `iconSize` cookie allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the cookie's value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   If an attacker can override the victim's `iconSize` cookie, they can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the Jenkins application. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves manipulating the `iconSize` cookie. This could be achieved in environments where an attacker can influence the victim's browser, such as through:
    *   Network-level attacks (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks).
    *   Compromised infrastructure within the network.
    *   Potentially, other XSS vulnerabilities or injection flaws that could be leveraged to set the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to override the Jenkins cookies in the victim's browser. This implies a certain level of control over the network or the ability to manipulate the victim's web traffic.
*   No direct access to the Jenkins server is required.
* The advisory also mentions that this is an "unusual threat model".

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves introducing input validation on the value of the `iconSize` cookie, ensuring it matches the pattern `\d+x\d+` which is the expected format of an icon size string. This prevents the injection of malicious javascript code through the cookie.
*   The advisory rates this as a "low" severity vulnerability due to the requirement for a specific threat model where the attacker can control cookies. This implies that the vulnerability is less likely to be exploited than other, higher-rated vulnerabilities.
