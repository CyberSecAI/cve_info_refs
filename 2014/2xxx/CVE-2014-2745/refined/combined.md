We’re pleased to present Prosody 0.9.4, the latest release from our stable 0.9 branch.

This release fixes a security (denial of service) issue. If you are using mod\_compression then
we strongly recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible or disable compression (it
is disabled by default) to prevent potential resource consumption by untrusted users.

A summary of changes in this release:

* Compression: Disallow compression on unauthenticated streams
* Core: Limit default read size and maximum stanza size
* Core: Enable SASL EXTERNAL by default for component s2s
* S2S: Warn if `s2s_secure_auth` and `s2s_require_encryption` have been set in conflicting ways
* S2S: Warn if no local network addresses were found, preventing successful s2s
* MUC: Fix traceback when a non-occupant tried to change an occupant’s role
* MUC: API: Fire an event when temporary rooms are destroyed after the last person leaves
* Telnet: Fixed traceback when listing users
* Telnet: Apply normalization to JIDs in user management commands
* HTTP: Fix directory detection in file server on Windows
* Plugins: Fix paths on Windows
* MOTD: Don’t strip blank lines from the message provided in the config
* prosodyctl: Better error reporting when generating certificates
* Makefile: Improve FreeBSD compatibility
* Multiple fixes to our migration tools, and support for importing MUCs from ejabberd

Subject: Re: Possible CVE Request: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption with XMPP-Layer Compression

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> Is this something which should get one CVE, or is a CVE for each
> implementation needed?

A single CVE for this cross-vendor situation seems wrong because the
specification apparently does not require implementations to have an
unrestricted decompression capability.

There could conceivably be two CVEs for a single implementation,
although we haven't yet found a reference that is reporting an
implementation's problems at that level of detail. Most likely there
would be one CVE per implementation.

> <http://xmpp.org/resources/security-notices/uncontrolled-resource-consumption-with-highly-compressed-xmpp-stanzas/>

The two types of CVEs would be:

(1)
> XEP-0170 on "Recommended Order of Stream Feature Negotiation" suggests
> to negotiate stream compression after the authentication of the
> principals. This suggests that xmppbombs can be used only after the
> user authentication. When decompressing XMPP stanzas, an XMPP server
> must limit the resources allocated to this task. If the server fails
> to do that, it can monopolize the CPU usage and allocate all the
> available memory.

Here, the root cause is that the behavior in the authenticated case
does not properly address resource consumption. Apparently multiple
vendors are characterizing this as a vulnerability.

(2)
> it has been reported that some implementations allow the use of
> compression before the authentication phase therefore opening up this
> vulnerability to unknown attackers.

Here, the root cause is a violation of a specification, resulting in a
security impact.

A hypothetical example is that a server is willing to decompress
relatively short strings in unauthenticated sessions (e.g., decompress
32 kilobytes to 32 megabytes). That same server has no restrictions on
authenticated sessions, and can produce gigabytes of uncompressed
data. In this scenario, two CVE IDs would be assigned because the two
resource-consumption issues occur for different reasons.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Re: (Openfire M-Link Metronome Prosody Tigase) Possible CVE Request: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption with XMPP-Layer Compression

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> <http://xmpp.org/resources/security-notices/uncontrolled-resource-consumption-with-highly-compressed-xmpp-stanzas/>

igniterealtime.org   Openfire   Fixed in 3.9.2

We did not find any commits for this under the
<http://fisheye.igniterealtime.org/changelog/> URL. Accordingly, only
one CVE is possible at present. Use CVE-2014-2741.

Isode Ltd.           M-Link     Fixed in 16.0v7

We did not find any details about the change under the
<http://www.isode.com/products/m-link.html> URL. (Also, the
<http://www.isode.com/evaluate/instant-messaging-xmpp.html> page seems
to imply that this is not open source.) Accordingly, only one CVE is
possible at present. Use CVE-2014-2742.

lightwitch.org       Metronome  Fix in progress
<http://code.lightwitch.org/metronome/rev/49f47277a411>

Use CVE-2014-2743 for "Don't process deflated data if it exceedes the
max allowed limit."

Use CVE-2014-2744 for "Don't allow to compress a stream if it's not
authenticated."

Prosody              Prosody    Fixed in 0.9.4
<http://blog.prosody.im/prosody-0-9-4-released/>

Use CVE-2014-2745 for these changes that address resource consumption
in general:
  <http://hg.prosody.im/0.9/rev/a97591d2e1ad>
  <http://hg.prosody.im/0.9/rev/1107d66d2ab2>

Use CVE-2014-2744 for this change that addresses decompression of
unauthenticated data:
  <http://hg.prosody.im/0.9/rev/b3b1c9da38fb>

(This is exactly the same plugins/mod_compression.lua fix as in
Metronome, and thus has the same CVE ID. Metronome was originally
based on the Prosody codebase.)

Tigase               Tigase     Fixed in 5.2.1
<http://www.tigase.org/content/uncontrolled-resource-consumption-highly-compressed-xmpp-messages>
<https://projects.tigase.org/projects/tigase-server/repository/revisions/7f5af2f8c5b97bbf9def66fbb9dd47746a7ac292>
<https://projects.tigase.org/issues/1780> (not a public bug)

We did not determine that more than one issue was fixed. Accordingly,
only one CVE is possible at present. Use CVE-2014-2746.

Erlang Solutions     MongooseIM Under Investigation

We did not find anything under the
<https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/commits/master> URL. There is
apparently no publicly known vulnerability and thus no CVE assignment.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2895-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : prosody

A denial-of-service vulnerability has been reported in Prosody, a XMPP
server. If compression is enabled, an attacker might send highly-com-
pressed XML elements (attack known as "zip bomb") over XMPP streams and
consume all the resources of the server.

The SAX XML parser lua-expat is also affected by this issues.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.2-4+deb7u1 of prosody.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1 of prosody.

For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-5+deb7u1 of lua-expat.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0-1 lua-expat.

We recommend that you upgrade your prosody and lua-expat packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
