Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-2579:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient validation of HTTP request origin in XCloner Standalone. This lack of validation allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is CSRF (CWE-352). The application doesn't properly verify the origin of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Control of the Website:**  An attacker can gain complete control over the website by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability.
    *   **Password Change:** An attacker can change the administrator's password, leading to account takeover.
    *   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user, allowing for a compromise of the host system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting a specially crafted webpage. This webpage then sends forged requests to the vulnerable XCloner application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote from the target system.
*   **Target User Logged In:** The attacker needs to target a logged-in administrator to successfully exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Ability to host malicious webpage:** The attacker requires the ability to host a malicious webpage which the target will visit.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit examples show how an attacker can change an admin password by submitting a crafted form and execute arbitrary code by including a system command in the `dbbackup_comp` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in XCloner Standalone versions 3.5 and probably prior.
*   The exploit to run arbitrary system commands requires that the options 'enable\_db\_backup' and 'sql\_mem' are enabled in the application's configuration file.
*   The vendor did not respond to notifications of the vulnerability, and there is no official solution.
*   A temporary solution is to remove the vulnerable script or restrict access via WAF or .htaccess.
*   The CVSSv2 score is 7.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), indicating a high-risk vulnerability due to the high impact and the possibility of a remote attack.
