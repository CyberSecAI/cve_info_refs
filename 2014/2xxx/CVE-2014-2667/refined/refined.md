    "root_cause": "A race condition exists in the `_get_masked_mode` function of `Lib/os.py` in Python. When `exist_ok` is true and multiple threads are used, the function temporarily sets the umask to 0 and then restores it. A separate application vulnerability could be exploited during the brief window where the umask is 0, potentially leading to unintended file permission.",
