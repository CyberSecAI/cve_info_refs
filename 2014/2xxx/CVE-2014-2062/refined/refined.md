Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2062:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2014-2062 is related to a vulnerability in Jenkins where deleting a user does not invalidate their API token. This allows the deleted user to continue accessing Jenkins through the API, even though they should no longer be authorized.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper invalidation of API tokens upon user deletion. When a user account was deleted, the associated API token was not revoked or invalidated, allowing the token to still be used to authenticate to the Jenkins API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the failure to invalidate API tokens upon user deletion. This constitutes a Broken Access Control vulnerability, as it allows unauthorized access to the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability allows a deleted user to retain access to Jenkins functionalities that should be restricted. This could include:
- Viewing sensitive data
- Modifying configurations
- Triggering builds
- Potentially performing other actions depending on the userâ€™s previous permissions

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the Jenkins API. An attacker who was a legitimate user but has been deleted, can still use their previously valid API token to interact with the Jenkins API.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have previously had a valid Jenkins user account and have generated an API token.
- The attacker's account must have been deleted.
- The attacker needs to retain the API token that was created prior to the deletion.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves verifying the existence of the user when an API token is used for authentication, as shown in the provided commit.
- This issue is rated as "medium" severity, as it requires a deleted user with an existing API token to exploit.
