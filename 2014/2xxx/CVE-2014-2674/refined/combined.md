## Advisory:

# End-user exploitable local file inclusion vulnerability in Ajax Pagination (twitter Style) 1.1

## Vulnerability

Last revised: February 18, 2014

This plugin contains a file inclusion vulnerability that is exploitable by an unauthenticated user. The user can include any local file ending in “.php” which is accessible to the web user.

Current state:
 Reported

## CVSS Summary

CVSS base scores for this vulnerability
| Score 9.3 High | |
| --- | --- |
| Vector | Network |
| Complexity | Medium |
| Authentication | None |
| Confidentiality | Complete |
| Integrity | Complete |
| Availability | Complete |

You can read more about CVSS base scores on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVSS) or in the [CVSS specification](http://www.first.org/cvss/cvss-guide).

## Proof of concept

A non-logged in user can call the ajax function wp\_ajax\_nopriv\_ajax\_navigation that calls ajax\_navigation\_callback in [ajax-pagination-front.php at line 75](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/ajax-pagination/trunk/ajax-pagination-front.php#L75).

By setting the value of “loop” in the POST data, they can include the contents of that path on the returned page.

For example, to include the contents of wp-login.php in the returned page, send the following:

```
POST /wordpress/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
Content-Length: 53
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8

paged=2&action=ajax_navigation&loop=../../../wp-login
```
