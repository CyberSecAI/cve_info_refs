- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's `ajax_navigation_callback` function, called via `wp_ajax_nopriv_ajax_navigation`, directly includes a file path specified by the user through the "loop" POST parameter without proper sanitization or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. The plugin does not validate or sanitize user input before using it in an `include` statement.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can include any local file ending in ".php" accessible to the web server user, leading to potential information disclosure or remote code execution if the included files contain sensitive information or are executable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through HTTP POST requests to `admin-ajax.php`. The attacker sets the `action` parameter to `ajax_navigation` and the `loop` parameter to the path of the file to be included.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be a remote, unprivileged user.
