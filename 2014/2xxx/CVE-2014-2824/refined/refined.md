Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2824:

**CVE-2014-2824** is a memory corruption vulnerability found in **Internet Explorer 8**.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption that could allow for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** This is a memory corruption vulnerability which can allow an attacker to overwrite sections of memory, leading to the execution of malicious code.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new user accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted website that exploits the vulnerability.
    *   An attacker can host this malicious website and convince a user to visit it.
    *   Compromised websites and websites accepting user-provided content could also be used to host malicious content.
    *   Attackers may use phishing or social engineering techniques to trick users into visiting malicious websites.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit the malicious webpage via a link or other means.
    *   The attacker must be able to successfully corrupt memory during exploitation for code execution.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for client systems and "Moderate" for server systems.
*   The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008.
*   Microsoft's advisory indicates this vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or known to be exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   A workaround exists by disabling or prompting for Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones, or by setting the security level for those zones to "High".
*   The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
*  The vulnerability was reported by Yuki Chen of Qihoo 360.
