Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2818:

**CVE Description:** The provided information indicates that CVE-2014-2818 is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises due to Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access can corrupt memory, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Memory corruption vulnerability: The core issue lies in how Internet Explorer manages memory allocation and access.
*   Improper handling of objects in memory: The vulnerability stems from how the browser handles objects, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation can enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
*   Privilege escalation: If the current user has administrative rights, an attacker could gain complete control of the affected system.
*   Installation of malware: The attacker could install malicious programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Web-based attack: An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed with Internet Explorer.
*   Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content (including advertisements).
*   Social engineering: Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious website by clicking a link in an email, instant message, or by opening a malicious attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Ability to host a malicious website or compromise an existing one.
*   Ability to entice users to visit the malicious website using social engineering techniques.
*   No special privileges are required on the user's system besides the ability to get a user to view a malicious web page.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Internet Explorer 10 on Windows client systems and "Moderate" for Internet Explorer 10 on Windows server systems.
*   The vulnerability is not applicable to Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, 9, or 11
*   The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

In summary, CVE-2014-2818 is a critical memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer 10 that can allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted webpage. The provided content gives a clear understanding of the vulnerability's root cause, impact, attack vectors, and the necessary steps to remediate it.
