CWE-119,CWE-20,CWE-264,CWE-399,CWE-78    Email      Summary  * Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software are affected by the following vulnerabilities:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThe following products running a vulnerable version of Cisco TelePresence TC or TE Software are affected by the vulnerabilities described in this advisory:   + Cisco TelePresence MX Series   + Cisco TelePresence System EX Series   + Cisco TelePresence Integrator C Series   + Cisco TelePresence Profiles Series   + Cisco TelePresence Quick Set Series   + Cisco TelePresence System T Series   + Cisco TelePresence VX Clinical AssistantProducts Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * **Multiple SIP Denial of Service Vulnerabilities**      Multiple vulnerabilities in the SIP   code of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected system to become   unresponsive and reload.   These vulnerabilities are due to improper   handling of crafted or malformed SIP packets. An attacker could exploit   this vulnerability by sending the crafted packets to the affected   system.      These vulnerabilities can be triggered by SIP messages sent via UDP or   TCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.   The default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP   port 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061.         These vulnerabilities are documented in Cisco bug IDs [CSCud29566](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud29566) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), [CSCua64961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua64961) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), [CSCuj94651](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuj94651) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), [CSCtq72699](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq72699) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), [CSCto70562](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCto70562) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only), and [CSCua86589](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCua86589) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).         The vulnerabilities have been assigned the following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs: CVE-2014-2162, CVE-2014-2163, CVE-2014-2164, CVE-2014-2165, CVE-2014-2166 and CVE-2014-2167.      **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software DNS Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the implementation of the DNS code of Cisco   TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote   attacker to create a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary   code.      The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds check on variables. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability   by injecting crafted DNS response packets.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCty44804](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCty44804) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2168.      **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Input Validation Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the implementation of internal system scripts of the Cisco   TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an authenticated, remote   attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with the   privilege of the root user.      The vulnerability is due to the improper   validation of parameters passed to the affected system scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing   arbitrary commands as arguments to the affected scripts.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue60211](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue60211) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2169.      **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software tshell Command Injection Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the implementation of several system scripts of Cisco   TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an authenticated, remote   attacker to inject arbitrary commands with the privileges of the *root* user   via tshell (tcsh).      The vulnerability is due to the improper   implementation of the code in several scripts that can be executed on   the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   passing arbitrary commands while executing the affected scripts.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue60202](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue60202) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2170.      **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Heap Overflow Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the SIP code   of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to create a heap overflow condition. This condition could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause the affected system to reload.   The   vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted SIP packets. An   attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP packets   to the affected system.       This vulnerability can be triggered by SIP messages sent via UDP or   TCP. Messages sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) will also be affected.   The default ports for UDP and TCP deployments are UDP port 5060 and TCP   port 5060. The default port for TLS deployment is TCP port 5061.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud81796](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud81796) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2171.      **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software U-Boot Buffer Overflow Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the   implementation of executable utilities that use the universal bootloader   (u-boot) compiler of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow   an authenticated, local attacker to create a buffer overflow and   possibly execute arbitrary code on the affected system.   The   vulnerability is due to the improper implementation of internal executable files   when the u-boot compiler flag is defined. An attacker could exploit   this vulnerability by accessing the affected system command-line interface (CLI) and try to run   the affected executable files.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCub67693](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67693) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2172.      **Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software Unauthenticated Serial Port Access Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the   authentication code of Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software could allow   an unauthenticated, local attacker to connect to the serial port and obtain privileged access to the affected system.   The vulnerability is due to   the improper implementation of authentication and authorization controls for the serial port. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by   connecting to the affected port and run a series of commands.       This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCub67692](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub67692) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2173.         **Cisco TelePresence TC H.225 Denial of Service Vulnerability**    A vulnerability in the H.225 code of Cisco TelePresence TC Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the   affected system to exhaust the available memory and to reload.      The   vulnerability is due to the improper handling of crafted or malformed H.225   packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending   crafted packets to the affected system.        This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCtq78849](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtq78849) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2175.
