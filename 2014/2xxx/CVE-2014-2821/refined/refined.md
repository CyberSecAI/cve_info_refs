Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption: The core issue is that Internet Explorer doesn't handle memory access correctly, leading to memory corruption.
- Remote Code Execution: The vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the current user.
- Privilege Escalation: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability.
- Compromised websites: Attackers could inject malicious code into compromised websites or those that accept user-generated content.
- Social Engineering: Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website, usually through phishing emails or links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject content into a website: The attacker needs a platform to deliver the malicious content.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the malicious page using Internet Explorer.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is one of many memory corruption issues addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-051.
- The provided document specifies that this specific vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 8 and 9 on client and server operating systems (Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2). It does not affect Internet Explorer 6, 7, 10 or 11.
- The severity is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.

In summary, CVE-2014-2821 is a memory corruption vulnerability in older versions of Internet Explorer that can be exploited through malicious websites, potentially allowing remote code execution. The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.
