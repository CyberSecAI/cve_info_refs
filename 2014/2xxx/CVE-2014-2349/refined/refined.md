**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Improper authorization allows a local attacker with engineering-level user privileges to read and replace DeltaV configuration files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper Authorization (CWE-285)

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to read and replace configuration files and log into accounts for which they do not have correct authorization. This can likely cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is required. An attacker with engineering level user privileges can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have local access to the affected product and an engineering-level user account.
