Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2825:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. Specifically, improper access to objects in memory can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness lies in the browser's flawed memory management when dealing with specific objects. This can lead to memory corruption that can be exploited.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
-   **Privilege Escalation**: If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, and creating new accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed through Internet Explorer.
-   **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites, or websites that host user-provided content/ads, to exploit this vulnerability.
-   **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to visit the malicious website, usually by tricking them into clicking on a link in an email or instant message, or opening a malicious email attachment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Host or Inject Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a site viewed by the victim.
-   **Social Engineering Skills:** Attackers need to be able to trick users into visiting the malicious website.
-   **No Forced Action:** The attacker cannot force users to view the malicious content. The victim must take an action, such as clicking a link or opening an attachment.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients, and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed, nor was it reported as being actively exploited at the time this security bulletin was released.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 10 and 11.
- Chen Zhang (demi6od) of NSFOCUS Security Team is credited with reporting this vulnerability.
