An attacker could bypass EV SSL certificate guidelines by using a wildcard certificate. EV SSL certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CA) in compliance with Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate guidelines cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused when Internet Explorer does not properly enforce Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate guidelines, which disallow the use of wildcard certificates.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Security feature bypass due to improper enforcement of Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificate guidelines, specifically regarding wildcard certificates.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could bypass EV SSL certificate guidelines by using a wildcard certificate.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could attempt to exploit this vulnerability by obtaining a wildcard EV SSL certificate. Note that a Certificate Authority (CA) that issues a wildcard EV SSL certificate would be in non-compliance with EV SSL certificate guidelines.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to obtain a wildcard EV SSL certificate."
