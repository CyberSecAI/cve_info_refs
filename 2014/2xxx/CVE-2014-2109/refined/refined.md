Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-2109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the TCP Input module of Cisco IOS Software. It's caused by the way certain sequences of TCP packets are processed when they undergo Network Address Translation (NAT).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper processing of specific TCP packet sequences during NAT.
- This can lead to a memory leak or a device reload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
- The device may reload.
- Memory leak can occur.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Unauthenticated, remote attacker.
- Sending specific sequences of TCP packets that are processed by a NAT enabled device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to send TCP packets to a Cisco IOS device that is configured for NAT.
- No authentication required.
- The traffic must be transiting the affected device, and not destined to the device itself.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by traffic transiting an affected device, not traffic destined for it.
*   The vulnerability cannot be triggered by IPv6 traffic.
*   The advisory mentions that the memory leak can be observed using the `show memory debug leaks chunks` command. A memory leak in **IP Input** may be an indicator, but it's not a definitive sign of exploitation, as other features might also cause it.
*   There are no workarounds for the TCP Input Vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is documented under Cisco bug IDs CSCuh33843 and CSCuj41494.
*   The CVSS base score is 7.8, and the temporal score is 6.4. The CVSS vector is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C.
