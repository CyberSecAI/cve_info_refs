Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2798:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory. This improper access can lead to memory corruption, which in turn allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper handling of objects in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can execute arbitrary code with the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- Compromised websites: Attackers can inject malicious content into compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content/advertisements.
- Phishing: Attackers can trick users into clicking malicious links or opening malicious attachments delivered through email or instant messaging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject malicious content into a website and convince a user to visit that site with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- No user interaction beyond visiting the malicious site is necessary for the RCE.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer (6-11) on various Windows client and server operating systems.
- The severity rating for client systems is "Critical" and "Moderate" for server systems.
- The vulnerability was not known to be publicly exploited at the time of the bulletin's release.
- This is one of many memory corruption vulnerabilities fixed in this security bulletin, with other related CVEs.
