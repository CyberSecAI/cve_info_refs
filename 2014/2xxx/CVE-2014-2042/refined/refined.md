- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a lack of restrictions on file types that can be uploaded via the "My Projects".."Manage Project" functionality in Livetecs Timelive, combined with the fact that uploaded files are given "Read and Execute" permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload, insecure file permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the TimeLive application, potentially achieving remote code execution. In the example provided the code runs as "NETWORK_SERVICE" but this could be different depending on the configuration.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can use the "My Projects".."Manage Project" functionality available to low-level users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a low-level (standard) user account in the TimeLive application.
