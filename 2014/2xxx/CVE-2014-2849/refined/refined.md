Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by two combined flaws in the Sophos Web Protection Appliance:
1. **Mass Assignment Vulnerability:** An unprivileged authenticated user can modify the administrator's password hash due to a lack of proper access controls on the `change_password` function. This allows an attacker to change the admin password without knowing the current password.
2. **Command Injection:** When configuring a static network interface using the `netinterface` function, the appliance doesn't sanitize the input for the address field. This allows an authenticated administrator (after exploiting the first vulnerability to gain admin access) to inject and execute arbitrary commands as root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References/Mass Assignment:** The application allows an unprivileged user to modify the password of the administrator account via a mass assignment vulnerability.
*   **Command Injection:**  The application does not sanitize user input in the network interface configuration page, leading to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution as Root:** By combining the two vulnerabilities, an attacker can achieve remote code execution with root privileges on the affected Sophos Web Protection Appliance.
*   **Account takeover:** Initial password change allows for takeover of the administrator account.
*   **Potential data loss/corruption/confidentiality breach:** Having root access allows an attacker to carry out several types of malicious activity.
*   **Denial of Service:** A compromised appliance may be used to cause a denial of service.
*   **User account deletion:** As a side effect of changing the admin's password, the exploit deletes all other user accounts except for the admin account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote exploitation:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **Web interface:** The vulnerabilities are present in the web-based management interface of the Sophos Web Protection Appliance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Initial Access:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a non-privileged account on the Sophos Web Protection Appliance.
2.  **Exploit Chaining:** The attacker has to use the vulnerabilities sequentially. First exploit the mass assignment to change the admin password. Second, authenticate as the admin and trigger the command injection through the network interface configuration.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit involves modifying the admin password to a known value, then logging in as the admin.
*   The `exploit-db` entry and Metasploit module confirm this as a chain of vulnerabilities.
*   The vendor, Sophos, released a patch to address this issue, however the document is not included in this response.
*   The exploit code uses base64 encoding to inject commands.
