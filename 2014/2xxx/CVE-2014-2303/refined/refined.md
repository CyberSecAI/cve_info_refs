Root cause of vulnerability:
The webEdition CMS file browser component is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'table' and 'order' parameters within HTTP GET requests. These parameters are directly embedded into SQL queries, allowing for malicious SQL code injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input in the 'table' and 'order' parameters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- Inadequate Input Validation: The application attempts to filter the "UNION" keyword, but this is circumvented by using MySQL-specific comment syntax (/*!UNION*/).
- Lack of Output Encoding: The injected SQL queries can return sensitive information from the database, which is not properly sanitized before being included in the JavaScript response.

Impact of exploitation:
- Read-only database access: Attackers can gain read-only access to the webEdition CMS database.
- Data exfiltration: Sensitive data such as password hashes of administrative accounts can be extracted.
- Privilege escalation: If an attacker can crack the password hashes, they can gain administrative privileges.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP GET requests: The vulnerability is exploited through crafted HTTP GET requests to the file browser component (`we_fs.php`).
- Malicious parameters: The attack is achieved through the `table` and `order` parameters in the URL.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Unauthenticated access: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application.
