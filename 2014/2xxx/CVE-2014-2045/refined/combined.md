Vulnerability title: Multiple Instances Of Cross-site Scripting In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300

CVE: CVE-2014-2045

Vendor: Viprinet

Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300

Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900

Fixed version: 	2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:

	The data supplied to both the `old’ and `new’ web applications (the device has two web based management interfaces) was permanently stored and could be retrieved later by other users. This is a normal feature of many applications, however, in this instance the application failed to restrict the type of data that could be stored and also failed to sanitise it, meaning that it could not be safely rendered by the browser.

	Stored cross-site scripting could be triggered by:

		Attempting to login with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>’ (affects `old’ interface and results in post-authentication cross-site Scripting when a legitimate administrator views the realtime log)
		Creating an account with a username of `<script>alert(1)</script>’ (affects both `old’ and `new’ interfaces once created)
		Setting the device’s hostname to `<script>alert(1)</script>’  (affects `old’ interface once created)

	A number of locations were identified as being vulnerable to reflective attacks, including:

http://<host>/exec?module=config&sessionid=<sessionid>&inspect=%3Cscript%20src=http://localhost:9090%3E%3C/script%3E
http://<host>/exec?tool=atcommands&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&commands=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E
http://<host>/exec?tool=ping&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&host=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&pingcount=3&databytes=56

	The inclusion of session IDs in all URLs partially mitigates the reflective cross-site scripting but could itself be considered a vulnerability since it is included in referred headers and log files.

	These are simply some examples of how this attack might be performed, and the it is believed that both the `old’ and `new’ web applications are systemically vulnerable to this.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Vulnerability title: Multiple Instances Of Cross-site Scripting In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300
CVE: CVE-2014-2045
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version:  2014013131/2014020702

Vulnerability title: Remote SSL VPN Endpoint Identity Not Verified In Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300
CVE: CVE-2014-9754, CVE-2014-9755
Vendor: Viprinet
Product: Multichannel VPN Router 300
Affected version: 2013070830/2013080900
Fixed version:  2014013131/2014020702
Reported by: Tim Brown
Details:

        In order for the hardware VPN client on the affected device to establish a VPN channel it connects to the
remote VPN endpoint and initiates an SSL connection using TLSv1.1. It then initiates the following exchange (protocol
version 2):

client> VERSION 3
server> ERROR
client> VERSION 2
server> +OK Protocol version 2 chosen
client> TUNNEL test
server> +OK Tunnel chosen
client> PASS test
server> +OK You are now authenticated
client> CHANNEL test
server> +OK Channel selected
client> DATA

        The hardware VPN client does not validate the remote VPN endpoint identity (through the checking of the
endpoint's SSL key) before initiating the exchange.

        In this example, we perform a downgrade attack from protocol version 3 to protocol version 2, however as noted
in the impact, version 3 of the protocol is similarly affected.

        Note: MITRE have assigned CVE-2014-9754 to reference the missing certificate validation and CVE-2014-9755 to
reference the protocol downgrade attack.
