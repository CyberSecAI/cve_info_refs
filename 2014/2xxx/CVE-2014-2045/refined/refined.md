Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2045:

**Root Cause:** The Viprinet Multichannel VPN Router 300's web management interfaces (both the "old" and "new" versions) fail to properly sanitize user-supplied data before storing it. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that are later executed when other users view the stored data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. User-supplied data is stored without sanitization. This data, when viewed by other users, results in the execution of injected scripts.
*   **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The device also exhibits several reflective XSS vulnerabilities in specific URLs. These allow an attacker to inject code that executes when a user clicks a specially crafted link.
*   **Lack of input validation and sanitization:** The web applications fail to validate and sanitize user input, leading to the XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Session ID Exposure:** Session IDs are included in URLs which are potentially exposed via referrer headers and log files. This issue is not a direct cause of the XSS vulnerability but can be a separate vulnerability in itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser. This allows an attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies and session tokens
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites
    *   Deface the web interface
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user
*   **Compromise Administrator Accounts:** An attacker could potentially gain access to administrative accounts by injecting malicious code that steals credentials or performs actions on their behalf, especially through the stored XSS in the logs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Stored XSS:**
    *   Injecting `<script>` tags into usernames during login attempts. This stored XSS triggers when an admin views the logs.
    *   Injecting `<script>` tags into usernames when creating an account. This affects both interfaces, once the account is created.
    *   Injecting `<script>` tags when setting the device's hostname. This affects the old interface.
*   **Reflective XSS:**
    *   Crafting URLs with malicious JavaScript code within parameters like `inspect`, `commands`, and `host` within the `/exec` endpoint. Examples of vulnerable URLs:
        *   `http://<host>/exec?module=config&sessionid=<sessionid>&inspect=%3Cscript%20src=http://localhost:9090%3E%3C/script%3E`
        *   `http://<host>/exec?tool=atcommands&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&commands=%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`
        *  `http://<host>/exec?tool=ping&sessionid=<sessionid>&sourceobject=WANINTERFACELIST.OBJECT__0&module=configtools&host=%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%281%29%3C%2Fscript%3E&pingcount=3&databytes=56`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web interface. For the stored XSS, this includes being able to create accounts or modify device settings.
*   For the reflective XSS, the attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link.
*   No authentication is needed to trigger the reflective XSS.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker can be an unprivileged user or a malicious outsider.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory mentions that the inclusion of session IDs in URLs "partially mitigates" reflective XSS but can itself be considered a vulnerability due to session ID exposure in logs and referrer headers.
