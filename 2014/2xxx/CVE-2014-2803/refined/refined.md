Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2803:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it arises when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: Improper handling of objects in memory can lead to memory corruption. This corrupted memory can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. This means the attacker gains the same user rights as the logged-in user.
- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the affected system. They can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attacks: An attacker can host a specially crafted webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability and then convince a user to visit the site through social engineering techniques (e.g. email or instant message links).
- Compromised or malicious websites: Attackers can take advantage of compromised websites, websites that accept user-provided content, or through malicious advertisements, to deliver the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious webpage or to inject malicious content into a website.
- The attacker relies on social engineering to convince the victim to visit the malicious site.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.

**Affected Software:**
- Internet Explorer 8, 9 and 10 on various Windows client and server operating systems. Notably, IE 11 is not listed as vulnerable for this specific CVE.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed or being actively exploited when the security bulletin was released.
- Microsoft provides workarounds such as disabling or prompting for Active Scripting and using the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
