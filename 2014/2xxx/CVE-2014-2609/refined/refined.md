Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a Glassfish administrative console being accessible via HTTP on port 10001 without requiring any authentication. This lack of authentication allows unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of authentication requirements for accessing the Glassfish administrative console.
- **Insecure Port Exposure:** The administrative console is exposed on port 10001, which is accessible over HTTP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **SYSTEM User Context:** The attacker's code executes under the context of the SYSTEM user, giving the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attack is network-based, and can be performed remotely.
- **HTTP Protocol:** Exploitation is achieved via HTTP, taking advantage of the lack of authentication on port 10001.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable system.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Hewlett-Packard IT Executive Scorecard.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS provides a filter (ID '13569') to protect against this vulnerability.
- Hewlett-Packard has released an update to address this vulnerability.
