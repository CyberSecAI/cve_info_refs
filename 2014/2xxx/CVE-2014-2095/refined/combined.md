Subject: Re: CVE request for catfish program

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

> I was looking at the installed script on a Fedora 19 box

Apparently the situation is that the Fedora catfish.spec file
generates the duplicate checks for $APPNAME.py. It's uncommon to have
different CVE mappings for Fedora-shipped versions versus upstream
versions, but in this case we'll proceed to do that because the CVE
abstraction was already stated that way, and the attack vectors are
actually different.

catfish.py in the current working directory - Use CVE-2014-2093.

catfish.pyc in the current working directory - Use CVE-2014-2094.

bin/catfish.pyc under the current working directory - Use
CVE-2014-2095.

bin/catfish.py under the current working directory - Use
CVE-2014-2096.

If someone installs the upstream version of either catfish 0.4.0.2 or
catfish 0.8.2, they get a script that unsafely looks for both
catfish.pyc and catfish.py.

If someone installs either the Fedora 19 catfish-0.4.0.2-2 package or
the Fedora 20 catfish-0.8.2-1 package, they get a script that unsafely
looks for only catfish.py (twice).

This apparently occurs because of:

[Fedora 19 catfish.spec]
%{__sed} -i.byte \
        -e 's|pyc|py|' \
        %{name}.in

[Fedora 20 catfish.spec]
%{__sed} -i.byte \
        -e 's|pyc|py|' \
        bin/%{name}.in.in

We don't know why that was done. (Maybe Fedora has a policy against
certain uses of .pyc files, and this policy is implemented in
the .spec files of various packages?)

This specific case isn't very interesting because every one of the
mentioned versions of catfish on every platform is actually
vulnerable. However, probably no Fedora advisory should map to either
CVE-2014-2094 or CVE-2014-2095.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c0)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-24 22:41:48 UTC  ``` A Debian bug report [1] indicated that catfish suffers from some bad logic when loading the catfish.py script from the /usr/bin/catfish script.  This script intentionally looks to load catfish.py in the current working directory.  If a user were to run catfish in an untrusted directory that contained a malicious catfish.py, that script would be executed with the privileges of the user running catfish.  This script:  #!/usr/bin/env bash  APPNAME=catfish  if [ -e $APPNAME.py ]     then python $APPNAME.py "$@"     else         if [ -e $APPNAME.py ]             then python $APPNAME.py "$@"             else                 cd /usr/share/$APPNAME                 if [ -e $APPNAME.py ]                     then python $APPNAME.py "$@"                     else                         python $APPNAME.py "$@"                 fi         fi     fi  should probably be:  #!/bin/sh python /usr/share/catfish.py "$@"  The rest is just development fluff and very poorly written.   [1] <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=739958>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c1)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-24 22:47:50 UTC  ``` CVE request:  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/24/7>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c2)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-24 22:49:15 UTC  ```  Created catfish tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1069398](show_bug.cgi?id=1069398 "CLOSED ERRATA - catfish: insecure loading of python script [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c3)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-25 16:14:42 UTC  ``` According to:  <http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/25/2>  the assignment of CVEs looks like:  catfish.py in the current working directory - Use [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093).  catfish.pyc in the current working directory - Use [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094).  bin/catfish.pyc and bin/catfish.py file under the current working directory - Use [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095).   Based on the above, [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095) affects Fedora 20.  [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093) and [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094) affect Fedora 19.  The rationale for the two CVEs for catfish.py vs catfish.pyc in the same directory seem to be due to affects via "different versions" but MITRE never indicated what those version differences are.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c4)  Vincent Danen    2014-02-25 23:27:12 UTC  ``` More poking around by MITRE leads to the following:  catfish.py in the current working directory - Use [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093).  catfish.pyc in the current working directory - Use [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094).  bin/catfish.pyc under the current working directory - Use [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095).  bin/catfish.py under the current working directory - Use [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096).  This specific case isn't very interesting because every one of the mentioned versions of catfish on every platform is actually vulnerable. However, probably no Fedora advisory should map to either [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094) or [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095).   So essentially this issue is, for Fedora, [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093) and [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096) because we don't look for .pyc files due to some sed magic in the specfile that we're unsure of.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-26 07:44:36 UTC  ``` Let's keep the other two CVEs as alias here too.  It makes it easy to find that those issues are known and not relevant to Fedora.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c6)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-02 09:48:19 UTC  ``` Well, would you make it clear to what version of what scripts these CVEs are assigned?   It seems that [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095),2096 are assigned against catfish-1.0.0 bin/catfish.py{,c} , and maybe catfish-0.4.0.2 catfish (not catfish.py)? And to what [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093),94 apply? There is no "catfish.py" in 1.0.0 (bin/catfish.py is [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096), again?) and I don't see 0.4.0.2 "catfish.py" looks into cwd?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c7)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-02 09:49:51 UTC  ``` This question is important, so as to I can judge if changes I would apply to Fedora packages really fixes these issues.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c8)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-02 10:23:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mamoru TASAKA from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c6)) > It seems that [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095),2096 are assigned against catfish-1.0.0 > bin/catfish.py{,c} ,   And actually this not not bin/catfish.py but bin/catfish.in.in , right?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c9)  Vincent Danen    2014-03-03 22:57:36 UTC  ``` It's not so complicated.  [Comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c4) has the particulars.  For Fedora, that means:  "So essentially this issue is, for Fedora, [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093) and [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096) because we don't look for .pyc files due to some sed magic in the specfile that we're unsure of."  And from a source perspective, catfish.in.in becomes catfish.py.  Just look for where the problem is.  It's silly that four CVEs got assigned to one script, but there it is.  I would be concerned less with which CVEs are applicable as to just getting the fix out.  But in case it's important, let me re-phrase what I've already noted:  * [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096) affects Fedora 20.  * [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093) affect Fedora 19.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c10)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-04 05:54:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vincent Danen from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c9)) > And from a source perspective, catfish.in.in becomes catfish.py.  I don't see where you see here. bin/catfish is to be made from bin/catfish.in.in, but not catfish.py. And bin/catfish.py is already there and seems no relation to this.  Well, this report is very confusing and not kind to the affected maintainers...   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c11)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-04 05:57:19 UTC  ``` Again bin/catfish.py is already there (not bin/catfish.in.in), and would you again clarify if bin/catfish.py is affected?   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c12)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-04 06:52:27 UTC  ``` (To clarify:  bin/catfish.in.in generates finally bin/catfish, which is to be installed  as /usr/bin/catfish, while bin/catfish.py is installed as   /usr/share/catfish/bin/catfish.py , and /usr/bin/catfish and   /usr/share/catfish/bin/catfish.py are completely different.   What I am asking is  * [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096) is perhaps talking about bin/catfish.in.in or /usr/bin/catfish,    not bin/catfish.py or /usr/share/catfish/bin/catfish.py and I would    like you to clarify this  * And I would like you to clarify if bin/catfish.py or     /usr/share/catfish/bin/catfish.py is affected by any CVE assigned number    or not.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c13)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-04 07:06:07 UTC  ``` And note that [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094) or [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095) are strange - because (with _no_ modification as written on Fedora spec file, i.e. by default) the procedure written on "INSTALL" (as README says  "For installation instructions read INSTALL") does _NOT_ produce any .pyc files.  build.py produces .pyc files with "build" option, but the instruction  written on INSTALL does not use this option (as a result). Fedora rpm contains many .pyc files, but these are generated by  /usr/lib/rpm/brp-python-bytecompile , not the procedure by catfish installation process. So from my point of view [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094) or [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095) points to nowhere.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c14)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-03-04 08:29:19 UTC  ``` Correction to my [comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c13):  catfish-0.4.0.2 Makefile.in calls "build.py build", so  [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094) seems valid, still [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095) seems invalid.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2014-03-04 09:30:22 UTC  ``` All CVEs here are for catfish shell launcher script which basically attempts to run "python catfish.py".  In binary rpms, it's /usr/bin/catfish, while in source rpms it's catfish.in (0.4.0.2) or bin/catfish.in.in (0.8.2 and 1.0.0).  None of the CVEs is for catfish.py.  Note that there is difference between older and newer versions of that script.  catfish.in contains:  #!/usr/bin/env bash  APPNAME=catfish  if [ -e $APPNAME.pyc ]     then python $APPNAME.pyc "$@"     else         if [ -e $APPNAME.py ]             then python $APPNAME.py "$@"  and bin/catfish.in.in contains:  #!/usr/bin/env bash  APPNAME=catfish  if [ -e bin/$APPNAME.pyc ]     then %python% bin/$APPNAME.pyc "$@"     else         if [ -e bin/$APPNAME.py ]             then %python% bin/$APPNAME.py "$@"  Note that older versions try to run "python catfish.py", while newer versions attempt to run "python bin/catfish.py".  Therefore [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093) and [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094) may apply to Fedora 19 (which currently has catfish 0.4.0.2), while [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095) and [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096) may apply to Fedora 20+ (with catfish 0.8.2 or later).  Additionally, as noted in [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c4), [CVE-2014-2094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2094) and [CVE-2014-2095](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2095) are not applicable to Fedora, as catfish.spec contains the following to avoid trying to run "python catfish.pyc" and only .py extension is tried.  0.4.0.2:  %{__sed} -i.byte \         -e 's|pyc|py|' \         %{name}.in  0.8.2:  %{__sed} -i.byte \         -e 's|pyc|py|' \         bin/%{name}.in.in  Hence only [CVE-2014-2093](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2093) is really applicable to Fedora 19, and only [CVE-2014-2096](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2096) to Fedora 20.  From your point of view as maintainer, it's sufficient to know that changing the script to only do "python /full/path/to/catfish.py" is all that's needed to fix, regardless of the messy CVE assignment nuisances.  I believe that was already done, either by updating to upstream version that does, that, or by only backporting changed launcher script:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/catfish.git/commit/?h=f19&id=099b986>  Of course, the change assumes catfish does not require its CWD to be catfish installation root directory (/usr/share/catfish) for some other reason.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1069396#c16)  Vincent Danen    2014-06-04 17:56:11 UTC  ``` This has been corrected in:  * Fedora 19: catfish-0.4.0.2-4.fc19 * Fedora 20: catfish-1.0.1-1.fc20   ``` |  |

/usr/bin/catfish tries to execute bin/catfish.pyc and bin/catfish.py
from the current working directory. If you call catfish from a
world-writable directory (e.g. /tmp), malicious local user could exploit
this flaw to execute arbitrary code.

"intentionally" tends to be a complicating factor for a CVE
assignment; one could possibly instead express this as: the author
didn't consider that catfish would sometimes be executed with cwd
outside of the user's home directory. The nature of the program
suggests that it could be started interactively by any user at any
time, and there's no documentation indicating that the cwd could or
should be constrained.

We couldn't immediately figure out where your quoted source code came
from.

<http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/c/catfish/catfish_0.3.2.orig.tar.gz>
has a catfish.in that looks for $APPNAME.pyc before $APPNAME.py. The
quoted code has duplicate checks for $APPNAME.py. This affects the
number of CVEs. Apparently, "a crafted catfish.py file in the current
working directory" is an attack vector with a certain set of affected
versions, and "a crafted catfish.pyc file in the current working
directory" is an attack vector with a different set of affected
versions. Also, the Debian bug report specifically names a much later
package (1.0.0-2) that might be considered an independent codebase,
and at least has different attack vectors. The ChangeLog says "v0.6.0
Complete rewrite from the ground-up." The problematic 1.0.0 code is
distributed in bin/catfish.in.in and has attack vectors of "a crafted
bin/catfish.pyc or bin/catfish.py file under the current working
directory."

The primary Red Hat bug report refers to
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1069398> which is for
"Product: Fedora ... Component: catfish ... Version: 20" but
<http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/20/Everything/source/SRPMS/c/catfish-0.8.2-1.fc20.src.rpm>
is essentially the same as 1.0.0: the code is found in
bin/catfish.in.in in the distribution, and bin/catfish.pyc and
bin/catfish.py are the attack vectors. So, apparently your quoted code
isn't the Fedora 20 code.

Finally, we didn't find any evidence of a case where only
bin/catfish.py is checked within the post-complete-rewrite codebase.

catfish.py in the current working directory - Use CVE-2014-2093.

catfish.pyc in the current working directory - Use CVE-2014-2094.

bin/catfish.pyc and bin/catfish.py file under the current working
directory - Use CVE-2014-2095.
