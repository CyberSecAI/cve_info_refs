The provided content relates to CVE-2014-2230.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `adclick.php` and `ck.php` files of OpenX. The `MAX_redirect` function in these files does not properly validate the URL provided in the `dest` parameter before redirecting the user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect vulnerability (CWE-601)
- The `header()` function is used to redirect the user without proper URL sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can craft a malicious URL using the vulnerable parameters (`dest` for `adclick.php`, `_maxdest` for `ck.php`) to redirect users to arbitrary websites.
- This can lead to phishing attacks, where users are tricked into entering sensitive information on a fake website, or to the distribution of malware by redirecting them to a malicious download location.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting malicious URLs with the vulnerable parameters in the query string.
- Specifically, attackers can manipulate the `dest` parameter in `adclick.php` and the `_maxdest` parameter which utilizes `adclick.php` in `ck.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that includes the vulnerable parameters of `adclick.php` or `ck.php` on an OpenX system.
- No special privileges are required and the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in OpenX versions 2.8.10 and possibly earlier versions.
- The `MAX_redirect` function performs a basic check for `javascript:` or `data:` schemes, but does not sanitize other URL schemes or paths which can still lead to an open redirect.
- The CVSSv2 base score is 2.6, indicating a low-risk vulnerability, likely because user interaction is required to click on the malicious link.
