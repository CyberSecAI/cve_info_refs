    "information": "The provided document contains information about CVE-2014-2807, which is described as an \"Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability\".\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\n- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer improperly accessing objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper memory access by Internet Explorer.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution in the context of the current user.\n- An attacker could gain the same user rights as the current user.\n- If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain complete control of the affected system, including the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- A web-based attack scenario where an attacker hosts a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker then convinces a user to view the website.\n- Attackers could also use compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content/advertisements that contain the malicious code.\n- Users could be tricked into clicking a link in an email or IM message or opening a malicious attachment.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker needs to host or control a website containing the exploit or send the malicious content via email/IM.\n- The attacker needs to convince the user to visit the malicious website or open the malicious content.\n- No special privileges are needed on the target system, as the code execution happens in the context of the user."
