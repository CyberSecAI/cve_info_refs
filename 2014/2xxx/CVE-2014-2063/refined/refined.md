Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Jenkins UI was vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The application lacked proper protection against clickjacking. Specifically, it was missing the `X-Frame-Options` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially trick a user into performing unintended actions on the Jenkins UI by embedding the UI within a malicious frame. This can lead to various issues like accidental configuration changes or unintended data disclosure depending on what the user is tricked to click.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker could embed the Jenkins UI within an iframe on a malicious website they control.
- They would then overlay this iframe with transparent buttons or other UI elements that entice the victim to click.
- The victim believes they are interacting with the attacker's site when in fact they are interacting with the hidden Jenkins UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage that can be accessed by the victim
- The attacker needs the victim to have an active session on the vulnerable jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding the `X-Frame-Options` header with the value `sameorigin` to the `layout.jelly` file, thus preventing the page from being rendered in a frame on a different origin.
