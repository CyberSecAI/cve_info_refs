The provided content is related to CVE-2014-2017.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability is caused by certain request parameters that allow for HTTP request splitting.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- HTTP Request Splitting: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input within request parameters, allowing attackers to inject newline characters (%0d%0a or \r\n) to create additional HTTP headers or even a new HTTP request. This is also known as HTTP response splitting when the injection occurs in response headers.

Impact of exploitation:
- The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly detailed but HTTP Request Splitting can lead to various attacks, such as:
    - Cache poisoning: Injecting malicious content into the cache that will be served to other users.
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS): Injecting malicious scripts into the response headers or body that will be executed in the victim's browser.
    - Session hijacking: Manipulating the response headers to steal or modify user sessions.
    - Information disclosure: Injecting headers to reveal sensitive information.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is triggered through specially crafted request parameters.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with manipulated parameters to the vulnerable application.
