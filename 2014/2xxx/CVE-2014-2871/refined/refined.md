  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') (CWE-425): Many individual CFM pages within CommonSpot can be accessed directly, bypassing intended usage flows. This exposes various vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79): Many pages reflect user-supplied data unsafely, allowing for XSS attacks.",
        "Improper Access Control (CWE-284): Inconsistent enforcement of access control allows unauthorized access to many pages.",
         "Improper Authorization (CWE-285): Failure to authorize users before performing actions.",
        "External Control of File Name or Path (CWE-73): Some pages accept user-supplied file paths, leading to potential issues.",
        "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22): Vulnerability to directory traversal attacks via file name parameters.",
        "Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character (CWE-158): Allows for path manipulation using null bytes in conjunction with Path Traversal (CWE-22).",
         "Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security (CWE-602): Unsafe operations restricted only by client-side JavaScript can be bypassed.",
        "Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434): Allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary CFM pages leading to code execution.",
        "External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter (CWE-472): ColdFusion variables can be overridden via the URI.",
         "Information Exposure (CWE-200): Several pages disclose sensitive server information.",
        "Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312): Default storage of cleartext credentials.",
        "Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319): Login credentials transmitted in cleartext.",
        "Information Exposure Through Directory Listing (CWE-548):  Ability to obtain arbitrary directory listings.",
        "Information Exposure Through Log Files (CWE-532): Unauthenticated access to log file directory.",
         "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78): Unauthenticated arbitrary command execution with arbitrary parameters."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote unauthenticated attackers can achieve remote code execution on the CommonSpot/ColdFusion server with SYSTEM privileges, steal cookies used for authentication, disclose sensitive information, and gain unauthorized access to files and directories.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Directly accessing vulnerable CFM pages through web requests.",
        "Injecting malicious HTML elements via reflected XSS.",
        "Manipulating file paths using path traversal and null byte injection.",
        "Uploading arbitrary code through unrestricted file upload.",
        "Overriding ColdFusion variables via URI parameters.",
         "Executing arbitrary OS commands by exploiting command injection vulnerabilities."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Unauthenticated remote attacker. No special privileges are needed.",
      "additional_notes": "The vulnerability note provides more details than the official CVE description, including specific CWEs related to the vulnerabilities found and potential impacts. It also specifies that the issues are addressed in CommonSpot versions 7.0.2, 8.0.3, and 9.0."
