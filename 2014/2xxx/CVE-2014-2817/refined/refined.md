Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions, potentially allowing script to be run with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper permission validation in Internet Explorer.
- Elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to an elevation of privileges in affected versions of Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability itself does not allow for arbitrary code execution. However, it can be chained with other vulnerabilities that allow remote code execution to gain higher privileges. For example, code running with low integrity can be elevated to medium integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is primarily web-based.
- An attacker could host a specially crafted webpage designed to trigger the vulnerability when viewed in Internet Explorer.
- Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could also be used to host the malicious content.
- An attacker would need to convince a user to visit the malicious page, usually through a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host or inject specially crafted content onto a website that a target user will visit.
- The attacker needs to entice the user to visit the malicious page (e.g., by sending a link).
- The attacker needs to chain this vulnerability with another vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin.
- Microsoft was aware of active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the security bulletin release.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" for Windows clients and "Moderate" for Windows servers.
- The fix involves adding additional permission validations in Internet Explorer.
- A workaround of disabling active scripting can mitigate the risk at the cost of some functionality of web pages.
- The vulnerability could be mitigated using the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET).
- This CVE is associated with Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-051.
