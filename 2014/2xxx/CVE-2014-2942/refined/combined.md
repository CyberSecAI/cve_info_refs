## Cobham Aviator satellite terminals contain multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#882207

Original Release Date: 2014-08-07 | Last Revised: 2014-09-18

---

### Overview

Cobham Aviator 700D and 700E satellite terminals contain multiple vulnerabilities.

### Description

| Cobham Aviator 700D and 700E satellite communication terminals contain the following vulnerabilities:  [**CWE-327**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/327.html)**:** **Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm -** CVE-2014-2942 *(Please note that the CVE for this vulnerability has been changed from CVE-2014-2943 to CVE-2014-2942 due to a duplicate CVE identifier.)*IOActive reports that Cobham satellite terminals utilize a risky algorithm to generate a PIN code for accessing the terminal. The algorithm is reversible and allows a local attacker to generate a superuser PIN code.[**CWE-798**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html): **Use of Hard-coded Credentials** - CVE-2014-2964 IOActive reports that certain privileged commands in the the satellite terminals require a password to execute. The commands debug, prod, do160, and flrp have hardcoded passwords. A local attacker may be able to gain unauthorized privileges using these commands.The vendor Cobham has provided the following statement:*Cobham SATCOM has found that potential exploitation of the vulnerabilities presented requires either physical access to the equipment or connectivity to the maintenance part of the network, which also requires a physical presence at the terminal. Specifically, in the aeronautical world, there are very strict requirements for equipment installation and physical access to the equipment is restricted to authorized personnel.* *The described hardcoded credentials are only accessible via the maintenance port connector on the front-plate and will require direct access to the equipment via a serial port. The SDU is installed in the avionics bay of the aircraft, and is not accessible for unauthorized personnel.* *Cobham SATCOM will continue to evaluate any potential vulnerabilities with its equipment and implement increased security measures if required.* |

### Impact

| A local unauthenticated attacker may be able to gain full control of the satellite terminal. |
