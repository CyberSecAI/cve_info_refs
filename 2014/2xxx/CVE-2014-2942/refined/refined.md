The provided content relates to CVE-2014-2942.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Cobham Aviator satellite terminals utilize a weak algorithm to generate PIN codes. This algorithm is reversible, allowing the generation of a superuser PIN.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-327:** Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local, unauthenticated attacker can gain full control of the satellite terminal by generating a superuser PIN code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to the device is required. The attacker needs physical access or connectivity to the maintenance part of the network which also requires a physical presence at the terminal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs physical access to the equipment or connectivity to the maintenance part of the network.
- Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
