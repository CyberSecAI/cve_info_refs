Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2033:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Blue Coat ProxySG appliance caches local user information (passwords, user status, group membership).
*   Changes to local user accounts (password changes, deletions, user list modifications) do not take effect immediately due to caching.
*   The caching mechanism can delay the application of these changes by up to 15 minutes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability (CWE-361):** There is a window of time where the cached user data is inconsistent with the current state of the user account, allowing attackers to exploit this inconsistency.
*   **Inadequate Cache Invalidation:** The system does not immediately invalidate or update cached user information when changes occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with previously valid user credentials can still log in even after the account has been deleted or the password has been changed.
*   **Administrative Access Compromise:** If the local authentication realm is used for console access, an attacker can use the compromised credentials to gain administrative access through the Management Console, SSH, or serial console.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to access the Blue Coat ProxySG appliance's login interface (management console, SSH, serial console).
*   **Existing Credentials:** The attacker must have previously obtained valid login credentials for a local user account before the user is deleted or their password is changed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Valid Credentials:** The attacker must know a valid username and password for a local user account on the vulnerable system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the ProxySG appliance to attempt logins.
*   **Timing:** The attacker must exploit the 15-minute window before the changes to the account take effect.
