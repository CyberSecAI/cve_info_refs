- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application concatenates user-supplied input from the `i` parameter directly into SQL queries without proper validation or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can manipulate database queries to achieve unintended goals, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities. The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to control the sort order of data based on a conditional expression which includes the database version, showing that arbitrary SQL can be injected.
- **Attack vectors**: HTTP POST requests to `/xhr.php` with a malicious payload in the `i` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the functionality that uses the vulnerable `i` parameter, specifically when sorting user accounts in NodeWorx, Siteworx, and Resellers.
