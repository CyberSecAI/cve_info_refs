Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2794:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a memory corruption issue in Internet Explorer. Specifically, it arises when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper memory access can lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to improper handling of objects in memory by Internet Explorer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker could gain full control of the affected system, potentially allowing them to install programs, modify data, and create new accounts with full privileges.
- **System Compromise:** A successful exploit can lead to a complete compromise of the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a specially crafted website designed to exploit the vulnerability. They would then need to convince a user to visit the malicious site. This could involve:
    - Phishing emails with links to the malicious site.
    - Instant messages with malicious links.
    - Compromised websites that redirect to the attacker's page.
    - Malicious advertisements or user-provided content on legitimate websites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to host malicious content:** The attacker needs to be able to host or inject the exploit code into a web page that can be accessed by a user running a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker must rely on user interaction (e.g., clicking a link or opening a malicious email attachment) to trigger the vulnerability. There is no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable versions:** The attacker must target vulnerable versions of Internet Explorer specifically IE 6, and 7.

**Additional Information**

- **Affected Software:** This vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 6 and 7. Specifically:
    - Internet Explorer 6 on Windows Server 2003
    - Internet Explorer 7 on Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008.

- **Severity:** The severity is rated as Critical for Windows client systems and Moderate for Windows server systems.

- **Mitigations:**
  -  Enabling Enhanced Security Configuration on Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, and 2012 R2 mitigates this vulnerability by default.
  -  Using the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) can help to make it more difficult for attackers to exploit the vulnerability.
  -  Configuring Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disabling it in the Internet and Local Intranet zones can help protect against exploitation
  -  Setting security level for the Internet and Local intranet security zones to "High" can block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting

- **Workarounds:**
  -  Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.
  -  Add trusted sites to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone
  -  Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones

- **Patch:** Microsoft provided update KB2962872 to address this vulnerability

The provided document offers additional details regarding affected systems, mitigation, and workarounds, and confirms that the vulnerability was not known to be actively exploited at the time the bulletin was released.
