Today we released MODX Revolution 2.2.13. This is a patch release that corrects an [extremely critical security vulnerability](https://forums.modx.com/thread/89486/modx-revolution-2-x-sql-injection#dis-post-492046) that exists in all versions prior to and including 2.2.12. As this is a security release it should be considered a mandatory upgrade.

If you are unable to upgrade to 2.2.13 and are running Revolution 2.2.6 through 2.2.11 inclusive, you can replace the modx.class.php with the one from the relevant 'pl2' tag in the MODX Revolution repository. If you are running 2.2.12 you can use the [modx.class.php file from 2.2.13](https://raw.github.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.2.13-pl/core/model/modx/modx.class.php).

E.g. for v2.2.10-pl it would be:

```
https://raw.github.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.2.10-pl2/core/model/modx/modx.class.php
```

For releases prior to 2.2.6, please [contact MODX Support](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5b333e372b1b36343f2375383436) for assistance patching your version, or to get help with an upgrade to 2.2.13.

For [MODX Cloud](https://modxcloud.com/ "The Ultimate MODX Site Building & Management Platform—MODX Cloud") users, we have enabled preventative measures to protect against this vulnerability, giving you more time to upgrade your sites.

If you need help upgrading your site, please contact your website builder or find a [MODX Professional](https://modx.com/professionals).

The next patch release, [2.2.14 will include the changes](https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues?milestone=54&page=1&state=closed "Issues · modxcms/revolution · GitHub") that were originally to be in 2.2.13 in GitHub.

Here's what you need to get started or upgrade to MODX Revoluton 2.2.13:

* [Download Revolution 2.2.13](https://modx.com/download/ "Download MODX")
