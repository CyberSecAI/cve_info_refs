Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2247:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The integrated web server of the affected Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU devices does not properly neutralize script-related HTML tags in a web page, specifically in HTTP headers. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-113:** Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')
*   **HTML Header Injection**: The vulnerability is a type of header injection allowing the manipulation of the HTTP response headers. This can lead to various attacks by modifying the behavior of the webserver or the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML headers. This could have a variety of impacts, including:
    *   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):**  Although XSS is listed as a separate vulnerability (CVE-2014-2246), header injection can be a component of such attacks. By crafting a malicious header, an attacker can force the client to interpret and execute scripts that they would not expect to execute.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** By injecting headers, it may be possible to influence session handling and potentially hijack user sessions.
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Injected headers might manipulate how proxies and browsers cache content, allowing an attacker to serve malicious content even if the original server is no longer compromised.
    *   **Information disclosure:** Manipulating header could disclose sensitive information to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the integrated web server of the PLC on ports 80/TCP (HTTP) and 443/TCP (HTTPS).
*   The vulnerability requires social engineering. The attacker would likely need to entice a user to visit a specially crafted link or otherwise interact with a manipulated web server to carry out the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the device.
*   The attacker requires some level of technical expertise to craft the malicious headers and potentially set up the environment for social engineering.
*   User interaction is required.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Siemens advisory assigns a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8.
*   The ICS-CERT advisory assigns a CVSS v2 base score of 5.8 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P).
*   Siemens has released a firmware update (V1.5.0) to address this vulnerability.
