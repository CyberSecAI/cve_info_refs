Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The 050 plus for Android application outputs sensitive information to the system log file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Exposure: The application writes sensitive data to the system log, which is accessible to other applications with the appropriate permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Confidentiality Impact: An attacker can gain access to information stored by the 050 plus application. The scope of the loss is constrained.
- No impact to integrity or availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: Another application on the same Android device, with permission to read system logs, can access the exposed information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have another application installed on the same Android device, with permission to read system logs. The user needs to be tricked into installing the malicious app.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in 050 plus for Android version 4.2.0 and earlier.
- The vendor (NTT Communications) has released an updated version (4.2.1) to address the issue.
- Updating the software may not delete existing log data. Users are advised to be cautious about installing applications that can read system logs.
- The CVSS base score is 2.6 (Low), indicating a relatively low severity. This is primarily due to the high complexity (requiring a separate app with log reading permissions) and the limited impact (partial disclosure).
- The provided CVSS vector is AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N.
