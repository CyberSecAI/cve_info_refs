[What is CVSS?](/en/nav/jvnhelp.html#cvssv2)

| Measures | Severity | | | Description |
| Access Vector(AV) | Local (L) | Adjacent Network (A) | Network (N) | A vulnerability exploitable with network access means the vulnerable software is bound to the network stack and the attacker does not require local network access or local access. Such a vulnerability is often termed "remotely exploitable". |
| Access Complexity(AC) | High (H) | Medium (M) | Low (L) | Specialized access conditions exist. |
| Authentication(Au) | Multiple (M) | Single (S) | None (N) | Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability. |
| Confidentiality Impact(C) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is considerable informational disclosure. Access to some system files is possible, but the attacker does not have control over what is obtained, or the scope of the loss is constrained. |
| Integrity Impact(I) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the integrity of the system. |
| Availability Impact(A) | None (N) | Partial (P) | Complete (C) | There is no impact to the availability of the system. |

Base Score:2.6
