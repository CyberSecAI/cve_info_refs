- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of data within CIMPLICITY screen (.CIM) files, leading to a memory access violation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A memory access violation due to insufficient bounds checking when processing data from .CIM files. This is further categorized as CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a system running the affected software.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires the attacker to provide a specially crafted .CIM file to a user of the vulnerable software. This attack is not remotely exploitable and requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious .CIM file and trick a user into opening it. The attacker also needs moderate skill to exploit the vulnerability.
