This document describes multiple vulnerabilities in PaperThin CommonSpot CMS and is not related to the specified CVE.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'):** Many CFM pages can be accessed directly, bypassing intended workflows.
*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** Reflected XSS vulnerabilities exist due to improper sanitization of input.
*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** Inconsistent access control allows anonymous access to many pages.
*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization:**  Lack of authorization checks before dangerous actions.
*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** Some pages accept fully-qualified filesystem paths as parameters.
*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** Vulnerability to directory traversal attacks via filenames as parameters.
*   **CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character:** Null byte injection can be used in combination with path traversal to control the file path.
*   **CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security:** Client-side JavaScript restrictions can be bypassed.
*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** Authenticated users can upload arbitrary ColdFusion pages.
*   **CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter:** ColdFusion variables can be overridden via HTTP GET.
*   **CWE-200: Information Exposure:** Disclosure of sensitive server information including paths, SQL server type, DSNs, and admin emails.
*  **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:**  Credentials stored in the database in cleartext by default.
*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information:** Login pages transmit credentials in cleartext.
*   **CWE-548: Information Exposure Through Directory Listing:** Arbitrary directory listing possible.
*  **CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files:** Unauthenticated access to log files.
*   **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'):** Unauthenticated arbitrary command execution with arbitrary parameters.

**Root Cause:**
Multiple issues including direct access to files, insufficient input sanitization, and inconsistent access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote, unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server with SYSTEM privileges. Additional impacts include data theft, information disclosure and privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
Primarily through direct access to vulnerable CFM pages via HTTP requests and through crafted parameters in requests

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. No special position is required.

**Mitigation:**
Apply patches (versions 7.0.2, 8.0.3, and 9.0) and restrict access to the /commonspot directory.
