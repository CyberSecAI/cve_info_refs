**Verification:**

The provided document from Microsoft (docs.microsoft.com) explicitly lists **CVE-2014-2804** as an "Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability" addressed by the MS14-037 security update. Therefore, this content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an improper access of objects in memory by Internet Explorer. This can lead to memory corruption which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption vulnerability: Internet Explorer does not correctly handle objects in memory, potentially leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based attack:** An attacker can host a malicious webpage designed to exploit the vulnerability. If a user visits this page with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer, the attacker can gain control.
- **Compromised websites:** Attackers can inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that host user-provided content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host a website or inject malicious code:** An attacker needs to be able to host a website with malicious code or compromise an existing one.
- **Social engineering:** An attacker needs to convince users to visit the malicious website (e.g., through links in emails or instant messages).
- **No user interaction required after initial visit**: Once the user visits the malicious site, the exploit can happen without further user interaction.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as **Critical** for affected Windows clients, and **Moderate** for affected Windows servers.
- The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.
- This vulnerability, along with 24 other privately reported vulnerabilities and 1 public disclosure, was patched in the MS14-037 bulletin.
