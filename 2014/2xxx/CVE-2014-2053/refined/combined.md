# WordPress 3.9.2 Security Release

---

WordPress 3.9.2 is now available as a security release for all previous versions.¬†We strongly encourage you to update your sites immediately.

This release fixes a possible denial of service issue in PHP‚Äôs XML processing, reported by [Nir Goldshlager](https://twitter.com/nirgoldshlager) of the Salesforce.com Product Security Team. It¬†¬†was fixed by Michael Adams and Andrew Nacin of the WordPress security team and¬†David Rothstein of the [Drupal security team](https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-004). This is the first time our two projects have coordinated joint security releases.

WordPress 3.9.2 also contains other security changes:

* Fixes a possible but unlikely code execution when processing widgets (WordPress is not affected by default), discovered by [Alex Concha](http://www.buayacorp.com/) of the WordPress security team.
* Prevents information disclosure via XML entity attacks in the external GetID3 library, reported by [Ivan Novikov](http://onsec.ru/en/)¬†of ONSec.
* Adds protections against brute attacks against CSRF tokens, reported by [David Tomaschik](http://systemoverlord.com/) of the Google Security Team.
* Contains some additional security hardening, like preventing cross-site scripting that could be triggered only by administrators.

We appreciated responsible disclosure of these issues directly to our security team. For more information, see the [release notes](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.9.2) or consult the [list of changes](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.9?stop_rev=29383&rev=29411).

[Download WordPress 3.9.2](https://wordpress.org/download/) or venture over to **Dashboard ‚Üí Updates** and simply click ‚ÄúUpdate Now‚Äù.

Sites that support automatic background updates will be updated to WordPress 3.9.2 within 12 hours. (If you are still on WordPress 3.8.3 or 3.7.3, you will also be updated to 3.8.4 or 3.7.4. We don‚Äôt support older versions, so please update to 3.9.2 for the latest and greatest.)

Already testing WordPress 4.0? The third beta is [now available](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.0-beta3.zip) (zip) and it contains these security fixes.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
