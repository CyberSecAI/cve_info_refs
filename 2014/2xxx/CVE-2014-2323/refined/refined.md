{
  "CVE-2014-2323": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from two issues: a lax hostname validation in `request_check_hostname` allowing for malformed hostnames, and `mod_mysql_vhost` failing to sanitize user-provided hostname strings before using them in SQL queries. Specifically, when a hostname starts with '[', the code validates the IPv6 address within the brackets and checks for a closing bracket, but doesn't perform checks on any subsequent characters unless a colon is present.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "SQL Injection",
       "Path traversal",
      "Insufficient input validation",
       "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection')",
       "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or even denial of service. The path traversal vulnerability allows attackers to potentially access files outside the intended document root.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious client can send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malformed `Host` header. If the server is configured to use `mod_mysql_vhost` the unsanitized input from the Host header will be used in a database query. If the server is configured to use `mod_evhost` or `mod_simple_vhost` with specific configurations, path traversal can occur.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. No other specific capabilities are required."
  },
  "CVE-2014-2324": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lax hostname validation in `request_check_hostname` that allows for malformed hostnames which can be used to bypass directory traversal restrictions in `mod_evhost` and `mod_simple_vhost`.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
          "Path traversal",
         "Insufficient input validation",
           "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use crafted hostnames to traverse outside of the document root and read arbitrary files from the system, if specific configuration requirements are met. Specifically the code incorrectly commented with '/* check portnumber */' checks that until ']', only something resembling an IPv6 address can appear. Then it is checked that the hostname is correctly terminated with a ']'. But then, it only validates that a correct port number follows if the next char is a ':'. If the next char is anything else, the rest of the Host header is not subjected to any kind of check before being stored into con->uri.authority.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a Host header that includes directory traversal characters after a valid IPv6 format. The server then uses this unfiltered hostname to construct the path to the requested file.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server. Specific configuration of the webserver is required to be vulnerable to path traversal."
