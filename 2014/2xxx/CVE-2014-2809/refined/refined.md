Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability in Internet Explorer. Specifically, it occurs when Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is that the improper handling of objects in memory leads to memory corruption. This allows an attacker to potentially overwrite critical memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the current user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host specially crafted websites designed to exploit these vulnerabilities through Internet Explorer.
- **Compromised Websites:** Attackers can leverage compromised websites or sites that host user-provided content/ads to deliver malicious content.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to visit these malicious websites, typically by enticing them to click on a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to host or inject malicious content:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website or inject malicious code into a legitimate one.
- **Social Engineering skills:** The attacker must be able to convince a user to visit the malicious site or open a malicious attachment.
- **Technical expertise:** The attacker would require the technical ability to craft exploits that trigger the memory corruption vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" for Internet Explorer on Windows clients and "Moderate" on Windows Servers.
- This vulnerability is one of many memory corruption vulnerabilities addressed in the MS14-037 security bulletin.
- Microsoft acknowledges  `Aniway.Anyway@gmail.com, working with HP's Zero Day Initiative`, for reporting the vulnerability.
