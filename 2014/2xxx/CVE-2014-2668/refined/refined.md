Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-2668:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/uuids` endpoint of Apache CouchDB. By sending a request to this endpoint with an extremely large `count` parameter, an attacker can force the server to generate an excessive number of UUIDs, leading to high CPU and memory consumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled resource consumption: The server doesn't properly limit the number of UUIDs generated based on the `count` parameter in the `/uuids` endpoint.
- Denial of Service (DoS): By exhausting server resources, the vulnerability allows for a denial of service attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a Denial of Service (DoS). Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to high CPU and memory usage, potentially crashing the CouchDB server or making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/uuids` endpoint of a vulnerable CouchDB instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CouchDB server. No special privileges or authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker can be remote and does not need to have any prior access to the system.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit for this vulnerability is simple, requiring only a `curl` command to generate a large number of UUIDs.
- The vulnerability affects CouchDB versions up to 1.5.0.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with a single request and the server will quickly become unresponsive.
