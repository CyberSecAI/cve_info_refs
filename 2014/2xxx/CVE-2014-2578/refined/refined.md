Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2578

**Description:** A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Splunk Web.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in Splunk Web. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary web script code in the browser of a user who clicks on a maliciously crafted link.
*   This can potentially lead to actions performed under the context of the logged-in user's session within Splunk Web. This can include data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted link.
*   The link can be placed on any external page, where an authenticated Splunk user might click on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated Splunk Web user into clicking this link. This can be done through social engineering or by embedding the link on an external site the victim is likely to visit.

**Affected Products and Components:**
*   Splunk version 5.0.7 and all older versions.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Splunk version 5.0.8 or later.
*   Apply Hardening Standards from the Securing Splunk documentation.
