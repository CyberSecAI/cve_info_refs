Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2286:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by unbounded allocation of memory on the stack when parsing HTTP Cookie headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `ast_http_get_cookies` function in `main/http.c` iterates through HTTP headers, and for each "Cookie" header, it creates a copy of the header value on the stack using `ast_strdupa` (which uses `alloca`). This copy is then passed to the `parse_cookies` function to parse cookie name-value pairs.
- The `alloca` function allocates memory on the stack, and the amount allocated depends on the length of the cookie value.
- The number of cookie headers is not limited by the code.
- Repeatedly sending a large number of Cookie headers with long values in an HTTP request leads to excessive stack allocation and overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by overflowing the stack of the thread handling the HTTP request. This can lead to the thread crashing, and depending on the server architecture, can possibly crash the whole server.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Although not confirmed, the advisory notes that the vulnerability could potentially be exploited for RCE on platforms where no guard page is allocated to prevent threads from overlapping each other's stack. This is due to the fact that `alloca()` is followed by a `memcpy()`, so by overwriting adjacent memory locations on the stack, it is potentially possible to achieve RCE. However, this was not achieved on glibc systems that have thread stack guard pages enabled.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request (typically a POST request) to the Asterisk server.
- The request must contain a large number of "Cookie" headers with long values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication to the Asterisk server.
- The attacker can be remotely located and send the malicious HTTP request over the network.
