## Advisory:

# CSRF vulnerability in WP HTML Sitemap 1.2

## Vulnerability

Last revised: February 26, 2014

A CSRF vulnerability exists which allows an attacker to delete the sitemap if a logged-in admin user visits a link of the attacker’s choosing.

Line 202 of inc/AdminPage.php says “// check whether form was just submitted” but the following if/elseif statements only check whether a particular button was pressed without checking nonce values. The form in question is printed in wp\_html\_sitemap\_AdminPage::createSitemapForm() around line 146 of the same file.

Current state:
 Reported

## Proof of concept

This form deletes the sitemap without requiring a nonce value:

```
<form action="http://not-a-real-site.local/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wp-html-sitemap&tab=general" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="deleteSitemap" value="Delete Sitemap">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```
