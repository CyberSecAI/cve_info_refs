- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin `WP HTML Sitemap` version 1.2 does not implement proper nonce validation when deleting the sitemap. Specifically, the code only checks if a particular button was pressed, without verifying nonce values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability due to missing nonce checks in the form submission handling for deleting the sitemap.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting the sitemap by visiting a crafted link or web page. This can lead to data loss and affect the website's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious form that submits a request to delete the sitemap. This form is then presented to a logged-in administrator, often through a disguised link or webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to visit a page containing the malicious form. The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the website itself, but relies on a logged-in administrator visiting the crafted link.
