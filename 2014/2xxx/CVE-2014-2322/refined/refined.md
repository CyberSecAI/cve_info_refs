Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `Arabic-Prawn` Ruby gem (version 0.0.1) passes unsanitized input to the shell through the `%x{}` command execution. Specifically, the `url` and `downloaded_file` variables are incorporated into shell commands without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By including shell meta-characters (e.g., `;`) within the `url` or `downloaded_file` variables, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server where the vulnerable gem is used. This can lead to a complete compromise of the server.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially use command execution to access sensitive data, modify system files, install malware, or launch further attacks.
*   **Denial of Service:** The attacker could also execute commands leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL or file name containing shell meta-characters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over URL or Filename:** The attacker must be able to control or influence the value of the `url` or `downloaded_file` variables used by the vulnerable code.
*   **Use of Vulnerable Gem:** The attacker needs the target application to use the vulnerable version of the `Arabic-Prawn` gem.

**Vulnerable Code Locations:**

The following code snippets within `/lib/string_utf_support.rb` are vulnerable:
```ruby
426 var = %x{ /usr/bin/curl -I -L --fail --silent --connect-timeout #{seconds} --max-time #{seconds+10} #{url}; /bin/echo -n $? }.to_i
...
431   str = %x{ /usr/bin/curl -L --fail --silent --connect-timeout #{seconds} --max-time #{seconds+10} #{url} | \
432           /usr/bin/grep -Eo -m 1 \"(charset|encoding)=[\\"']?[^\\"'>]+\" | /usr/bin/grep -Eo \"[^=\\"    '>]+$\" }
...
443   %x{ /usr/bin/touch #{downloaded_file} 2>/dev/null }
...
445   %x{ /usr/bin/curl -L --fail --silent --connect-timeout #{seconds} --max-time #{seconds+10} -o #{downloaded_file} #{url} }
...
447  simple_test = %x{ /usr/bin/file -ik #{downloaded_file} }
```

**Proof of Concept:**

A file name like `myfile;id;.txt` or a URL containing `;id` would cause the `id` command to be executed on the server.
