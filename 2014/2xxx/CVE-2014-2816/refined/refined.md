    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in SharePoint Server. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could use a specially crafted app to run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when SharePoint Server does not properly handle a specially crafted app that uses the SharePoint extensibility model to execute arbitrary JavaScript on behalf of the user. Conditions exist where an app could bypass app permission management and run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper sanitization of specially crafted apps",
       "Bypass of app permission management"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted app to execute arbitrary script in the security context of the logged-on user. The script could then, for example, take actions on the affected SharePoint site on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the logged-on user.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted app",
      "User interaction (convincing users to install the crafted app)"
