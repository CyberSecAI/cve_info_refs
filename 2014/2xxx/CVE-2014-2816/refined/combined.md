**Version:** 1.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint Server. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could use a specially crafted app to run arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user on the current SharePoint site.

This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013 and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2013. For more information, see the **Affected and Non-Affected Software** section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SharePoint Server sanitizes specially crafted applications (apps) that use custom actions. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability later in this bulletin.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

## Update FAQ

**What if an app stops working or does not install properly after installing this update?**

Because this update corrects how SharePoint sanitizes apps, some apps, particularly those that use custom actions, may stop working or not install properly after installing this update. Evaluate apps that stop working or that do not install properly on a case-by-case basis. If the app is from an untrusted source or is no longer needed, you should remove the app. For more information about removing apps, see [Remove app for SharePoint instances from a SharePoint 2013 site](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/fp161233). **Warning** After you remove an app, you will not be able to recover any data that the app may be storing in the location where it is hosted. If you want to keep this data, you must save it before you remove the app. Go to the app you plan to remove, and manually copy the data to another format (some apps may provide you with a way to export data).

On the other hand, if the app is one you trust and want to keep using, check trusted sources or contact the app author for an updated version that functions and installs correctly.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Service Pack Lifecycle Support Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an , Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, see the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) website, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## SharePoint Page Content Vulnerability - CVE-2014-2816

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in SharePoint Server. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could use a specially crafted app to run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2014-2816](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2014-2816).

### Mitigating Factors

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **For SharePoint instances, evaluate and remove apps as appropriate. Install new apps from trusted sources only.**

  Evaluate installed apps on a case-by-case basis and remove those that were installed from untrusted sources and those that are not needed anymore. You should also evaluate apps installed from trusted sources to see if the app has been removed from the trusted source. If an app has been removed from the trusted source, this may be an indication that the app is now considered untrusted and you should remove the app from your SharePoint instances.

  For more information, see [Remove app for SharePoint instances from a SharePoint 2013 site](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/fp161233).

  After removing apps installed from untrusted sources, install new apps as needed from trusted sources only.

  **Impact of workaround** When administrators remove apps for SharePoint from SharePoint sites, the apps are uninstalled and functionality is no longer available to users.

  **Warning** After you remove an app, you will not be able to recover any data that the app may be storing in the location where it is hosted. If you want to keep this data, you must save it before you remove the app. Go to the app you plan to remove, and manually copy the data to another format (some apps may provide you with a way to export data).

### FAQ

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when SharePoint Server does not properly handle a specially crafted app that uses the SharePoint extensibility model to execute arbitrary JavaScript on behalf of the user. Conditions exist where an app could bypass app permission management and run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user.

**What is app permissions management?**

The purpose of app permissions management is to manage the ability of apps to access and use internal SharePoint 2013 resources and perform tasks on behalf of users. For more information, see [Plan app permissions management in SharePoint 2013](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj219576).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a specially crafted app to execute arbitrary script in the security context of the logged-on user. The script could then, for example, take actions on the affected SharePoint site on behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the logged-on user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could create a specially crafted app designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince users to install the specially crafted app.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems running an affected version of SharePoint Server that allow connections from apps that implement the affected feature set are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how SharePoint Server sanitizes specially crafted apps that use custom actions.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability were being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance

Several resources are available to help administrators deploy security updates.

* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) lets administrators scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and common security misconfigurations.
* Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), Systems Management Server (SMS), and System Center Configuration Manager help administrators distribute security updates.
* The Update Compatibility Evaluator components included with Application Compatibility Toolkit aid in streamlining the testing and validation of Windows updates against installed applications.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
