How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Summary
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Vendor: BlackBerry
Products known to be affected:
\* Blackberry Z10 model STL100-2
Software release: 10.1.0.2312
OS version: 10.1.0.2354
Build ID: 524717
Severity: Medium
Remote exploitable: Yes
CVE: CVE-2014-2388
The mobile phone offers a network service ("Storage and Access") for
adhoc file-exchange [1] between the phone and a network client [2].
To achieve these goals, the mobile device deploys a Samba fileserver,
which can be used to upload or download files to or from the
Blackberry phone. To enable fileserver access from wireless networks,
the user has to explicitly enable "Access using Wi-Fi" on the phone.
Afterwards, the Z10 asks the user to enter a password that is
required to get access to the fileserver. The fileserver
implementation or the password handling that is used on the Z10 is
affected by an authentication by-pass vulnerability: The fileserver
fails to ask for a password and allows unauthenticated users to
obtain read and write access to the offered shares. The severity is
considered medium to high, as an attacker may be able to distribute
targeted malware or access confidential data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Details
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The problem occurs, when "Sharing via Wi-Fi" has been enabled on the
Z10. The "Storage and Access" dialog of the Z10 asks the user for a
password that shall be used to access data on the fileserver. Under
certain circumstances, the fileserver fails to ask for a password and
allows access even without specifying credentials. This behaviour
does not always occur but is reproducible within at most one of ten
different tries via Wi-Fi.
The following lists describe the steps of different methods to
reproduce the issue. The fist approach let users access the
fileserver via the wireless LAN interface without using the developer
mode, which is the most common scenario. The second approach gives
access via USB cable. In this second approach, the developer mode is
activated to enable TCP/IP communication via USB. The second method
is more reliable for reproducing the effect and for tracking down the
root cause.
The root cause of the vulnerability is not known at the time of this
writing. The test was performed with an Ubuntu Linux as a network
client. References to specific Linux tools are presented for the sake
of completeness.
3.1 Method 1
Prepare the phone:
1. Disconnect all cables
2. Open Settings / "Storage and Access" and make sure "Access using
Wi-Fi" is turned off. This is not strictly necessary, but
recommended to reproduce the effect.
3. Power down the phone.
The process to reproduce the problem:
1. Boot the phone.
2. Enter the PIN for the SIM card.
3. Enter the device password.
4. Open Settings
5. Open "Network Connections". Make sure that Wi-Fi is enabled and
the phone is a client in a wireless LAN. In the test environment,
the client IP address is 10.0.0.149.
6. For the tests, "Mobile Hotspot" is "Not Connected" and "Internet
Tethering" is off. This setting is likely not critical.
7. Open "Storage and Access".
8. Enable "Access using Wi-Fi" on the phone. The phone will ask
for a password. Use a password, which you never used before
(for the server) to make sure, that credentials are not loaded
from the Gnome keychain.
9. Open Nautilus with: nautilus smb://10.0.0.149
10. If Nautilus fails to display a lost of shares, close Nautilus and
open it again.
11. Try to access a share. If the server asks for a password, disable
"Access using Wi-Fi", reboot the phone and try again.
3.2 Method 2
Prepare the phone:
1. Connect phone to the PC via USB cable
2. Open Settings / "Storage and Access" and make sure "Access using
Wi-Fi" is turned off.
3. Power down the phone.
The process to reproduce the problem:
1. Boot the phone.
2. Enter the PIN for the SIM card.
3. Enter the device password.
4. Open Settings
5. Open "Network Connections". Make sure that Wi-Fi is switched off,
"Mobile Hotspot" is "Not Connected" and "Internet Tethering" is
off.
6. Open "Development Mode" and enable it. The phone's IP address is
set to 169.254.0.1.
7. Wait for the message: "Developer mode active ...".
8. Wait for the message: "Connected to PC ...".
9. Open "Storage and Access", make sure "Access using Wi-Fi" is
disabled.
10. Open the Gnome file browser Nautilus from the command line with:
nautilus smb://169.254.0.1
11. If Nautilus does not show any share, close Nautilus and open it
again. If it is still empty, repeat the step.
12. Try to open a share: Nautilus will ask for a password. Click
cancel. Nautilus will just ask again, press Cancel, again. This
is expected behavior.
13. Close Nautilus
14. Open Nautilus, again, and leave the Nautilus window open.
15. Enable "Access using Wi-Fi" on the phone. The phone will ask for
a password. Use a password, which you never used before (for the
server) to make sure, that credentials are not stored in the Gnome
keychain.
16. Click on a share, again. The share will be opened without asking
for a password.
17. Disconnect share and open Nautilus again with:
nautilus smb://169.254.0.1
18. Open a share. Nautilus will show the contents of the share.
19. Create a folder and create a file.
Shutdown process:
1. Disconnect shares
2. Disable "Access using Wi-Fi" in the phone's settings.
3. Shut down the phone.
A video of a demonstration is available at [3].
---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Impact
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The authentication by-pass results in read and write access to
enabled shares. Thus, sensitive data may be accessed by unauthorized
