Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2108:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Cisco IOS and IOS XE software handle malformed IKEv2 packets. Specifically, the software does not properly process certain malformed IKEv2 packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper processing of malformed IKEv2 packets.
- Lack of sufficient input validation/error handling within the IKEv2 module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause a reload of the affected device.
- This reload leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, disrupting network services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- The attacker sends malformed IKEv2 packets to the vulnerable device.
- The attack can be launched over IPv4 or IPv6.
- The vulnerable ports are UDP 500 and UDP 4500 (for NAT-T).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
- No authentication is required.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft malformed IKEv2 packets.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the IKEv2 module, which is used for negotiating cryptographic attributes in IPsec.
- ISAKMP must be enabled for the device to be vulnerable (IKEv2 is automatically enabled when ISAKMP is enabled).
- The vulnerability is triggered only by malformed IKEv2 packets, not normal IKEv2 packets.
- The vulnerability is not triggered by IKEv1 packets.
- Devices are vulnerable regardless of whether any IKEv2 specific features are configured, as long as ISAKMP is enabled.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco IOS Software
- Cisco IOS XE Software

**Unaffected Products:**
- Cisco IOS XR Software
- Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance

**Workarounds:**
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability. The only solution is to apply the appropriate patch.
