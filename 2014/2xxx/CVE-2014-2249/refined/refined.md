Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-2249:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in the integrated web server of the Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPU families.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The web server of the affected PLCs (accessible via ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP) does not properly validate the origin of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful CSRF attacks could compromise the integrity and availability of the affected devices. An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on the device, if a logged in user is tricked into clicking a malicious link or accessing a malicious website that sends forged requests to the PLC.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, leveraging the web server interface of the PLC. The attacker must trick a logged in user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send malicious requests to the web server of the PLC. This can be done via a malicious link or a malicious website. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the PLC webserver, but rather needs a user that is already logged in to execute the CSRF attack. The attacker requires a moderate skill level to exploit this vulnerability.
