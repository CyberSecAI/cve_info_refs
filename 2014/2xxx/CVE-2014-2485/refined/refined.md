**CVE-2014-3797**
*   **Root cause:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in VMware vCenter Server Appliance (vCSA).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** XSS.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session when they are logged into vCenter, potentially leading to actions on the user's behalf and/or access to sensitive data.
*   **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or opening a malicious webpage while logged into vCenter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft and deliver malicious URLs or webpages to targeted users.

**CVE-2014-8371**
*   **Root cause:** vCenter Server does not properly validate certificates when establishing a connection to a CIM server on an ESXi host.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper certificate validation.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Allows for man-in-the-middle attacks against the CIM service, potentially leading to the interception of sensitive data or the manipulation of the CIM service.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Man-in-the-middle attack during connection to the CIM service.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be positioned in the network to intercept communications between vCenter and ESXi hosts.

**CVE-2013-2877 & CVE-2014-0191**
*   **Root cause:** Security issues in the libxml2 package.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Vulnerabilities in the libxml2 library.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**  Potentially allows a malicious actor to exploit vulnerabilities present in libxml2 through the ESXi.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Exploitation through use of the vulnerable library
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to interact with ESXi through the use of the library.
