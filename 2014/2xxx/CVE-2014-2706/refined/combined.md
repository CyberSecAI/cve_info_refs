PNP / ACPI: proper handling of ACPI IO/Memory resource parsing failures
commit 89935315f192abf7068d0044cefc84f162c3c81f upstream.
Before commit b355cee88e3b (ACPI / resources: ignore invalid ACPI
device resources), if acpi\_dev\_resource\_memory()/acpi\_dev\_resource\_io()
returns false, it means the the resource is not a memeory/IO resource.
But after commit b355cee88e3b, those functions return false if the
given memory/IO resource entry is invalid (the length of the resource
is zero).
This breaks pnpacpi\_allocated\_resource(), because it now recognizes
the invalid memory/io resources as resources of unknown type. Thus
users see confusing warning messages on machines with zero length
ACPI memory/IO resources.
Fix the problem by rearranging pnpacpi\_allocated\_resource() so that
it calls acpi\_dev\_resource\_memory() for memory type and IO type
resources only, respectively.
Fixes: b355cee88e3b (ACPI / resources: ignore invalid ACPI device resources)

memcg: reparent charges of children before processing parent
commit 4fb1a86fb5e4209a7d4426d4e586c58e9edc74ac upstream.
Sometimes the cleanup after memcg hierarchy testing gets stuck in
mem\_cgroup\_reparent\_charges(), unable to bring non-kmem usage down to 0.
There may turn out to be several causes, but a major cause is this: the
workitem to offline parent can get run before workitem to offline child;
parent's mem\_cgroup\_reparent\_charges() circles around waiting for the
child's pages to be reparented to its lrus, but it's holding
cgroup\_mutex which prevents the child from reaching its
mem\_cgroup\_reparent\_charges().
Further testing showed that an ordered workqueue for cgroup\_destroy\_wq
is not always good enough: percpu\_ref\_kill\_and\_confirm's call\_rcu\_sched
stage on the way can mess up the order before reaching the workqueue.
Instead, when offlining a memcg, call mem\_cgroup\_reparent\_charges() on
all its children (and grandchildren, in the correct order) to have their
charges reparented first.

arm64: mm: Add double logical invert to pte accessors
commit 84fe6826c28f69d8708bd575faed7f75e6b6f57f upstream.
Page table entries on ARM64 are 64 bits, and some pte functions such as
pte\_dirty return a bitwise-and of a flag with the pte value. If the
flag to be tested resides in the upper 32 bits of the pte, then we run
into the danger of the result being dropped if downcast.
For example:
gather\_stats(page, md, pte\_dirty(\*pte), 1);
where pte\_dirty(\*pte) is downcast to an int.
This patch adds a double logical invert to all the pte\_ accessors to
ensure predictable downcasting.

bio-integrity: Fix bio\_integrity\_verify segment start bug
commit 5837c80e870bc3b12ac6a98cdc9ce7a9522a8fb6 upstream.
This patch addresses a bug in bio\_integrity\_verify() code that has
been causing DIF READ verify operations to be silently skipped.
The issue is that bio->bi\_idx will have been incremented within
bio\_advance() code in the normal blk\_update\_request() ->
req\_bio\_endio() completion path, and bio\_integrity\_verify() is
using bio\_for\_each\_segment() which starts the bio segment walk
at the current bio->bi\_idx.
So instead use bio\_for\_each\_segment\_all() to always start the bio
segment walk from zero, regardless of the current bio->bi\_idx
value after bio\_advance() has been called.

Btrfs: fix data corruption when reading/updating compressed extents
commit a2aa75e18a21b21952dc6daa9bac7c9f4426f81f upstream.
When using a mix of compressed file extents and prealloc extents, it
is possible to fill a page of a file with random, garbage data from
some unrelated previous use of the page, instead of a sequence of zeroes.
A simple sequence of steps to get into such case, taken from the test
case I made for xfstests, is:
\_scratch\_mkfs
\_scratch\_mount "-o compress-force=lzo"
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0x06 -b 18670 266978 18670" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foobar
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "falloc 26450 665194" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foobar
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "truncate 542872" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foobar
$XFS\_IO\_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH\_MNT/foobar
This results in the following file items in the fs tree:
item 4 key (257 INODE\_ITEM 0) itemoff 15879 itemsize 160
inode generation 6 transid 6 size 542872 block group 0 mode 100600
item 5 key (257 INODE\_REF 256) itemoff 15863 itemsize 16
inode ref index 2 namelen 6 name: foobar
item 6 key (257 EXTENT\_DATA 0) itemoff 15810 itemsize 53
extent data disk byte 0 nr 0 gen 6
extent data offset 0 nr 24576 ram 266240
extent compression 0
item 7 key (257 EXTENT\_DATA 24576) itemoff 15757 itemsize 53
prealloc data disk byte 12849152 nr 241664 gen 6
prealloc data offset 0 nr 241664
item 8 key (257 EXTENT\_DATA 266240) itemoff 15704 itemsize 53
extent data disk byte 12845056 nr 4096 gen 6
extent data offset 0 nr 20480 ram 20480
extent compression 2
item 9 key (257 EXTENT\_DATA 286720) itemoff 15651 itemsize 53
prealloc data disk byte 13090816 nr 405504 gen 6
prealloc data offset 0 nr 258048
The on disk extent at offset 266240 (which corresponds to 1 single disk block),
contains 5 compressed chunks of file data. Each of the first 4 compress 4096
bytes of file data, while the last one only compresses 3024 bytes of file data.
Therefore a read into the file region [285648 ; 286720[ (length = 4096 - 3024 =
1072 bytes) should always return zeroes (our next extent is a prealloc one).
The solution here is the compression code path to zero the remaining (untouched)
bytes of the last page it uncompressed data into, as the information about how
much space the file data consumes in the last page is not known in the upper layer
fs/btrfs/extent\_io.c:\_\_do\_readpage(). In \_\_do\_readpage we were correctly zeroing
the remainder of the page but only if it corresponds to the last page of the inode
and if the inode's size is not a multiple of the page size.
This would cause not only returning random data on reads, but also permanently
storing random data when updating parts of the region that should be zeroed.
For the example above, it means updating a single byte in the region [285648 ; 286720[
would store that byte correctly but also store random data on disk.
A test case for xfstests follows soon.

Btrfs: fix tree mod logging
commit 5de865eebb8330eee19c37b31fb6f315a09d4273 upstream.
While running the test btrfs/004 from xfstests in a loop, it failed
about 1 time out of 20 runs in my desktop. The failure happened in
the backref walking part of the test, and the test's error message was
like this:

But immediately after the test finished, the btrfs inspect-internal command
returned the expected output:

inode 405 offset 454656 root 258

It turned out this was because the btrfs\_search\_old\_slot() calls performed
during backref walking (backref.c:\_\_resolve\_indirect\_ref) were not finding
anything. The reason for this turned out to be that the tree mod logging
code was not logging some node multi-step operations atomically, therefore
btrfs\_search\_old\_slot() callers iterated often over an incomplete tree that
wasn't fully consistent with any tree state from the past. Besides missing
items, this often (but not always) resulted in -EIO errors during old slot
searches, reported in dmesg like this:

These tree mod log operations that must be performed atomically, tree\_mod\_log\_free\_eb,
tree\_mod\_log\_eb\_copy, tree\_mod\_log\_insert\_root and tree\_mod\_log\_insert\_move, used to
be performed atomically before the following commit:
c8cc6341653721b54760480b0d0d9b5f09b46741
(Btrfs: stop using GFP\_ATOMIC for the tree mod log allocations)
That change removed the atomicity of such operations. This patch restores the
atomicity while still not doing the GFP\_ATOMIC allocations of tree\_mod\_elem
structures, so it has to do the allocations using GFP\_NOFS before acquiring
the mod log lock.
This issue has been experienced by several users recently, such as for example:
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg28574.html
After running the btrfs/004 test for 679 consecutive iterations with this
patch applied, I didn't ran into the issue anymore.

Btrfs: return immediately if tree log mod is not necessary
commit 783577663507411e36e459390ef056556e93ef29 upstream.
In ctree.c:tree\_mod\_log\_set\_node\_key() we were calling
\_\_tree\_mod\_log\_insert\_key() even when the modification doesn't need
to be logged. This would allocate a tree\_mod\_elem structure, fill it
and pass it to \_\_tree\_mod\_log\_insert(), which would just acquire
the tree mod log write lock and then free the tree\_mod\_elem structure
and return (that is, a no-op).
Therefore call tree\_mod\_log\_insert() instead of \_\_tree\_mod\_log\_insert()
which just returns immediately if the modification doesn't need to be
logged (without allocating the structure, fill it, acquire write lock,
free structure).

x86, fpu: Check tsk\_used\_math() in kernel\_fpu\_end() for eager FPU
commit 731bd6a93a6e9172094a2322bd0ee964bb1f4d63 upstream.
For non-eager fpu mode, thread's fpu state is allocated during the first
fpu usage (in the context of device not available exception). This
(math\_state\_restore()) can be a blocking call and hence we enable
interrupts (which were originally disabled when the exception happened),
allocate memory and disable interrupts etc.
But the eager-fpu mode, call's the same math\_state\_restore() from
kernel\_fpu\_end(). The assumption being that tsk\_used\_math() is always
set for the eager-fpu mode and thus avoid the code path of enabling
interrupts, allocating fpu state using blocking call and disable
interrupts etc.
But the below issue was noticed by Maarten Baert, Nate Eldredge and
few others:
If a user process dumps core on an ecrypt fs while aesni-intel is loaded,
we get a BUG() in \_\_find\_get\_block() complaining that it was called with
interrupts disabled; then all further accesses to our ecrypt fs hang
and we have to reboot.
The aesni-intel code (encrypting the core file that we are writing) needs
the FPU and quite properly wraps its code in kernel\_fpu\_{begin,end}(),
the latter of which calls math\_state\_restore(). So after kernel\_fpu\_end(),
interrupts may be disabled, which nobody seems to expect, and they stay
that way until we eventually get to \_\_find\_get\_block() which barfs.
For eager fpu, most the time, tsk\_used\_math() is true. At few instances
during thread exit, signal return handling etc, tsk\_used\_math() might
be false.
In kernel\_fpu\_end(), for eager-fpu, call math\_state\_restore()
only if tsk\_used\_math() is set. Otherwise, don't bother. Kernel code
path which cleared tsk\_used\_math() knows what needs to be done
with the fpu state.

SCSI: isci: correct erroneous for\_each\_isci\_host macro
commit c59053a23d586675c25d789a7494adfdc02fba57 upstream.
In the first place, the loop 'for' in the macro 'for\_each\_isci\_host'
(drivers/scsi/isci/host.h:314) is incorrect, because it accesses
the 3rd element of 2 element array. After the 2nd iteration it executes
the instruction:
ihost = to\_pci\_info(pdev)->hosts[2]
(while the size of the 'hosts' array equals 2) and reads an
out of range element.
In the second place, this loop is incorrectly optimized by GCC v4.8
(see http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=138998871911336&w=2).
As a result, on platforms with two SCU controllers,
the loop is executed more times than it can be (for i=0,1 and 2).
It causes kernel panic during entering the S3 state
and the following oops after 'rmmod isci':
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at (null)

SCSI: isci: fix reset timeout handling
commit ddfadd7736b677de2d4ca2cd5b4b655368c85a7a upstream.
Remove an erroneous BUG\_ON() in the case of a hard reset timeout. The
reset timeout handler puts the port into the "awaiting link-up" state.
The timeout causes the device to be disconnected and we need to be in
the awaiting link-up state to re-connect the port. The BUG\_ON() made
the incorrect assumption that resets never timeout and we always
complete the reset in the "resetting" state.
Testing this patch also uncovered that libata continues to attempt to
reset the port long after the driver has torn down the context. Once
the driver has committed to abandoning the link it must indicate to
libata that recovery ends by returning -ENODEV from
->lldd\_I\_T\_nexus\_reset().

net: unix socket code abuses csum\_partial
commit 0a13404dd3bf4ea870e3d96270b5a382edca85c0 upstream.
The unix socket code is using the result of csum\_partial to
hash into a lookup table:
unix\_hash\_fold(csum\_partial(sunaddr, len, 0));
csum\_partial is only guaranteed to produce something that can be
folded into a checksum, as its prototype explains:
\* returns a 32-bit number suitable for feeding into itself
\* or csum\_tcpudp\_magic
The 32bit value should not be used directly.
Depending on the alignment, the ppc64 csum\_partial will return
different 32bit partial checksums that will fold into the same
16bit checksum.
This difference causes the following testcase (courtesy of
Gustavo) to sometimes fail:
#include
#include
int main()
{
int fd = socket(PF\_LOCAL, SOCK\_STREAM|SOCK\_CLOEXEC, 0);
int i = 1;
setsockopt(fd, SOL\_SOCKET, SO\_REUSEADDR, &i, 4);
struct sockaddr addr;
addr.sa\_family = AF\_LOCAL;
bind(fd, &addr, 2);
listen(fd, 128);
struct sockaddr\_storage ss;
socklen\_t sslen = (socklen\_t)sizeof(ss);
getsockname(fd, (struct sockaddr\*)&ss, &sslen);
fd = socket(PF\_LOCAL, SOCK\_STREAM|SOCK\_CLOEXEC, 0);
if (connect(fd, (struct sockaddr\*)&ss, sslen) == -1){
perror(NULL);
return 1;
}
printf("OK\n");
return 0;
}
As suggested by davem, fix this by using csum\_fold to fold the
partial 32bit checksum into a 16bit checksum before using it.

dm cache: fix access beyond end of origin device
commit e893fba90c09f9b57fb97daae204ea9cc2c52fa5 upstream.
In order to avoid wasting cache space a partial block at the end of the
origin device is not cached. Unfortunately, the check for such a
partial block at the end of the origin device was flawed.
Fix accesses beyond the end of the origin device that occured due to
attempted promotion of an undetected partial block by:
- initializing the per bio data struct to allow cache\_end\_io to work properly
- recognizing access to the partial block at the end of the origin device
- avoiding out of bounds access to the discard bitset
Otherwise, users can experience errors like the following:

dm cache: fix truncation bug when copying a block to/from >2TB fast device
commit 8b9d96666529a979acf4825391efcc7c8a3e9f12 upstream.
During demotion or promotion to a cache's >2TB fast device we must not
truncate the cache block's associated sector to 32bits. The 32bit
temporary result of from\_cblock() caused a 32bit multiplication when
calculating the sector of the fast device in issue\_copy\_real().
Use an intermediate 64bit type to store the 32bit from\_cblock() to allow
for proper 64bit multiplication.
Here is an example of how this bug manifests on an ext4 filesystem:
EXT4-fs error (device dm-0): ext4\_mb\_generate\_buddy:756: group 17136, 32768 clusters in bitmap, 30688 in gd; block bitmap corrupt.

dm space map metadata: fix refcount decrement below 0 which caused corruption
commit cebc2de44d3bce53e46476e774126c298ca2c8a9 upstream.
This has been a relatively long-standing issue that wasn't nailed down
until Teng-Feng Yang's meticulous bug report to dm-devel on 3/7/2014,
see: http://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2014-March/msg00021.html
From that report:
"When decreasing the reference count of a metadata block with its
reference count equals 3, we will call dm\_btree\_remove() to remove
this enrty from the B+tree which keeps the reference count info in
metadata device.
The B+tree will try to rebalance the entry of the child nodes in each
node it traversed, and the rebalance process contains the following
steps.
(1) Finding the corresponding children in current node (shadow\_current(s))
(2) Shadow the children block (issue BOP\_INC)
(3) redistribute keys among children, and free children if necessary (issue BOP\_DEC)
Since the update of a metadata block's reference count could be
recursive, we will stash these reference count update operations in
smm->uncommitted and then process them in a FILO fashion.
The problem is that step(3) could free the children which is created
in step(2), so the BOP\_DEC issued in step(3) will be carried out
before the BOP\_INC issued in step(2) since these BOPs will be
processed in FILO fashion. Once the BOP\_DEC from step(3) tries to
decrease the reference count of newly shadow block, it will report
failure for its reference equals 0 before decreasing. It looks like we
can solve this issue by processing these BOPs in a FIFO fashion
instead of FILO."
Commit 5b564d80 ("dm space map: disallow decrementing a reference count
below zero") changed the code to report an error for this temporary
refcount decrement below zero. So what was previously a harmless
invalid refcount became a hard failure due to the new error path:
device-mapper: space map common: unable to decrement a reference count below 0
device-mapper: thin: 253:6: dm\_thin\_insert\_block() failed: error = -22
device-mapper: thin: 253:6: switching pool to read-only mode
This bug is in dm persistent-data code that is common to the DM thin and
cache targets. So any users of those targets should apply this fix.
Fix this by applying recursive space map operations in FIFO order rather
than FILO.

mm/compaction: break out of loop on !PageBuddy in isolate\_freepages\_block
commit 2af120bc040c5ebcda156df6be6a66610ab6957f upstream.
We received several reports of bad page state when freeing CMA pages
previously allocated with alloc\_contig\_range:
BUG: Bad page state in process Binder\_A pfn:63202
page:d21130b0 count:0 mapcount:1 mapping: (null) index:0x7dfbf
page flags: 0x40080068(uptodate|lru|active|swapbacked)
Based on the page state, it looks like the page was still in use. The
page flags do not make sense for the use case though. Further debugging
showed that despite alloc\_contig\_range returning success, at least one
page in the range still remained in the buddy allocator.
There is an issue with isolate\_freepages\_block. In strict mode (which
CMA uses), if any pages in the range cannot be isolated,
isolate\_freepages\_block should return failure 0. The current check
keeps track of the total number of isolated pages and compares against
the size of the range:
if (strict && nr\_strict\_required > total\_isolated)
total\_isolated = 0;
After taking the zone lock, if one of the pages in the range is not in
the buddy allocator, we continue through the loop and do not increment
total\_isolated. If in the last iteration of the loop we isolate more
than one page (e.g. last page needed is a higher order page), the check
for total\_isolated may pass and we fail to detect that a page was
skipped. The fix is to bail out if the loop immediately if we are in
strict mode. There's no benfit to continuing anyway since we need all
pages to be isolated. Additionally, drop the error checking based on
nr\_strict\_required and just check the pfn ranges. This matches with
what isolate\_freepages\_range does.

vmxnet3: fix netpoll race condition
commit d25f06ea466ea521b563b76661180b4e44714ae6 upstream.
vmxnet3's netpoll driver is incorrectly coded. It directly calls
vmxnet3\_do\_poll, which is the driver internal napi poll routine. As the netpoll
controller method doesn't block real napi polls in any way, there is a potential
for race conditions in which the netpoll controller method and the napi poll
method run concurrently. The result is data corruption causing panics such as this
one recently observed:

The fix is to do as other drivers do, and have the poll controller call the top
half interrupt handler, which schedules a napi poll properly to recieve frames
Tested by myself, successfully.

PCI: Enable INTx in pci\_reenable\_device() only when MSI/MSI-X not enabled
commit 3cdeb713dc66057b50682048c151eae07b186c42 upstream.
Andreas reported that after 1f42db786b14 ("PCI: Enable INTx if BIOS left
them disabled"), pciehp surprise removal stopped working.
This happens because pci\_reenable\_device() on the hotplug bridge (used in
the pciehp\_configure\_device() path) clears the Interrupt Disable bit, which
apparently breaks the bridge's MSI hotplug event reporting.
Previously we cleared the Interrupt Disable bit in do\_pci\_enable\_device(),
which is used by both pci\_enable\_device() and pci\_reenable\_device(). But
we use pci\_reenable\_device() after the driver may have enabled MSI or
MSI-X, and we \*set\* Interrupt Disable as part of enabling MSI/MSI-X.
This patch clears Interrupt Disable only when MSI/MSI-X has not been
enabled.

ibmveth: Fix endian issues with MAC addresses
commit d746ca9561440685edb62614d1bcbbc27ff50e66 upstream.
The code to load a MAC address into a u64 for passing to the
hypervisor via a register is broken on little endian.
Create a helper function called ibmveth\_encode\_mac\_addr
which does the right thing in both big and little endian.
We were storing the MAC address in a long in struct ibmveth\_adapter.
It's never used so remove it - we don't need another place in the
driver where we create endian issues with MAC addresses.

KVM: SVM: fix cr8 intercept window
commit 596f3142d2b7be307a1652d59e7b93adab918437 upstream.
We always disable cr8 intercept in its handler, but only re-enable it
if handling KVM\_REQ\_EVENT, so there can be a window where we do not
intercept cr8 writes, which allows an interrupt to disrupt a higher
priority task.
Fix this by disabling intercepts in the same function that re-enables
them when needed. This fixes BSOD in Windows 2008.

ipc: Fix 2 bugs in msgrcv() MSG\_COPY implementation
commit 4f87dac386cc43d5525da7a939d4b4e7edbea22c upstream.
While testing and documenting the msgrcv() MSG\_COPY flag that Stanislav
Kinsbursky added in commit 4a674f34ba04 ("ipc: introduce message queue
copy feature" => kernel 3.8), I discovered a couple of bugs in the
implementation. The two bugs concern MSG\_COPY interactions with other
msgrcv() flags, namely:
(A) MSG\_COPY + MSG\_EXCEPT
(B) MSG\_COPY + !IPC\_NOWAIT
The bugs are distinct (and the fix for the first one is obvious),
however my fix for both is a single-line patch, which is why I'm
combining them in a single mail, rather than writing two mails+patches.
===== (A) MSG\_COPY + MSG\_EXCEPT =====
With the addition of the MSG\_COPY flag, there are now two msgrcv()
flags--MSG\_COPY and MSG\_EXCEPT--that modify the meaning of the 'msgtyp'
argument in unrelated ways. Specifying both in the same call is a
logical error that is currently permitted, with the effect that MSG\_COPY
has priority and MSG\_EXCEPT is ignored. The call should give an error
if both flags are specified. The patch below implements that behavior.
===== (B) (B) MSG\_COPY + !IPC\_NOWAIT =====
The test code that was submitted in commit 3a665531a3b7 ("selftests: IPC
message queue copy feature test") shows MSG\_COPY being used in
conjunction with IPC\_NOWAIT. In other words, if there is no message at
the position 'msgtyp'. return immediately with the error in ENOMSG.
What was not (fully) tested is the behavior if MSG\_COPY is specified
\*without\* IPC\_NOWAIT, and there is an odd behavior. If the queue
contains less than 'msgtyp' messages, then the call blocks until the
next message is written to the queue. At that point, the msgrcv() call
returns a copy of the newly added message, regardless of whether that
message is at the ordinal position 'msgtyp'. This is clearly bogus, and
problematic for applications that might want to make use of the MSG\_COPY
flag.
I considered the following possible solutions to this problem:
(1) Force the call to block until a message \*does\* appear at the
position 'msgtyp'.
(2) If the MSG\_COPY flag is specified, the kernel should implicitly add
IPC\_NOWAIT, so that the call fails with ENOMSG for this case.
(3) If the MSG\_COPY flag is specified, but IPC\_NOWAIT is not, generate
an error (probably, EINVAL is the right one).
I do not know if any application would really want to have the
functionality of solution (1), especially since an application can
determine in advance the number of messages in the queue using msgctl()
IPC\_STAT. Obviously, this solution would be the most work to implement.
Solution (2) would have the effect of silently fixing any applications
that tried to employ broken behavior. However, it would mean that if we
later decided to implement solution (1), then user-space could not
easily detect what the kernel supports (but, since I'm somewhat doubtful
that solution (1) is needed, I'm not sure that this is much of a
problem).
Solution (3) would have the effect of informing broken applications that
they are doing something broken. The downside is that this would cause
a ABI breakage for any applications that are currently employing the
broken behavior. However:
a) Those applications are almost certainly not getting the results they
expect.
b) Possibly, those applications don't even exist, because MSG\_COPY is
currently hidden behind CONFIG\_CHECKPOINT\_RESTORE.
The upside of solution (3) is that if we later decided to implement
solution (1), user-space could determine what the kernel supports, via
the error return.
In my view, solution (3) is mildly preferable to solution (2), and
solution (1) could still be done later if anyone really cares. The
patch below implements solution (3).
PS. For anyone out there still listening, it's the usual story:
documenting an API (and the thinking about, and the testing of the API,
that documentation entails) is the one of the single best ways of
finding bugs in the API, as I've learned from a lot of experience. Best
to do that documentation before releasing the API.

By the time dname\_to\_vma\_addr() returns 0 the corresponding vma may have

This patch fixes a bug in iscsit\_get\_tpg\_from\_np() where the
tpg->tpg\_state sanity check was looking for TPG\_STATE\_FREE,
instead of != TPG\_STATE\_ACTIVE.
The latter is expected during a normal TPG shutdown once the
tpg\_state goes into TPG\_STATE\_INACTIVE in order to reject any
new incoming login attempts.

mm/readahead.c: fix do\_readahead() for no readpage(s)
commit 58d5640ebdb273cc817b0d0cda7bcf2efbbc2ff7 upstream.
Commit 63d0f0a3c7e1 ("mm/readahead.c:do\_readhead(): don't check for
->readpage") unintentionally made do\_readahead return 0 for all valid
files regardless of whether readahead was supported, rather than the
expected -EINVAL. This gets forwarded on to userspace, and results in
sys\_readahead appearing to succeed in cases that don't make sense (e.g.
when called on pipes or sockets). This issue is detected by the LTP
readahead01 testcase.
As the exact return value of force\_page\_cache\_readahead is currently
never used, we can simplify it to return only 0 or -EINVAL (when
readpage or readpages is missing). With that in place we can simply
forward on the return value of force\_page\_cache\_readahead in
do\_readahead.
This patch performs said change, restoring the expected semantics.

iser-target: Fix command leak for tx\_desc->comp\_llnode\_batch
commit ebbe442183b7b8192c963266f1c89048fefc63a5 upstream.
This patch addresses a number of active I/O shutdown issues
related to isert\_cmd descriptors being leaked that are part
of a completion interrupt coalescing batch.
This includes adding logic in isert\_cq\_tx\_comp\_err() to
drain any associated tx\_desc->comp\_llnode\_batch, as well
as isert\_cq\_drain\_comp\_llist() to drain any associated
isert\_conn->conn\_comp\_llist.
Also, set tx\_desc->llnode\_active in isert\_init\_send\_wr()
in order to determine when work requests need to be skipped
in isert\_cq\_tx\_work() exception path code.
Finally, update isert\_init\_send\_wr() to only allow interrupt
coalescing when ISER\_CONN\_UP.

iser-target: Fix post\_send\_buf\_count for RDMA READ/WRITE
commit b6b87a1df604678ed1be40158080db012a99ccca upstream.
This patch fixes the incorrect setting of ->post\_send\_buf\_count
related to RDMA WRITEs + READs where isert\_rdma\_rw->send\_wr\_num
was not being taken into account.
This includes incrementing ->post\_send\_buf\_count within
isert\_put\_datain() + isert\_get\_dataout(), decrementing within
\_\_isert\_send\_completion() + isert\_response\_completion(), and
clearing wr->send\_wr\_num within isert\_completion\_rdma\_read()
This is necessary because even though IB\_SEND\_SIGNALED is
not set for RDMA WRITEs + READs, during a QP failure event
the work requests will be returned with exception status
from the TX completion queue.

iscsi/iser-target: Fix isert\_conn->state hung shutdown issues
commit defd884845297fd5690594bfe89656b01f16d87e upstream.
This patch addresses a couple of different hug shutdown issues
related to wait\_event() + isert\_conn->state. First, it changes
isert\_conn->conn\_wait + isert\_conn->conn\_wait\_comp\_err from
waitqueues to completions, and sets ISER\_CONN\_TERMINATING from
within isert\_disconnect\_work().
Second, it splits isert\_free\_conn() into isert\_wait\_conn() that
is called earlier in iscsit\_close\_connection() to ensure that
all outstanding commands have completed before continuing.
Finally, it breaks isert\_cq\_comp\_err() into seperate TX / RX
related code, and adds logic in isert\_cq\_rx\_comp\_err() to wait
for outstanding commands to complete before setting ISER\_CONN\_DOWN
and calling complete(&isert\_conn->conn\_wait\_comp\_err).

ACPI / sleep: Add extra checks for HW Reduced ACPI mode sleep states
commit a4e90bed511220ff601d064c9e5d583e91308f65 upstream.
If the HW Reduced ACPI mode bit is set in the FADT, ACPICA uses
the optional sleep control and sleep status registers for making
the system enter sleep states (including S5), so it is not possible
to use system sleep states or power it off using ACPI if the HW
Reduced ACPI mode bit is set and those registers are not available.
For this reason, add a new function, acpi\_sleep\_state\_supported(),
checking if the HW Reduced ACPI mode bit is set and whether or not
system sleep states are usable in that case in addition to checking
the return value of acpi\_get\_sleep\_type\_data() and make the ACPI
sleep setup routines use that function to check the availability of
system sleep states.
Among other things, this prevents the kernel from attempting to
use ACPI for powering off HW Reduced ACPI systems without the sleep
control and sleep status registers, because ACPI power off doesn't
have a chance to work on them. That allows alternative power off
mechanisms that may actually work to be used on those systems. The
affected machines include Dell Venue 8 Pro, Asus T100TA, Haswell
Desktop SDP and Ivy Bridge EP Demo depot.

cpufreq: Skip current frequency initialization for ->setpolicy drivers
commit 2ed99e39cb9392312c100d9da591c20641c64d12 upstream.
After commit da60ce9f2fac (cpufreq: call cpufreq\_driver->get() after
calling ->init()) \_\_cpufreq\_add\_dev() sometimes fails for CPUs handled
by intel\_pstate, because that driver may return 0 from its ->get()
callback if it has not run long enough to collect enough samples on the
given CPU. That didn't happen before commit da60ce9f2fac which added
policy->cur initialization to \_\_cpufreq\_add\_dev() to help reduce code
duplication in other cpufreq drivers.
However, the code added by commit da60ce9f2fac need not be executed
for cpufreq drivers having the ->setpolicy callback defined, because
the subsequent invocation of cpufreq\_set\_policy() will use that
callback to initialize the policy anyway and it doesn't need
policy->cur to be initialized upfront. The analogous code in
cpufreq\_update\_policy() is also unnecessary for cpufreq drivers
having ->setpolicy set and may be skipped for them as well.
Since intel\_pstate provides ->setpolicy, skipping the upfront
policy->cur initialization for cpufreq drivers with that callback
set will cover intel\_pstate and the problem it's been having after
commit da60ce9f2fac will be addressed.

cpufreq: use cpufreq\_cpu\_get() to avoid cpufreq\_get() race conditions
commit 999976e0f6233322a878b0b7148c810544d6c8a8 upstream.
If a module calls cpufreq\_get while cpufreq is initializing, it's
possible for it to be called after cpufreq\_driver is set but before
cpufreq\_cpu\_data is written during subsys\_interface\_register. This
happens because cpufreq\_get doesn't take the cpufreq\_driver\_lock
around its use of cpufreq\_cpu\_data.
Fix this by using cpufreq\_cpu\_get(cpu) to look up the policy rather
than reading it out of cpufreq\_cpu\_data directly. cpufreq\_cpu\_get()
takes the appropriate locks to prevent this race from happening.
Since it's possible for policy to be NULL if the caller passes in an
invalid CPU number or calls the function before cpufreq is initialized,
delete the BUG\_ON(!policy) and simply return 0. Don't try to return
-ENOENT because that's negative and the function returns an unsigned
integer.

NFSv4: nfs4\_stateid\_is\_current should return 'true' for an invalid stateid
commit e1253be0ece1a95a02c7f5843194877471af8179 upstream.
When nfs4\_set\_rw\_stateid() can fails by returning EIO to indicate that
the stateid is completely invalid, then it makes no sense to have it
trigger a retry of the READ or WRITE operation. Instead, we should just
have it fall through and attempt a recovery.
This fixes an infinite loop in which the client keeps replaying the same
bad stateid back to the server.

spi: spi-ath79: fix initial GPIO CS line setup
commit 61d1cf163c8653934cc8cd5d0b2a562d0990c265 upstream.
The 'ath79\_spi\_setup\_cs' function initializes the chip
select line of a given SPI device in order to make sure
that the device is inactive.
If the SPI\_CS\_HIGH bit is set for a given device, it
means that the CS line of that device is active HIGH
so it must be set to LOW initially. In case of GPIO
CS lines, the 'ath79\_spi\_setup\_cs' function does the
opposite of that due to the wrong GPIO flags.
Fix the code to use the correct GPIO flags.

firewire: don't use PREPARE\_DELAYED\_WORK
commit 70044d71d31d6973665ced5be04ef39ac1c09a48 upstream.
PREPARE\_[DELAYED\_]WORK() are being phased out. They have few users
and a nasty surprise in terms of reentrancy guarantee as workqueue
considers work items to be different if they don't have the same work
function.
firewire core-device and sbp2 have been been multiplexing work items
with multiple work functions. Introduce fw\_device\_workfn() and
sbp2\_lu\_workfn() which invoke fw\_device->workfn and
sbp2\_logical\_unit->workfn respectively and always use the two
functions as the work functions and update the users to set the
->workfn fields instead of overriding work functions using
PREPARE\_DELAYED\_WORK().
This fixes a variety of possible regressions since a2c1c57be8d9
"workqueue: consider work function when searching for busy work items"
due to which fw\_workqueue lost its required non-reentrancy property.

firewire: ohci: fix probe failure with Agere/LSI controllers
commit 0ca49345b6f489e95f8d6edeb0b092e257475b2a upstream.
Since commit bd972688eb24
"firewire: ohci: Fix 'failed to read phy reg' on FW643 rev8",
there is a high chance that firewire-ohci fails to initialize LSI née
Agere controllers.
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=65151
Peter Hurley points out the reason: IEEE 1394a:2000 clause 5A.1 (or
IEEE 1394:2008 clause 17.2.1) say: "The PHY shall insure that no more
than 10 ms elapse from the reassertion of LPS until the interface is
reset. The link shall not assert LReq until the reset is complete."
In other words, the link needs to give the PHY at least 10 ms to get
the interface operational.
With just the msleep(1) in bd972688eb24, the first read\_phy\_reg()
during ohci\_enable() may happen before the phy-link interface reset was
finished, and fail. Due to the high variability of msleep(n) with small
n, this failure was not fully reproducible, and not apparent at all with
low CONFIG\_HZ setting.
On the other hand, Peter can no longer reproduce the issue with FW643
rev8. The read phy reg failures that happened back then may have had an
unrelated cause. So, just revert bd972688eb24, except for the valid
comment on TSB82AA2 cards.

tracing: Do not add event files for modules that fail tracepoints
commit 45ab2813d40d88fc575e753c38478de242d03f88 upstream.
If a module fails to add its tracepoints due to module tainting, do not
create the module event infrastructure in the debugfs directory. As the events
will not work and worse yet, they will silently fail, making the user wonder
why the events they enable do not display anything.
Having a warning on module load and the events not visible to the users
will make the cause of the problem much clearer.

ACPI / EC: Clear stale EC events on Samsung systems
commit ad332c8a45330d170bb38b95209de449b31cd1b4 upstream.
A number of Samsung notebooks (530Uxx/535Uxx/540Uxx/550Pxx/900Xxx/etc)
continue to log events during sleep (lid open/close, AC plug/unplug,
battery level change), which accumulate in the EC until a buffer fills.
After the buffer is full (tests suggest it holds 8 events), GPEs stop
being triggered for new events. This state persists on wake or even on
power cycle, and prevents new events from being registered until the EC
is manually polled.
This is the root cause of a number of bugs, including AC not being
detected properly, lid close not triggering suspend, and low ambient
light not triggering the keyboard backlight. The bug also seemed to be
responsible for performance issues on at least one user's machine.
Juan Manuel Cabo found the cause of bug and the workaround of polling
the EC manually on wake.
The loop which clears the stale events is based on an earlier patch by
Lan Tianyu (see referenced attachment).
This patch:
- Adds a function acpi\_ec\_clear() which polls the EC for stale \_Q
events at most ACPI\_EC\_CLEAR\_MAX (currently 100) times. A warning is
logged if this limit is reached.
- Adds a flag EC\_FLAGS\_CLEAR\_ON\_RESUME which is set to 1 if the DMI
system vendor is Samsung. This check could be replaced by several
more specific DMI vendor/product pairs, but it's likely that the bug
affects more Samsung products than just the five series mentioned
above. Further, it should not be harmful to run acpi\_ec\_clear() on
systems without the bug; it will return immediately after finding no
data waiting.
- Runs acpi\_ec\_clear() on initialisation (boot), from acpi\_ec\_add()
- Runs acpi\_ec\_clear() on wake, from acpi\_ec\_unblock\_transactions()

ACPI / resources: ignore invalid ACPI device resources
commit b355cee88e3b1a193f0e9a81db810f6f83ad728b upstream.
ACPI table may export resource entry with 0 length.
But the current code interprets this kind of resource in a wrong way.
It will create a resource structure with
res->end = acpi\_resource->start + acpi\_resource->len - 1;
This patch fixes a problem on my machine that a platform device fails
to be created because one of its ACPI IO resource entry (start = 0,
end = 0, length = 0) is translated into a generic resource with
start = 0, end = 0xffffffff.

genirq: Remove racy waitqueue\_active check
commit c685689fd24d310343ac33942e9a54a974ae9c43 upstream.
We hit one rare case below:
T1 calling disable\_irq(), but hanging at synchronize\_irq()
always;
The corresponding irq thread is in sleeping state;
And all CPUs are in idle state;
After analysis, we found there is one possible scenerio which
causes T1 is waiting there forever:
CPU0 CPU1
synchronize\_irq()
wait\_event()
spin\_lock()
atomic\_dec\_and\_test(&threads\_active)
insert the \_\_wait into queue
spin\_unlock()
if(waitqueue\_active)
atomic\_read(&threads\_active)
wake\_up()
Here after inserted the \_\_wait into queue on CPU0, and before
test if queue is empty on CPU1, there is no barrier, it maybe
cause it is not visible for CPU1 immediately, although CPU0 has
updated the queue list.
It is similar for CPU0 atomic\_read() threads\_active also.
So we'd need one smp\_mb() before waitqueue\_active.that, but removing
the waitqueue\_active() check solves it as wel l and it makes
things simple and clear.

usb: Make DELAY\_INIT quirk wait 100ms between Get Configuration requests
commit d86db25e53fa69e3e97f3b55dd82a70689787c5d upstream.
The DELAY\_INIT quirk only reduces the frequency of enumeration failures
with the Logitech HD Pro C920 and C930e webcams, but does not quite
eliminate them. We have found that adding a delay of 100ms between the
first and second Get Configuration request makes the device enumerate
perfectly reliable even after several weeks of extensive testing. The
reasons for that are anyone's guess, but since the DELAY\_INIT quirk
already delays enumeration by a whole second, wating for another 10th of
that isn't really a big deal for the one other device that uses it, and
it will resolve the problems with these webcams.

usb: Add device quirk for Logitech HD Pro Webcams C920 and C930e
commit e0429362ab15c46ea4d64c3f8c9e0933e48a143a upstream.
We've encountered a rare issue when enumerating two Logitech webcams
after a reboot that doesn't power cycle the USB ports. They are spewing
random data (possibly some leftover UVC buffers) on the second
(full-sized) Get Configuration request of the enumeration phase. Since
the data is random this can potentially cause all kinds of odd behavior,
and since it occasionally happens multiple times (after the kernel
issues another reset due to the garbled configuration descriptor), it is
not always recoverable. Set the USB\_DELAY\_INIT quirk that seems to work
around the issue.

x86: Ignore NMIs that come in during early boot
commit 5fa10196bdb5f190f595ebd048490ee52dddea0f upstream.
Don Zickus reports:
A customer generated an external NMI using their iLO to test kdump
worked. Unfortunately, the machine hung. Disabling the nmi\_watchdog
made things work.
I speculated the external NMI fired, caused the machine to panic (as
expected) and the perf NMI from the watchdog came in and was latched.
My guess was this somehow caused the hang.
----
It appears that the latched NMI stays latched until the early page
table generation on 64 bits, which causes exceptions to happen which
end in IRET, which re-enable NMI. Therefore, ignore NMIs that come in
during early execution, until we have proper exception handling.

commit 30c219710358c5cca2f8bd2e9e547c6aadf7cf8b upstream.
There are some direct ops->enable in the regulator core driver. This is
a potential issue as the function \_regulator\_do\_enable() handles gpio
regulators and the normal ops->enable calls. These gpio regulators are
simply ignored when ops->enable is called directly.
One possible bug is that boot-on and always-on gpio regulators are not
enabled on registration.
This patch replaces all ops->enable calls by \_regulator\_do\_enable.

Since we do this, we don't need to mess around in asm/memory.h with

powerpc/tm: Fix crash when forking inside a transaction
commit 621b5060e823301d0cba4cb52a7ee3491922d291 upstream.
When we fork/clone we currently don't copy any of the TM state to the new
thread. This results in a TM bad thing (program check) when the new process is
switched in as the kernel does a tmrechkpt with TEXASR FS not set. Also, since
R1 is from userspace, we trigger the bad kernel stack pointer detection. So we
end up with something like this:
Bad kernel stack pointer 0 at c0000000000404fc
cpu 0x2: Vector: 700 (Program Check) at [c00000003ffefd40]
pc: c0000000000404fc: restore\_gprs+0xc0/0x148

paca = 0xc00000000fe00800 softe: 0 irq\_happened: 0x01
pid = 0, comm = swapper/2
WARNING: exception is not recoverable, can't continue
The below fixes this by flushing the TM state before we copy the task\_struct to
the clone. To do this we go through the tmreclaim patch, which removes the
checkpointed registers from the CPU and transitions the CPU out of TM suspend
mode. Hence we need to call tmrechkpt after to restore the checkpointed state
and the TM mode for the current task.
To make this fail from userspace is simply:

pinctrl: sunxi: use chained\_irq\_{enter, exit} for GIC compatibility
commit 905a5117e79367b7e58ae046d12ca9961f048c89 upstream.
On tha Allwinner A20 SoC, the external interrupts on the pin controller
device are connected to the GIC. Without chained\_irq\_{enter, exit},
external GPIO interrupts, such as used by mmc core card detect, cause
the system to hang.
This issue was first encountered during my attempt to get out-of-band
interrupts for WiFi on the Cubietruck working. With David's new series
of sunci-mci using mmc slot-gpio for (GPIO interrupt based) card
detection, removing the SD card also causes my Cubietruck to hang. This
problem should extend to all Allwinner A20 based boards.
With this fix, the system no longer hangs when I remove or insert the
SD card. /proc/interrupts show that the interrupt has correctly fired.
However the system still does not detect card removal/insertion. I
believe this is another unrelated issue.

ALSA: hda - Fix loud click noise with IdeaPad 410Y
commit 9b745ab897199c2af9f21ca9681ef86d5b971002 upstream.
Lenovo IdeaPad 410Y with ALC282 codec makes loud click noises at boot
and shutdown. Also, it wrongly misdetects the acpi\_thinkpad hook.
This patch adds a device-specific fixup for disabling the shutup
callback that is the cause of the click noise and also avoiding the
thinpad\_helper calls.

drm/radeon: TTM must be init with cpu-visible VRAM, v2
commit 14eedc32a3c0ec9dd70448a73763ee21feae3111 upstream.
Without this, a bo may get created in the cpu-inaccessible vram.
Before the CP engines get setup, all copies are done via cpu memcpy.
This means that the cpu tries to read from inaccessible memory, fails,
and the radeon module proceeds to disable acceleration.
Doing this has no downsides, as the real VRAM size gets set as soon as the
CP engines get init.
This is a candidate for 3.14 fixes.

iwlwifi: mvm: change of listen interval from 70 to 10
commit e7eb65cac0720df8b3946af7f7a9dc363cf0a814 upstream.
Some APs reject STA association request if a listen interval value exceeds
a threshold of 10. Thus, for example, Cisco APs may deny STA associations
returning status code 12 (Association denied due to reason outside the scope
of 802.11 standard) in the association response frame.
Fixing the issue by setting the default IWL\_CONN\_MAX\_LISTEN\_INTERVAL value
from 70 to 10.

ath9k: fix invalid descriptor discarding

Only set sc->rx.discard\_next to rx\_stats->rs\_more when actually
discarding the current descriptor.
Also, fix a detection of broken descriptors:
First the code checks if the current descriptor is not done.
Then it checks if the next descriptor is done.
Add a check that afterwards checks the first descriptor again, because
it might have been completed in the mean time.

mac80211: don't validate unchanged AP bandwidth while tracking
commit 963a1852fbac4f75a2d938fa2e734ef1e6d4c044 upstream.
The MLME code in mac80211 must track whether or not the AP changed
bandwidth, but if there's no change while tracking it shouldn't do
anything, otherwise regulatory updates can make it impossible to
connect to certain APs if the regulatory database doesn't match the
information from the AP. See the precise scenario described in the
code.
This still leaves some possible problems with CSA or if the AP
actually changed bandwidth, but those cases are less common and
won't completely prevent using it.

mac80211: fix AP powersave TX vs. wakeup race
commit 1d147bfa64293b2723c4fec50922168658e613ba upstream.
There is a race between the TX path and the STA wakeup: while
a station is sleeping, mac80211 buffers frames until it wakes
up, then the frames are transmitted. However, the RX and TX
path are concurrent, so the packet indicating wakeup can be
processed while a packet is being transmitted.
This can lead to a situation where the buffered frames list
is emptied on the one side, while a frame is being added on
the other side, as the station is still seen as sleeping in
the TX path.
As a result, the newly added frame will not be send anytime
soon. It might be sent much later (and out of order) when the
station goes to sleep and wakes up the next time.
Additionally, it can lead to the crash below.
Fix all this by synchronising both paths with a new lock.
Both path are not fastpath since they handle PS situations.
In a later patch we'll remove the extra skb queue locks to
reduce locking overhead.

macvlan: Add support for 'always\_on' offload features
[ Upstream commit 8b4703e9bd1172a5f8244276ebb94302e6153e26 ]
Macvlan currently inherits all of its features from the lower
device. When lower device disables offload support, this causes
macvlan to disable offload support as well. This causes
performance regression when using macvlan/macvtap in bridge
mode.
It can be easily demonstrated by creating 2 namespaces using
macvlan in bridge mode and running netperf between them:
MIGRATED TCP STREAM TEST from 0.0.0.0 (0.0.0.0) port 0 AF\_INET to 10.0.0.1 () port 0 AF\_INET

bytes bytes bytes secs. 10^6bits/sec
87380 16384 16384 20.00 1204.61
To restore the performance, we add software offload features
to the list of "always\_on" features for macvlan. This way
when a namespace or a guest using macvtap initially sends a
packet, this packet will not be segmented at macvlan level.
It will only be segmented when macvlan sends the packet
to the lower device.

net: sctp: fix sctp\_sf\_do\_5\_1D\_ce to verify if we/peer is AUTH capable
[ Upstream commit ec0223ec48a90cb605244b45f7c62de856403729 ]
RFC4895 introduced AUTH chunks for SCTP; during the SCTP
handshake RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO are negotiated (CHUNKS
being optional though):
---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
<------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
-------------------- COOKIE-ECHO -------------------->
<-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
A special case is when an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO
chunks to be authenticated:
---------- INIT[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------->
<------- INIT-ACK[RANDOM; CHUNKS; HMAC-ALGO] ---------
------------------ AUTH; COOKIE-ECHO ---------------->
<-------------------- COOKIE-ACK ---------------------
RFC4895, section 6.3. Receiving Authenticated Chunks says:
The receiver MUST use the HMAC algorithm indicated in
the HMAC Identifier field. If this algorithm was not
specified by the receiver in the HMAC-ALGO parameter in
the INIT or INIT-ACK chunk during association setup, the
AUTH chunk and all the chunks after it MUST be discarded
and an ERROR chunk SHOULD be sent with the error cause
defined in Section 4.1. [...] If no endpoint pair shared
key has been configured for that Shared Key Identifier,
all authenticated chunks MUST be silently discarded. [...]
When an endpoint requires COOKIE-ECHO chunks to be
authenticated, some special procedures have to be followed
because the reception of a COOKIE-ECHO chunk might result
in the creation of an SCTP association. If a packet arrives
containing an AUTH chunk as a first chunk, a COOKIE-ECHO
chunk as the second chunk, and possibly more chunks after
them, and the receiver does not have an STCB for that
packet, then authentication is based on the contents of
the COOKIE-ECHO chunk. In this situation, the receiver MUST
authenticate the chunks in the packet by using the RANDOM
parameters, CHUNKS parameters and HMAC\_ALGO parameters
obtained from the COOKIE-ECHO chunk, and possibly a local
shared secret as inputs to the authentication procedure
specified in Section 6.3. If authentication fails, then
the packet is discarded. If the authentication is successful,
the COOKIE-ECHO and all the chunks after the COOKIE-ECHO
MUST be processed. If the receiver has an STCB, it MUST
process the AUTH chunk as described above using the STCB
from the existing association to authenticate the
COOKIE-ECHO chunk and all the chunks after it. [...]
Commit bbd0d59809f9 introduced the possibility to receive
and verification of AUTH chunk, including the edge case for
authenticated COOKIE-ECHO. On reception of COOKIE-ECHO,
the function sctp\_sf\_do\_5\_1D\_ce() handles processing,
unpacks and creates a new association if it passed sanity
checks and also tests for authentication chunks being
present. After a new association has been processed, it
invokes sctp\_process\_init() on the new association and
walks through the parameter list it received from the INIT
chunk. It checks SCTP\_PARAM\_RANDOM, SCTP\_PARAM\_HMAC\_ALGO
and SCTP\_PARAM\_CHUNKS, and copies them into asoc->peer
meta data (peer\_random, peer\_hmacs, peer\_chunks) in case
sysctl -w net.sctp.auth\_enable=1 is set. If in INIT's
SCTP\_PARAM\_SUPPORTED\_EXT parameter SCTP\_CID\_AUTH is set,
peer\_random != NULL and peer\_hmacs != NULL the peer is to be
assumed asoc->peer.auth\_capable=1, in any other case
asoc->peer.auth\_capable=0.
Now, if in sctp\_sf\_do\_5\_1D\_ce() chunk->auth\_chunk is
available, we set up a fake auth chunk and pass that on to
sctp\_sf\_authenticate(), which at latest in
sctp\_auth\_calculate\_hmac() reliably dereferences a NULL pointer
at position 0..0008 when setting up the crypto key in
crypto\_hash\_setkey() by using asoc->asoc\_shared\_key that is
NULL as condition key\_id == asoc->active\_key\_id is true if
the AUTH chunk was injected correctly from remote. This
happens no matter what net.sctp.auth\_enable sysctl says.
The fix is to check for net->sctp.auth\_enable and for
asoc->peer.auth\_capable before doing any operations like
sctp\_sf\_authenticate() as no key is activated in
sctp\_auth\_asoc\_init\_active\_key() for each case.
Now as RFC4895 section 6.3 states that if the used HMAC-ALGO
passed from the INIT chunk was not used in the AUTH chunk, we
SHOULD send an error; however in this case it would be better
to just silently discard such a maliciously prepared handshake
as we didn't even receive a parameter at all. Also, as our
endpoint has no shared key configured, section 6.3 says that
MUST silently discard, which we are doing from now onwards.
Before calling sctp\_sf\_pdiscard(), we need not only to free
the association, but also the chunk->auth\_chunk skb, as
commit bbd0d59809f9 created a skb clone in that case.
I have tested this locally by using netfilter's nfqueue and
re-injecting packets into the local stack after maliciously
modifying the INIT chunk (removing RANDOM; HMAC-ALGO param)
and the SCTP packet containing the COOKIE\_ECHO (injecting
AUTH chunk before COOKIE\_ECHO). Fixed with this patch applied.

[ Upstream commit 8f355e5cee63c2c0c145d8206c4245d0189f47ff ]
If we receive a PTP event from the NIC when we haven't set up PTP state
in the driver, we attempt to read through a NULL pointer efx->ptp\_data,
triggering a panic.

ipv4: ipv6: better estimate tunnel header cut for correct ufo handling
[ Upstream commit 91a48a2e85a3b70ce10ead34b4ab5347f8d215c9 ]
Currently the UFO fragmentation process does not correctly handle inner
UDP frames.
(The following tcpdumps are captured on the parent interface with ufo
disabled while tunnel has ufo enabled, 2000 bytes payload, mtu 1280,
both sit device):
IPv6:
16:39:10.031613 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 3208, offset 0, flags [DF], proto IPv6 (41), length 1300)
192.168.122.151 > 1.1.1.1: IP6 (hlim 64, next-header Fragment (44) payload length: 1240) 2001::1 > 2001::8: frag (0x00000001:0|1232) 44883 > distinct: UDP, length 2000
16:39:10.031709 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 3209, offset 0, flags [DF], proto IPv6 (41), length 844)
192.168.122.151 > 1.1.1.1: IP6 (hlim 64, next-header Fragment (44) payload length: 784) 2001::1 > 2001::8: frag (0x00000001:0|776) 58979 > 46366: UDP, length 5471
We can see that fragmentation header offset is not correctly updated.
(fragmentation id handling is corrected by 916e4cf46d0204 ("ipv6: reuse
ip6\_frag\_id from ip6\_ufo\_append\_data")).
IPv4:
16:39:57.737761 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 3209, offset 0, flags [DF], proto IPIP (4), length 1296)
192.168.122.151 > 1.1.1.1: IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 57034, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 1276)
192.168.99.1.35961 > 192.168.99.2.distinct: UDP, length 2000
16:39:57.738028 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 3210, offset 0, flags [DF], proto IPIP (4), length 792)
192.168.122.151 > 1.1.1.1: IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 57035, offset 0, flags [none], proto UDP (17), length 772)
192.168.99.1.13531 > 192.168.99.2.20653: UDP, length 51109
In this case fragmentation id is incremented and offset is not updated.
First, I aligned inet\_gso\_segment and ipv6\_gso\_segment:
\* align naming of flags
\* ipv6\_gso\_segment: setting skb->encapsulation is unnecessary, as we
always ensure that the state of this flag is left untouched when
returning from upper gso segmenation function
\* ipv6\_gso\_segment: move skb\_reset\_inner\_headers below updating the
fragmentation header data, we don't care for updating fragmentation
header data
\* remove currently unneeded comment indicating skb->encapsulation might
get changed by upper gso\_segment callback (gre and udp-tunnel reset
encapsulation after segmentation on each fragment)
If we encounter an IPIP or SIT gso skb we now check for the protocol ==
IPPROTO\_UDP and that we at least have already traversed another ip(6)
protocol header.
The reason why we have to special case GSO\_IPIP and GSO\_SIT is that
we reset skb->encapsulation to 0 while skb\_mac\_gso\_segment the inner
protocol of GSO\_UDP\_TUNNEL or GSO\_GRE packets.

ipv6: reuse ip6\_frag\_id from ip6\_ufo\_append\_data
[ Upstream commit 916e4cf46d0204806c062c8c6c4d1f633852c5b6 ]
Currently we generate a new fragmentation id on UFO segmentation. It
is pretty hairy to identify the correct net namespace and dst there.
Especially tunnels use IFF\_XMIT\_DST\_RELEASE and thus have no skb\_dst
available at all.
This causes unreliable or very predictable ipv6 fragmentation id
generation while segmentation.
Luckily we already have pregenerated the ip6\_frag\_id in
ip6\_ufo\_append\_data and can use it here.

This patch fixes two bugs in fastopen :
1) The tcp\_sendmsg(..., @size) argument was ignored.
Code was relying on user not fooling the kernel with iovec mismatches
2) When MTU is about 64KB, tcp\_send\_syn\_data() attempts order-5
allocations, which are likely to fail when memory gets fragmented.

tun: remove bogus hardware vlan acceleration flags from vlan\_features
[ Upstream commit 6671b2240c54585d4afb5286a29f1569fe5e40a8 ]
Even though only the outer vlan tag can be HW accelerated in the transmission
path, in the TUN/TAP driver vlan\_features mirrors hw\_features, which happens
to have the NETIF\_F\_HW\_VLAN\_?TAG\_TX flags set. Because of this, during packet
tranmisssion through a stacked vlan device dev\_hard\_start\_xmit, (incorrectly)
assuming that the vlan device supports hardware vlan acceleration, does not
add the vlan header to the skb payload and the inner vlan tags are lost
(vlan\_tci contains the outer vlan tag when userspace reads the packet from
the tap device).

veth: Fix vlan\_features so as to be able to use stacked vlan interfaces
[ Upstream commit 8d0d21f4053c07714802cbe8b1fe26913ec296cc ]
Even if we create a stacked vlan interface such as veth0.10.20, it sends
single tagged frames (tagged with only vid 10).
Because vlan\_features of a veth interface has the
NETIF\_F\_HW\_VLAN\_[CTAG/STAG]\_TX bits, veth0.10 also has that feature, so
dev\_hard\_start\_xmit(veth0.10) doesn't call \_\_vlan\_put\_tag() and
vlan\_dev\_hard\_start\_xmit(veth0.10) overwrites vlan\_tci.
This prevents us from using a combination of 802.1ad and 802.1Q
in containers, etc.

rapidio/tsi721: fix tasklet termination in dma channel release
commit 04379dffdd4da820d51a1566ad2e86f3b1ad97ed upstream.
This patch is a modification of the patch originally proposed by
Xiaotian Feng : https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/11/5/413
This new version disables DMA channel interrupts and ensures that the
tasklet wil not be scheduled again before calling tasklet\_kill().
Unfortunately the updated patch was not released at that time due to
planned rework of Tsi721 mport driver to use threaded interrupts (which
has yet to happen). Recently the issue was reported again:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/2/19/762.
Description from the original Xiaotian's patch:
"Some drivers use tasklet\_disable in device remove/release process,
tasklet\_disable will inc tasklet->count and return. If the tasklet is
not handled yet under some softirq pressure, the tasklet will be
placed on the tasklet\_vec, never have a chance to be excuted. This
might lead to a heavy loaded ksoftirqd, wakeup with pending\_softirq,
but tasklet is disabled. tasklet\_kill should be used in this case."
This patch is applicable to kernel versions starting from v3.5.

sched: Fix double normalization of vruntime
commit 791c9e0292671a3bfa95286bb5c08129d8605618 upstream.
dequeue\_entity() is called when p->on\_rq and sets se->on\_rq = 0
which appears to guarentee that the !se->on\_rq condition is met.
If the task has done set\_current\_state(TASK\_INTERRUPTIBLE) without
schedule() the second condition will be met and vruntime will be
incorrectly adjusted twice.
In certain cases this can result in the task's vruntime never increasing
past the vruntime of other tasks on the CFS' run queue, starving them of
CPU time.
This patch changes switched\_from\_fair() to use !p->on\_rq instead of
!se->on\_rq.
I'm able to cause a task with a priority of 120 to starve all other
tasks with the same priority on an ARM platform running 3.2.51-rt72
PREEMPT RT by writing one character at time to a serial tty (16550 UART)
in a tight loop. I'm also able to verify making this change corrects the
problem on that platform and kernel version.

Commit 0eef615665ed ("memcg: fix css reference leak and endless loop in

d8ad30559715 ("mm/memcg: iteration skip memcgs not yet fully

It's elusive, and harder to get than the original, but for a couple of
days before rc1, I several times saw a endless loop similar to that
supposedly being fixed.
This time it was a tighter loop in \_\_mem\_cgroup\_iter\_next(): because we
can get here when our root has already been offlined, and the ordering
of conditions was such that we then just cycled around forever.

ocfs2: fix quota file corruption
commit 15c34a760630ca2c803848fba90ca0646a9907dd upstream.
Global quota files are accessed from different nodes. Thus we cannot
cache offset of quota structure in the quota file after we drop our node
reference count to it because after that moment quota structure may be
freed and reallocated elsewhere by a different node resulting in
corruption of quota file.
Fix the problem by clearing dq\_off when we are releasing dquot structure.
We also remove the DB\_READ\_B handling because it is useless -
DQ\_ACTIVE\_B is set iff DQ\_READ\_B is set.

---[ end trace a0088dcf07ae10f2 ]---
because munlock\_vma\_pages\_range() thinks it's unexpectedly in the middle
of a THP page. This can be reproduced with default config since 3.11
kernels. A reproducer can be found in the kernel's selftest directory
for networking by running ./psock\_tpacket.
The problem is that an order=2 compound page (allocated by
alloc\_one\_pg\_vec\_page() is part of the munlocked VM\_MIXEDMAP vma (mapped
by packet\_mmap()) and mistaken for a THP page and assumed to be order=9.
The checks for THP in munlock came with commit ff6a6da60b89 ("mm:
accelerate munlock() treatment of THP pages"), i.e. since 3.9, but did
not trigger a bug. It just makes munlock\_vma\_pages\_range() skip such
compound pages until the next 512-pages-aligned page, when it encounters
a head page. This is however not a problem for vma's where mlocking has
no effect anyway, but it can distort the accounting.
Since commit 7225522bb429 ("mm: munlock: batch non-THP page isolation
and munlock+putback using pagevec") this can trigger a VM\_BUG\_ON in
PageTransHuge() check.
This patch fixes the issue by adding VM\_MIXEDMAP flag to VM\_SPECIAL, a
list of flags that make vma's non-mlockable and non-mergeable. The
reasoning is that VM\_MIXEDMAP vma's are similar to VM\_PFNMAP, which is
already on the VM\_SPECIAL list, and both are intended for non-LRU pages
where mlocking makes no sense anyway. Related Lkml discussion can be
found in [2].

mm: page\_alloc: exempt GFP\_THISNODE allocations from zone fairness
commit 27329369c9ecf37771b2a65202cbf5578cff3331 upstream.
Jan Stancek reports manual page migration encountering allocation
failures after some pages when there is still plenty of memory free, and
bisected the problem down to commit 81c0a2bb515f ("mm: page\_alloc: fair
zone allocator policy").
The problem is that GFP\_THISNODE obeys the zone fairness allocation
batches on one hand, but doesn't reset them and wake kswapd on the other
hand. After a few of those allocations, the batches are exhausted and
the allocations fail.
Fixing this means either having GFP\_THISNODE wake up kswapd, or
GFP\_THISNODE not participating in zone fairness at all. The latter
seems safer as an acute bugfix, we can clean up later.

An update that solves 11 vulnerabilities and has 64 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 kernel has been updated to fix
various bugs and security issues.
The following security bugs have been fixed:
\*
CVE-2014-1739: The media\_device\_enum\_entities function in
drivers/media/media-device.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14.6 does not
initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging
/dev/media0 read access for a MEDIA\_IOC\_ENUM\_ENTITIES ioctl call
(bnc#882804).
\*
CVE-2014-4171: mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does
not properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole
punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i\_mutex
hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by
interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an
MADV\_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC\_FL\_PUNCH\_HOLE fallocate call
(bnc#883518).
\*
CVE-2014-4508: arch/x86/kernel/entry\_32.S in the Linux kernel
through 3.15.1 on 32-bit x86 platforms, when syscall auditing is enabled
and the sep CPU feature flag is set, allows local users to cause a denial
of service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as
demonstrated by number 1000 (bnc#883724).
\*
CVE-2014-4667: The sctp\_association\_free function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not properly
manage a certain backlog value, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet (bnc#885422).
\*
CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.15.6 allows local users to gain privileges by
leveraging data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and an inet
socket (bnc#887082).
\*
CVE-2014-5077: The sctp\_assoc\_update function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.8, when SCTP
authentication is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by starting to establish an
association between two endpoints immediately after an exchange of INIT
and INIT ACK chunks to establish an earlier association between these
endpoints in the opposite direction (bnc#889173).
\*
CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the
parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a crafted iso9660
image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry that has a CL entry.
(bnc#892490)
\*
CVE-2014-5472: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a crafted iso9660
image with a self-referential CL entry. (bnc#892490)
\*
CVE-2014-2706: Race condition in the mac80211 subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 3.13.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(system crash) via network traffic that improperly interacts with the
WLAN\_STA\_PS\_STA state (aka power-save mode), related to sta\_info.c and
tx.c. (bnc#871797)
\*
CVE-2014-4027: The rd\_build\_device\_space function in
drivers/target/target\_core\_rd.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14 does not
properly initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information from ramdisk\_mcp memory by leveraging access
to a SCSI initiator. (bnc#882639)
\*
CVE-2014-3153 The futex\_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not ensure that calls have two different
futex addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted
FUTEX\_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification.

The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 kernel was updated to fix
various bugs and security issues.
Following security bugs were fixed: CVE-2013-1979: The scm\_set\_cred
function in include/net/scm.h in the Linux kernel before 3.8.11 uses
incorrect uid and gid values during credentials passing, which allows
local users to gain privileges via a crafted application (bnc#816708).
CVE-2014-1739: The media\_device\_enum\_entities function in
drivers/media/media-device.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14.6 does not
initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging /dev/media0 read
access for a MEDIA\_IOC\_ENUM\_ENTITIES ioctl call (bnc#882804).
CVE-2014-4171: mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does not
properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole
punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i\_mutex
hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by
interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an
MADV\_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC\_FL\_PUNCH\_HOLE fallocate call
(bnc#883518).
CVE-2014-4508: arch/x86/kernel/entry\_32.S in the Linux kernel through
3.15.1 on 32-bit x86 platforms, when syscall auditing is enabled and the
sep CPU feature flag is set, allows local users to cause a denial of
service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as
demonstrated by number 1000 (bnc#883724).
CVE-2014-4667: The sctp\_association\_free function in net/sctp/associola.c
in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not properly manage a certain
backlog value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet (bnc#885422).
CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.15.6 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging
data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and an inet socket
(bnc#887082).
CVE-2014-5077: The sctp\_assoc\_update function in net/sctp/associola.c in
the Linux kernel through 3.15.8, when SCTP authentication is enabled,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and OOPS) by starting to establish an association between two
endpoints immediately after an exchange of INIT and INIT ACK chunks to
establish an earlier association between these endpoints in the opposite
direction (bnc#889173).
CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the
parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a crafted iso9660
image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry that has a CL entry.
(bnc#892490)
CVE-2014-5472: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a crafted iso9660
image with a self-referential CL entry. (bnc#892490)
CVE-2014-2706: Race condition in the mac80211 subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 3.13.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(system crash) via network traffic that improperly interacts with the
WLAN\_STA\_PS\_STA state (aka power-save mode), related to sta\_info.c and
tx.c. (bnc#871797)
CVE-2014-4027: The rd\_build\_device\_space function in
drivers/target/target\_core\_rd.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14 does not
properly initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information from ramdisk\_mcp memory by leveraging access
to a SCSI initiator. (bnc#882639)

# Android Security Bulletin—April 2017

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published April 03, 2017 | Updated August 17, 2017*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Alongside the bulletin, we have released a security
update to Nexus devices through an over-the-air (OTA) update. The Google device
firmware images have also been released to the [Google Developer
site](https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images). Security patch levels of April 05, 2017 or later address all of these
issues. Refer to the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices) to learn how to check a device's security patch
level.

Partners were notified of the issues described in the bulletin on March 06, 2017
or earlier. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the Android
Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin. This bulletin
also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a Critical security vulnerability that could
enable remote code execution on an affected device through multiple methods such
as email, web browsing, and MMS when processing media files. The
[severity
assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would
possibly have on an affected device, assuming the platform and service
mitigations are disabled for development purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the [Android and Google service
mitigations](#mitigations) section for details on the [Android
security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as [SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html),
which improve the security of the Android platform.

We encourage all customers to accept these updates to their devices.

## Announcements

* This bulletin has two security patch level strings to provide Android
  partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities
  that are similar across all Android devices. See [Common questions and answers](#common-questions-and-answers) for
  additional information:
  + **2017-04-01**: Partial security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
  + **2017-04-05**: Complete security patch level string. This
    security patch level string indicates that all issues associated with 2017-04-01
    and 2017-04-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed.
* Supported Google devices will receive a single OTA update with the April 05,
  2017 security patch level.

## Android and Google Service Mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the [Android
security platform](/docs/security/enhancements) and service protections such as SafetyNet. These
capabilities reduce the likelihood that security vulnerabilities could be
successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android Security team actively monitors for abuse with [Verify
  Apps and SafetyNet](/static/docs/security/overview/reports/Google_Android_Security_2016_Report_Final.pdf), which are designed to warn users about [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/source.android.com/en//security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Verify Apps is enabled by default on devices with [Google Mobile Services](http://www.android.com/gms) and is especially
  important for users who install applications from outside of Google Play. Device
  rooting tools are prohibited within Google Play, but Verify Apps warns users
  when they attempt to install a detected rooting application—no matter where it
  comes from. Additionally, Verify Apps attempts to identify and block
  installation of known malicious applications that exploit a privilege escalation
  vulnerability. If such an application has already been installed, Verify Apps
  will notify the user and attempt to remove the detected application.
* As appropriate, Google Hangouts and Messenger applications do not
  automatically pass media to processes such as Mediaserver.

## Common Questions and Answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, read the instructions on
the [Pixel
and Nexus update schedule](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2017-04-01 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2017-04-05 or later address all issues associated
  with the 2017-04-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-01]
* [ro.build.version.security\_patch]:[2017-04-05]

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the April 01, 2017 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of April 05, 2017 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. How do I determine which Google devices are affected by each
issue?**

In the [2017-04-01](#2017-04-01-details) and
[2017-04-05](#2017-04-05-details)
security vulnerability details sections, each table has an *Updated Google
devices* column that covers the range of affected Google devices updated for
each issue. This column has a few options:

* **All Google devices**: If an issue affects All and Pixel
  devices, the table will have "All" in the *Updated Google devices*
  column. "All" encapsulates the following [supported
  devices](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices): Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 9, Android One,
  Nexus Player, Pixel C, Pixel, and Pixel XL.
* **Some Google devices**: If an issue doesn't affect all Google
  devices, the affected Google devices are listed in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.
* **No Google devices**: If no Google devices running Android 7.0
  are affected by the issue, the table will have "None" in the *Updated Google
  devices* column.

**4. What do the entries in the references column map to?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs. These prefixes map as follows:

| Prefix | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

Crashes observed only when Atheros 9380 based miniPCIe card is used (with ath9k driver). They mostly associated with heavy wireless bandwidth use, especially when torrent client with lots of connections runs over wifi. Distro in use is ArchLinux i686. Crashes has been observed on the 3.12.x kernels, as well as on the 3.10.29 LTS kernel. It seems that I can observe this crashes only on the kernels buit by myself, not on the stock ARCH kernels. I can provide crash tool outputs (bt log ps concatenated into single file) for the several crash instances. I will also attach config file, which was used to build affected kernels. GCC 4.8.2 has been used. Please, let me know what useful extra information I can provide. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=70551#c1)  Max Sydorenko    2014-02-14 03:18:34 UTC  ``` A correction here: now I also have got a crash on 3.10.29 LTS kernel with stock Archlinux config, it wasn't exactly one from repository though (I needed to rebuild it to include debug info). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=70551#c2)  Stanislaw Gruszka    2014-02-14 16:33:21 UTC  ``` What shows "gdb l *(ath_tx_aggr_sleep+0x62)" command called from crash tool? ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=70551#c3)  Max Sydorenko    2014-02-14 17:23:42 UTC  ``` crash> gdb l *(ath_tx_aggr_sleep+0x62) No symbol "ath_tx_aggr_sleep" in current context. gdb: gdb request failed: l *(ath_tx_aggr_sleep+0x62)  Sorry, may be I am doing something wrong? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=70551#c4)  Stanislaw Gruszka    2014-02-14 17:34:54 UTC  ``` Try to load module first i.e. "mod -s ath9k".

I can see only one place when that can happen, it's on ieee80211_tx_h_unicast_ps_buf() function. You can verify that by checking where the *(invoke_tx_handlers+0x1322) address is.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1083512#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2014-04-02 11:29:09 UTC  ``` A Linux kernel built with a Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (CONFIG_MAC80211) is vulnerable to a crash caused by a race condition in frame transmission path and station wakeup event, in case when it's sleeping. The crash occurs because, mac80211 stack buffers frames when the station is sleeping, and the same are transmitted upon the station's(STA) wakeup. At this point, a buffered TX frame list is being emptied, while a new frame is being added to the RX list.  A remote unprivileged user/program could use this flaw to crash the system kernel, resulting in DoS.

mac80211: fix AP powersave TX vs. wakeup raceThere is a race between the TX path and the STA wakeup: while
a station is sleeping, mac80211 buffers frames until it wakes
up, then the frames are transmitted. However, the RX and TX
path are concurrent, so the packet indicating wakeup can be
processed while a packet is being transmitted.
This can lead to a situation where the buffered frames list
is emptied on the one side, while a frame is being added on
the other side, as the station is still seen as sleeping in
the TX path.
As a result, the newly added frame will not be send anytime
soon. It might be sent much later (and out of order) when the
station goes to sleep and wakes up the next time.
Additionally, it can lead to the crash below.
Fix all this by synchronising both paths with a new lock.
Both path are not fastpath since they handle PS situations.
In a later patch we'll remove the extra skb queue locks to
reduce locking overhead.

mac80211: fix AP powersave TX vs. wakeup race

```
There is a race between the TX path and the STA wakeup: while
a station is sleeping, mac80211 buffers frames until it wakes
up, then the frames are transmitted. However, the RX and TX
path are concurrent, so the packet indicating wakeup can be
processed while a packet is being transmitted.

This can lead to a situation where the buffered frames list
is emptied on the one side, while a frame is being added on
the other side, as the station is still seen as sleeping in
the TX path.

As a result, the newly added frame will not be send anytime
soon. It might be sent much later (and out of order) when the
station goes to sleep and wakes up the next time.

Additionally, it can lead to the crash below.

Fix all this by synchronising both paths with a new lock.
Both path are not fastpath since they handle PS situations.

In a later patch we'll remove the extra skb queue locks to
reduce locking overhead.

# CVE-2014-3144

* [ULN](https://linux.oracle.com) >
* [Oracle Linux CVE repository](https://linux.oracle.com/cve)  >
* CVE-2014-3144

## CVE Details

| **Release Date:** | 2014-04-13 |
| --- | --- |

## Description

The (1) BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR and (2) BPF\_S\_ANC\_NLATTR\_NEST extension implementations in the sk\_run\_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 do not check whether a certain length value is sufficiently large, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer underflow and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr and \_\_skb\_get\_nlattr\_nest functions before the vulnerability was announced.

See more information about CVE-2014-3144 from [MITRE CVE dictionary](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3144) and [NIST NVD](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-3144)

An update that solves 13 vulnerabilities and has 75 fixes
is now available. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 kernel has been updated to fix
various bugs and security issues.
The following security bugs have been fixed:
\*
CVE-2014-1739: The media\_device\_enum\_entities function in
drivers/media/media-device.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14.6 does not
initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging
/dev/media0 read access for a MEDIA\_IOC\_ENUM\_ENTITIES ioctl call
(bnc#882804).
\*
CVE-2014-4171: mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does
not properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole
punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i\_mutex
hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by
interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an
MADV\_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC\_FL\_PUNCH\_HOLE fallocate call
(bnc#883518).
\*
CVE-2014-4508: arch/x86/kernel/entry\_32.S in the Linux kernel
through 3.15.1 on 32-bit x86 platforms, when syscall auditing is enabled
and the sep CPU feature flag is set, allows local users to cause a denial
of service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as
demonstrated by number 1000 (bnc#883724).
\*
CVE-2014-4667: The sctp\_association\_free function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not properly
manage a certain backlog value, which allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet (bnc#885422).
\*
CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.15.6 allows local users to gain privileges by
leveraging data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and an inet
socket (bnc#887082).
\*
CVE-2014-5077: The sctp\_assoc\_update function in
net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.8, when SCTP
authentication is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by starting to establish an
association between two endpoints immediately after an exchange of INIT
and INIT ACK chunks to establish an earlier association between these
endpoints in the opposite direction (bnc#889173).
\*
CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the
parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a crafted iso9660
image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry that has a CL entry.
(bnc#892490)
\*
CVE-2014-5472: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a crafted iso9660
image with a self-referential CL entry. (bnc#892490)
\*
CVE-2014-2706: Race condition in the mac80211 subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 3.13.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(system crash) via network traffic that improperly interacts with the
WLAN\_STA\_PS\_STA state (aka power-save mode), related to sta\_info.c and
tx.c. (bnc#871797)
\*
CVE-2014-4027: The rd\_build\_device\_space function in
drivers/target/target\_core\_rd.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14 does not
properly initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information from ramdisk\_mcp memory by leveraging access
to a SCSI initiator. (bnc#882639)
\*
CVE-2014-3153 The futex\_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the
Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not ensure that calls have two different
futex addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted
FUTEX\_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification.
(bnc#880892)
\*
CVE-2014-6410: Avoid infinite loop when processing indirect ICBs
(bnc#896689)

The SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 3 RealTime Extension kernel was
updated to fix various bugs and security issues.
Following security bugs were fixed: CVE-2013-1979: The scm\_set\_cred
function in include/net/scm.h in the Linux kernel before 3.8.11 uses
incorrect uid and gid values during credentials passing, which allows
local users to gain privileges via a crafted application (bnc#816708).
CVE-2014-1739: The media\_device\_enum\_entities function in
drivers/media/media-device.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14.6 does not
initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to obtain
sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging /dev/media0 read
access for a MEDIA\_IOC\_ENUM\_ENTITIES ioctl call (bnc#882804).
CVE-2014-4171: mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does not
properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole
punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i\_mutex
hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by
interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an
MADV\_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC\_FL\_PUNCH\_HOLE fallocate call
(bnc#883518).
CVE-2014-4508: arch/x86/kernel/entry\_32.S in the Linux kernel through
3.15.1 on 32-bit x86 platforms, when syscall auditing is enabled and the
sep CPU feature flag is set, allows local users to cause a denial of
service (OOPS and system crash) via an invalid syscall number, as
demonstrated by number 1000 (bnc#883724).
CVE-2014-4667: The sctp\_association\_free function in net/sctp/associola.c
in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not properly manage a certain
backlog value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet (bnc#885422).
CVE-2014-4943: The PPPoL2TP feature in net/l2tp/l2tp\_ppp.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.15.6 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging
data-structure differences between an l2tp socket and an inet socket
(bnc#887082).
CVE-2014-5077: The sctp\_assoc\_update function in net/sctp/associola.c in
the Linux kernel through 3.15.8, when SCTP authentication is enabled,
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
dereference and OOPS) by starting to establish an association between two
endpoints immediately after an exchange of INIT and INIT ACK chunks to
establish an earlier association between these endpoints in the opposite
direction (bnc#889173).
CVE-2014-5471: Stack consumption vulnerability in the
parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service
(uncontrolled recursion, and system crash or reboot) via a crafted iso9660
image with a CL entry referring to a directory entry that has a CL entry.
(bnc#892490)
CVE-2014-5472: The parse\_rock\_ridge\_inode\_internal function in
fs/isofs/rock.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 allows local users to
cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process) via a crafted iso9660
image with a self-referential CL entry. (bnc#892490)
CVE-2014-2706: Race condition in the mac80211 subsystem in the Linux
kernel before 3.13.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
(system crash) via network traffic that improperly interacts with the
WLAN\_STA\_PS\_STA state (aka power-save mode), related to sta\_info.c and
tx.c. (bnc#871797)
CVE-2014-4027: The rd\_build\_device\_space function in
drivers/target/target\_core\_rd.c in the Linux kernel before 3.14 does not
properly initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to
obtain sensitive information from ramdisk\_mcp memory by leveraging access
to a SCSI initiator. (bnc#882639)
CVE-2014-3153 The futex\_requeue function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux
kernel through 3.14.5 does not ensure that calls have two different futex
addresses, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted
FUTEX\_REQUEUE command that facilitates unsafe waiter modification.
