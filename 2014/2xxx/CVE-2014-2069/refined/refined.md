Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 'eshtery CMS' application has a vulnerability in its `FileManager.aspx` component that allows for arbitrary file reading.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** The `FileManager.aspx` file does not properly sanitize or validate the `file` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, source code, or any other file the web server has access to.
- **Potential for further compromise:** In the provided example, the attacker was able to read the `admin.asp` file which contained the administrator password, thereby allowing them to take control of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `FileManager.aspx` file with a manipulated `file` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `FileManager.aspx` file and the vulnerable `file` parameter.

**Technical details:**
The vulnerable URL format is:
`http://server/[path]/FileManager.aspx?file=<arbitrary_file_path>`

The provided example included the following URLs:
- `http://server/[path]/FileManager.aspx?file=E:\web\admin.asp`
- `http://eshtery.she7ata.com/projects/eshtery//FileManager.aspx?file=E:\web\she7atac\admin.asp`

These URLs demonstrate the ability to read the `admin.asp` file by providing its full server path as the value to the `file` parameter.
