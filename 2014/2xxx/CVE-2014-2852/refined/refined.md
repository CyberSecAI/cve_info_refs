- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in OpenAFS. An attacker able to connect to an OpenAFS fileserver can trigger this overflow.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability. A secondary denial of service vulnerability exists where the server listener thread hangs for about one second when it receives an invalid packet which allows an attacker to slow down the server by sending such packets.

- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability can crash the fileserver and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution. Repeated exploitation of the secondary vulnerability could slow down the server to an unusable state.

- **Attack vectors**: Network connection to an OpenAFS fileserver is required.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the capability to connect to the OpenAFS fileserver.
