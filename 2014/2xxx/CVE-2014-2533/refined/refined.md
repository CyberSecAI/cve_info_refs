  "cve": "CVE-2014-2533",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The `ifwatchd` executable, which runs with root privileges, allows users to specify scripts to execute using the `-A` command-line argument. However, it does not drop privileges when executing these user-supplied scripts.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper privilege management",
        "Unsanitized user-supplied input leading to command execution as root"
      ],
      "impact": "Local privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local execution of the `ifwatchd` binary with a crafted `-A` argument that points to a malicious script.",
      "required_capabilities": "Local access to a vulnerable QNX system. The attacker must have the ability to execute programs, create files and modify their permissions."
    }
  ],
  "details": "The vulnerability is present in the `ifwatchd` daemon on QNX systems. The `ifwatchd` binary is setuid root and is responsible for monitoring network interfaces and executing scripts based on changes to the interfaces. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the program does not drop privileges when executing a user supplied script via the `-A` command line argument. This means that the user supplied script is executed with root privileges, leading to local privilege escalation.",
  "affected_products": [
    "QNX 6.4.x",
    "QNX 6.5.x"
  ]
