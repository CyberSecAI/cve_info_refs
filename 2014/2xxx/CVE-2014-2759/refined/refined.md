Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a memory corruption vulnerability within Internet Explorer. Specifically, it stems from how Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory. This improper access leads to memory corruption, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary vulnerability is memory corruption. This occurs when the browser mishandles how objects are stored and accessed in memory.
*   **Remote Code Execution:**  The memory corruption can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. By corrupting memory in a specific way, an attacker can force the browser to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker gains the same user rights as the current user. If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can take complete control of the affected system.
*   **System Compromise:** Complete system control could lead to the installation of malware, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new accounts with full rights.
*   **Data Theft:**  An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information due to the ability to execute code and gain access to system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web-Based Attack:**
    *   Attackers can host a specially crafted website designed to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content can be used to deliver exploit code.
    *   Attackers must convince users to visit the malicious website, often via social engineering tactics like email or instant messaging with malicious links or attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Malicious Content:** Attackers need to host or inject malicious web content into accessible websites.
*   **Social Engineering:** They must lure users into visiting the malicious site.
*   **Technical Expertise:** Attackers need the know-how to craft web content that can trigger the vulnerability and inject malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

*   This CVE is part of a larger patch that addresses several memory corruption and elevation of privilege issues in Internet Explorer.
*   The update is rated as "Critical" for Windows clients and "Important" for Windows servers, indicating the severity of the vulnerability.
*   The provided document lists several other CVEs resolved in the same patch, many of them also related to memory corruption, indicating a broad pattern of this issue within Internet Explorer at the time.

This analysis provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its impact, attack vectors, and required attacker capabilities, offering a comprehensive understanding of CVE-2014-2759.
