Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2830:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow in the `cifskey.c` file or `cifscreds.c` (depending on the version of cifs-utils). The overflow occurs due to the usage of `sprintf` without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow in `cifskey.c` (or `cifscreds.c`).
- Unsafe use of `sprintf` function which is prone to buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The Gentoo Security Advisory states that a remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability to cause an "unspecified impact". This means that the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code, crash the system, or cause other denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the `pam_cifscreds` module. This module is typically used to authenticate users to CIFS shares (SMB shares) which are network resources.
- An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability via remote network login/authentication processes using crafted or oversized credentials provided to `pam_cifscreds`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker, with the ability to trigger authentication to a system with the vulnerable `pam_cifscreds` module configured.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sebastian Krahmer.
- The fix involves patching the `cifskey.c` file to prevent the buffer overflow, with a patch available on Novell Bugzilla.
- The vulnerable code is used by the `pam_cifscreds` module.
- Gentoo's advisory notes that PAM support for LinuxCIFS utils is disabled by default unless a specific use flag is enabled.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
- The core issue is the usage of `sprintf` to format a string into a stack buffer without checking the length of the input, leading to a classic stack overflow vulnerability. By supplying a long enough username, password, or other credential data, an attacker can overwrite data on the stack which can lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker is careful about the overwritten data and return addresses.
