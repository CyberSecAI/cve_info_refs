| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1086224#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-04-10 12:04:56 UTC  ``` Sebastian Krahmer discovered a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in cifskey.c, which is used by pam_cifscreds.  A patch is available from the following: <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=870168>  References: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q2/66>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1086224#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-04-10 12:06:09 UTC  ```  Created cifs-utils tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1086226](show_bug.cgi?id=1086226 "CLOSED ERRATA - cifs-utils: stack-based buffer overflow flaw in pam_cifscreds [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1086224#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-04-11 10:28:02 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-2830](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2830) to this issue:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q2/96>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1086224#c7)  Jeff Layton    2014-04-16 12:58:14 UTC  ``` Ok, I merged Sebastian's patch (with a small modification).  I've proposed a couple of other patches to help fix up the error handling, including the case where the buffer would have been overrun. Assuming no one objects, I'll merge them in the next few days and we can get this package built for f20:  <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cifs/9564> <http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.cifs/9563>   ``` |  |

Use CVE-2014-2830 for any product that is exploitable because of
the use of sprintf as shown in:

  <http://bugzillafiles.novell.org/attachment.cgi?id=585460>

Apparently one exploitable case is the pam_cifscreds product. We do not
know whether there is an exploitable case in the cifs-utils package
because of the:

  <https://git.samba.org/?p=cifs-utils.git;a=blob;f=cifskey.c>

code. There might be other products using an essentially identical
cifskey.c file.

# LinuxCIFS utils: Buffer overflow — GLSA **201612-08**

A vulnerability in LinuxCIFS utils' "cifscreds" PAM module might
allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-fs/cifs-utils** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.4** |

### Background

The LinuxCIFS utils are a collection of tools for managing Linux CIFS
Client Filesystems.

### Description

A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in cifskey.c or cifscreds.c
in LinuxCIFS, as used in “pam\_cifscreds.”

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause an
unspecified impact.

### Workaround

Don’t use LinuxCIFS utils’ “cifscreds” PAM module. In Gentoo,
LinuxCIFS utils’ PAM support is disabled by default unless the
“pam” USE flag is enabled.

### Resolution

All LinuxCIFS utils users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-fs/cifs-utils-6.4"

```
