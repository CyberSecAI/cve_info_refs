**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer's failure to properly validate permissions during local file installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper permission validation in Internet Explorer.
- Information disclosure vulnerability, not a remote code execution vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could read the content of local files on the user's system.
- The vulnerability can be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution vulnerability) to take advantage of elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack: An attacker could host a malicious website or inject malicious content into compromised websites, enticing users to visit the site and trigger the vulnerability. The attacker would have to convince users to take action, such as clicking a link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system prior to exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is classified as an "Elevation of Privilege" (EoP) vulnerability, even though the immediate impact is information disclosure. This is because it could be chained with other vulnerabilities to elevate privileges.
- The vulnerability affects Internet Explorer 8, 9, 10 and 11.
- The provided Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-035 also addresses numerous other vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, including many remote code execution vulnerabilities.
- This vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security bulletin.
- Microsoft had no reports of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild before the release of this security bulletin.
