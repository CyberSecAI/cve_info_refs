01. ### Advisory Information ###

```
Title: Multiple Reflected XSS vulnerabilities in Oliver (formerly
Webshare) v1.3.1
```

Date published: 2016-15-04
Date of last update: 2014-03-04
Vendors contacted: Oliver (formerly Webshare) v1.3.1
Discovered by: Rv3Laboratory [Research Team]
Severity: Medium

02. ### Vulnerability Information ###

CVE reference: CVE-2014-2710
VU#279207
OVI-2016-7982
CVSS v2 Base Score: 4.3
CVSS v2 Vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N)
Component/s: Oliver (formerly Webshare) v1.3.1
Class: Input Validation Error

03. ### Introduction ###

Oliver is a PHP-based front-end to FTP, released under the GPL.

<http://oliver.sourceforge.net/>
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/oliver/>

04. ### Vulnerability Description ###

Multiple Non-Persistent Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities have been
identified in the Oliver (formerly Webshare) web application.
Oliver contains a flaw that allows multiple reflected cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks.
This flaw exists because certain pages do not validate input before
returning it to users.

Vulnerable file(s):
index.php (login page)
loginform-inc.php (login form)

Request Method(s):
GET

05. ### Technical Description / Proof of Concept Code ###

The vulnerability is located in the pages

<http://localhost/oliver/index.php>
<http://localhost/oliver/loginform-inc.php>

The application does not validate correctly the URL upon submission.
The attacker can inject the malicious javascript code:

<isindex x="javascript:" onmouseover="alert('Rv3Lab XSS')">

```
<http://localhost/oliver/index.php/><isindex x="javascript:"
onmouseover="alert('Rv3Lab XSS')">
<http://localhost/oliver/loginform-inc.php/><isindex x="javascript:"
onmouseover="alert('Rv3Lab XSS')">
```

06. ### Business Impact ###

This may allow an attacker to create a specially crafted URL that
would execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser within the trust
relationship between their browser and the server.

07. ### Systems Affected ###

```
This vulnerability was tested against: Oliver (formerly Webshare) v1.3.0
and v1.3.1
```

Older versions are probably affected too, but they were not checked.

08. ### Vendor Information, Solutions and Workarounds ###

Currently, there are no known upgrades or patches to correct this
vulnerability.
Oliver (formerly Webshare) No longer supported
