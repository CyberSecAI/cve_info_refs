Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2907:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, a malformed RTP packet can cause the dissector to crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The RTP dissector has a flaw in handling malformed packets. This suggests a lack of proper input validation or error handling in the dissector's code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a crash of the Wireshark application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network injection:** An attacker can inject a specially crafted, malformed RTP packet onto the network.
- **Malicious packet trace:** An attacker can create a malicious packet trace file containing the malformed RTP packet and convince a user to open it with Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs the ability to inject packets onto the network that the victim is monitoring.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious packet trace file if not directly injecting network packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes a sample pcap file ("fuzz-2014-03-14-15333_sip2rtp1.pcap") that can trigger the crash, indicating that the vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.10.0 to 1.10.6.
- The issue is fixed in Wireshark version 1.10.7.
- The openSUSE update indicates that the vulnerability can be referenced as bnc#874760 in the Novell bug tracker.
