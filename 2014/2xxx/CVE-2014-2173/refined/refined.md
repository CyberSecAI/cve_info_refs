Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of authentication and authorization controls for the serial port in Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authentication/Authorization:** The system fails to properly authenticate and authorize access to the serial port, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privileged Access:** An attacker can connect to the serial port and gain privileged access to the affected system. This could lead to the ability to execute commands with root privileges, potentially leading to system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploited through local access to the physical serial port of the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the device's serial port to connect to it.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication to gain access through the serial port.

**Summary**

CVE-2014-2173 describes a vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence TC and TE Software that allows an unauthenticated local attacker to gain privileged access to the system via the serial port due to insufficient authentication and authorization controls.
