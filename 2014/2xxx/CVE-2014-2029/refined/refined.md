Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Percona Toolkit (PT) implements its `--version-check` feature. This feature, designed to warn users about known vulnerabilities in their local MySQL instance and check for PT updates, downloads its configuration from a remote server via plain HTTP. This configuration dictates what data PT collects, and it was not hardcoded into the scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Plain HTTP Communication:** The configuration for version checks is downloaded over an unencrypted HTTP connection (`http://v.percona.com/`). This allows for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
2.  **Remote Configuration Download:** The configuration is not hardcoded and is fetched from a remote server, making it vulnerable to tampering.
3.  **Remote Command Execution (Indirect):** Although initially intended to only execute `command -v`, the downloaded configuration file could potentially be manipulated to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system.
4.  **Information Leak:** The tool sends potentially sensitive information, including the server's IP address, system binaries, packages, and MySQL variables, to Percona without explicit user consent or knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker performing a MITM attack can inject malicious commands into the configuration file downloaded by Percona Toolkit. This leads to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive configuration information from the MySQL server and the system itself, such as server IP address, binaries, packages, and MySQL variables, through a manipulated configuration.
3.  **Unwanted Data Transmission:** Percona collects data without user knowledge or consent, which can be considered a privacy violation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts the HTTP connection between the Percona Toolkit and the remote server `http://v.percona.com/` to inject malicious configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user's machine and Percona's server. This could be done on the same local network (e.g., WiFi) or through a compromised network infrastructure.
*   The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the data being transmitted over the HTTP connection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `--version-check` feature was enabled by default in Percona Toolkit 2.2 (for certain tools) and disabled by default in 2.1.
*   The command execution part was later tracked under a separate bug report, [bug #1285166](https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit/+bug/1285166) .
*   The issue was fixed in Percona Toolkit 2.2.7
