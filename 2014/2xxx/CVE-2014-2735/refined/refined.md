The provided content relates to CVE-2014-2735.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the WinSCP client does not verify the server hostname against the certificate's Common Name or Subject Alternative Name during TLS/SSL handshake.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper hostname verification against the server certificate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack by presenting a certificate for a different host and potentially intercept sensitive information or impersonate the legitimate server.

**Attack vectors:**
- A MitM attacker intercepts the network traffic between the client and the server.
- The attacker presents a certificate issued for a different hostname to the client.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the WinSCP client and the legitimate server.
- The attacker needs a valid TLS/SSL certificate issued for a different host, and must be able to present it to the WinSCP client.
