# Dispute of Vulnerability CVE-2014-2734

Posted by emboss on 9 May 2014

We were recently informed about a possible security vulnerability that has
been published as
[CVE-2014-2734](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-2734).
However, based on our detailed analysis below, we do **not** consider Ruby
to be vulnerable.

This vulnerability could possibly allow an attacker to forge arbitrary root
certificates by modifying the certificate’s signature, effectively replacing
the certificate’s original private key with one chosen by the attacker.

## Proof of Concept

The following is our analysis of CVE-2014-2734, we were able to reduce the
original PoC, which we believe captures the essence of the proof of concept:

```
require 'openssl'

forge_key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(2048)
raw_certificate = File.read("arbitrary.cer")
cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(raw_certificate)
resigned_cert = cert.sign(spoof, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new)

resigned_cert.verify(key) #=> true
```

It may come as a surprise that `X509Certificate#verify` returns `true`.
The original certificate may contain a
[Subject Public Key Info](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.7)
pointing to the original public key which is different from the public key of
`forge_key`. Clearly, the public / private key pair that was used to re-sign
the certificate no longer matches the original public key referenced in the
Subject Public Key Info. Why does `#verify` return `true`?

### How keys are verified

`X509Certificate#verify` uses OpenSSL’s
[`X509_verify`](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/x509/x_all.c#L74)
function internally, which delegates to
[`ASN1_item_verify`](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/crypto/asn1/a_verify.c#L134).
These functions establish the validity of the signature given the public key
that was presented. However, they will **not** verify if the given key
actually matches any subject public key referenced in the certificate.
This means that returning `true` is expected behavior for `X509Certificate#verify`
in this scenario. Omitting this check has no significant impact on the overall
security of the X.509 trust model.

Section 4.1.1.3 of RFC 5280 explicitly states that by computing a
certificate’s signature, the CA confirms the correctness of the information
contained in the certificate. While this principle is violated in the above
example code, it poses no threat to security. A certificate forged or modified
in this way cannot be exploited unless someone is able to convince you to
explicitly trust a certificate that violates this principle.

## Potential risks

There are two cases to consider:

### Re-signing a root certificate

As users, we trust root certificates unconditionally. Even if they do not
contain valid information, the status of being a publicly acknowledged root
certificate alone is what keeps them pristine. They are preconfigured values
in the trust stores of our browsers or operating systems. Simply possessing
them establishes their status as valid trust anchors. For example, OpenSSL
itself does not check the signature of self-signed root certificates by
default for the same reasons,
cf. [X509\_V\_FLAG\_CHECK\_SS\_SIGNATURE documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/crypto/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags.html).

A re-signed root certificate becomes a de facto “self-signed” certificate
(albeit with incorrect Subject Public Key Info). This is not any more
dangerous than a normal self-signed root certificate. In fact, anyone can
produce self-signed root certificates which may completely match that of a
valid root certificate - except for the signature. Since we trust root
certificates merely by possession, such an imposter certificate is meaningless
without a client’s active consent to trust it.

### Re-signing an intermediate or leaf certificate

Also, re-signing a non-root certificate does not violate the security of the
X.509 trust model. While we usually do not possess these kinds of certificates
in advance, their forgery would be detected during the
[path validation procedure](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-6).
Here, any non-root certificate’s signature is verified using the public key
of the issuing certificate. At some point in the certificate chain, the forgery
would be ultimately detected in the form of an invalid certificate signature
value.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, we believe that `X509Certificate#verify` operates as expected.
Others have independently arrived at the
[same conclusion](https://github.com/adrienthebo/cve-2014-2734/)
and we have therefore disputed CVE-2014-2734, and asked for its revocation.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

The PoC is really hard to read and understand. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [steveklabnik](user?id=steveklabnik) [on April 17, 2014](item?id=7602076)   | [parent](#7602018) | [next](#7602191) [–]  I don't fully get it either, but I think it has to do with what happens when you call PKey::RSA.to\_pem: [http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/P...](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/PKey/RSA.html#method-i-to_pem) I think that it'll calculate the private key, which you can then smuggle out to another file before you're supposed to be able to? The CVE number is just reserved at the time I'm posting this: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-2734> Maybe in a few hours we'll have more information. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jvdh](user?id=jvdh) [on April 17, 2014](item?id=7602191)   | [prev](#7602018) | [next](#7602333) [–]  As far as I understand it this has very little impact on the security of OpenSSL and can only be abused by someone with access to a signing system (and then you have more problems anyway). What happens is that during the signing phase the certificate up the chain is read and checked, then during the generation this root certificate can be swapped out form underneath the process, and the generation proceeds as if nothing happened. This means that the newly inserted root certificate is inserted into the chain of trust, while it was not explicitly added. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [adrienthebo](user?id=adrienthebo) [on April 17, 2014](item?id=7602333)   | [prev](#7602191) [–]  I have a couple realizations from this. First off, at some point I became the person that would dig into a PoC for Ruby/OpenSSL/X509 bugs for hours. I've become a monster. Secondly, I think that this is entirely wrong. Standard disclaimer: I'm not a professional cryptographer. I have had to beat my head against ruby and the OpenSSL x509 bindings, so I know enough to probably make some very wrong statements. That being said, the PoC is full of glaring errors. The ctx and cipher objects are created but never used. the Extension Factory is created and then entirely ignored because it's only used for the #issuer\_certificate method. In addition, x509v3 extensions aren't used in any way during this PoC, so it has no reason to be there. And that's just the beginning. I went through and picked apart the code in small bits to remove obfuscation and unnecessary actions while preserving the displayed output. Here's the massively cleaned up version: ```   #!/usr/bin/env ruby      require 'openssl'      key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(2048)   puts "Spoof must be in PEM format and saved as ca.pem"   raw = File.read "ca.pem"   ca_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new raw      puts "before we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}"   ca_cert.sign(key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new)   puts "after we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}"      puts "Hijacked Certificate with chainloaded key saved  @ #{ca_cert.serial}.pem"   printf "Verifying Keys Intergity: "   puts  ca_cert.verify(key)  ``` This removes all the variable duplications, doesn't write files because they have absolutely no impact on the behavior, and still displays the same output as the given PoC. With a few final modifications it looks like this: ```   #!/usr/bin/env ruby      require 'openssl'      key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(2048)   ca_cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(File.read("ca.pem"))      puts "before we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}"   ca_cert.sign(key, OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new)   puts "after we sign the cert: #{ca_cert.verify(key)}"  ``` So what we've managed to demonstrate is that you can as a matter of fact sign SSL certificates with a private key. Once again I may have \_entirely\_ missed the point on this and deleted a subtle line that had a major effect on the code. However with the sheer number of lines that were purely cargo culted for SSL implementations, I really think that this isn't an issue. I have an entire history of how I started with the original PoC and how I converted it to the above examples at <https://github.com/adrienthebo/cve-2014-2734> ; please check it out if you think I made a mistake in my work. | | --- | --- | --- | | |

|  | # this is not a security-critical issue IMO. A certificate resigned this way |
|  | # cannot be used for anything meaningful unless you tricked somebody into explicitly |

```
Ruby openssl has a vulnerability when a public key is a issued prior writing to private key and is reopened during a
script it spoofs a CA private key.
