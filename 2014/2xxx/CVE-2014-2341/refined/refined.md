Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2341:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the application not ignoring the `PHPSESSID` parameter passed in the URL, allowing an attacker to specify their own session ID. Additionally, the login procedures do not generate new session IDs upon successful authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Session Fixation:** The application allows the session ID to be set through a URL parameter, and fails to regenerate the session ID upon successful login, making it vulnerable to session fixation.
*   **Insufficient Session Management:** Lack of proper session management. The application should generate a new session ID upon successful authentication to prevent session hijacking, but this is missing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can hijack a victim's session, gaining unauthorized access to the victim's account. This could lead to various malicious activities depending on the victim's privileges, such as gaining access to customer or administrator accounts, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized modifications of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attacker needs to get the victim to visit a URL containing a predefined session ID (`PHPSESSID`). This can be achieved through social engineering or malicious links.
*   The attacker must use the same User-Agent string as the victim to successfully hijack the session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable CubeCart instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to make the victim visit the crafted URL with the specific PHPSESSID.
*   The attacker needs to use the same User-Agent string as the victim.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects CubeCart version 5.2.8.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in CubeCart version 5.2.9.
*   A workaround for older versions involves restarting the session after login by adding `$GLOBALS['session']->restart();` in `admin.class.php` and `user.class.php`.
*   The vulnerability was reported by James Sibley (absane).
