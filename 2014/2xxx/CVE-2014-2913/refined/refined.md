Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2913:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor) not properly sanitizing user input, specifically command arguments, before passing them to a command shell via the `popen()` function.
- The NRPE daemon allows users to define commands with variables ($ARGn$) in the `nrpe.cfg` configuration file. When command arguments are enabled, these variables are substituted with user-provided values passed through the `check_nrpe` client with the `-a` option.
- Although NRPE attempts to filter out malicious characters with a blacklist (`NASTY_METACHARS`) and blocks bash command substitution `$(...)`, it fails to filter newline characters (`\n`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is that the lack of filtering for newline characters allows an attacker to inject additional commands into the command string executed by `popen()`.  Because `popen()` executes commands via a shell, newline characters act as command separators.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** NRPE's filtering mechanisms are inadequate, focusing on specific metacharacters and command substitution, while overlooking the newline character.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Remote Command Execution:** A remote attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands on the host running the NRPE daemon.
- **Privilege Escalation (Contextual):** The commands are executed with the privileges of the NRPE daemon user, which is typically the 'nagios' user. This could lead to further compromise of the server.
- **System Access:** By using commands like `wget` or `curl`, an attacker can download malicious scripts (e.g., Perl or Python) and execute them to gain a reverse shell, leading to unrestricted command-line access.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network, targeting the NRPE service.
- **NRPE client**: The attacker sends a crafted request using the `check_nrpe` client and including a newline character followed by malicious commands as arguments. For example:  `check_nrpe -H <host> -c <command> -a "`echo -e "\x0a malicious command"` #`" 4`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must have network access to the NRPE service.
- **NRPE Configuration:** The NRPE server must be configured to allow command arguments, meaning the `dont_blame_nrpe` setting is not set to 1 in the configuration and also has commands defined with arguments such as `$ARG1$`.
- **Knowledge of Target Environment:** Some familiarity with the target OS and network environment will help the attacker to execute more complex attacks

**Additional Information:**

- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was found in NRPE version 2.15 and older.
- The vulnerability is not present if command arguments are disabled (by setting `dont_blame_nrpe=1` in the `nrpe.conf`).
- The suggested fix by the Nagios security team involved quoting the macro arguments in the nrpe.cfg file (e.g. `command[check_ssh]=/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_ssh "$ARG1$"`).

This information aligns with the CVE description of a command injection vulnerability in Nagios NRPE.
