Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a bug in the Linux kernel's InfiniBand (IB) subsystem, specifically within the `cma_req_handler`. The code was attempting to resolve the passive side source MAC address during a connection request using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over Converged Ethernet (RoCE). This resolution process was redundant because it was already handled later during the modification of an RC QP to the RTR state by the ib_core module.
- The code incorrectly tried to look at the REQ member of the CM event, and dereferenced a random value, especially in the case of UD SIDR exchange.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect memory access:** The code was dereferencing a random value from a CM event's REQ member when handling UD SIDR exchanges.
- **Redundant code:** The MAC address resolution was performed twice: once incorrectly in the connection request handler and again correctly when modifying RC QPs to RTR.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a kernel crash due to invalid memory access.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote unprivileged user could trigger the crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** A remote user/program could exploit this flaw.
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered through network communication using the InfiniBand protocol over Converged Ethernet (RoCE).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send RDMA connection requests over RoCE to a vulnerable server.
- **Unprivileged Access:**  The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects systems that have `CONFIG_INFINIBAND` enabled with support for RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE).
- The fix for the vulnerability involves removing the redundant and buggy code for resolving the passive side source MAC address from `cma_req_handler`.
- The fix was introduced in commit `b2853fd6c2d0f383dbdf7427e263eb576a633867` and addresses the issue that was introduced in commit `dd5f03beb4f76ae65d76d8c22a8815e424fc607c`.

**Summary of Patches:**
- The patches remove the `ib_update_cm_av` function, and remove the code that attempted to resolve the MAC address within the `cma_req_handler`.
- This involves changes to `drivers/infiniband/core/cm.c`, `drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c`, and `include/rdma/ib_cm.h`.
