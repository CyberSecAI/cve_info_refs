I don't know if it maybe supports other database types and just uses mysql by default, so it may not be appropriate to have it actually require it, you might just have to know you're using that database type and install it. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=12820#c6)  claire robinson    2014-02-28 12:36:37 CET  ``` Right, yeah. It was pulling in php-pdo_mysql but with php-mysql installed it shows one less warning on the installation check.  Note: on the DB configuration page, don't click "Add new database" just click "Write" to write the config file, then continue and log in as "Setup/Config Admin Login".  It then goes through several steps making you click buttons but does install the database and then tries the applications too but fails again..

As a further comment on this, Egidio Romano has pointed out that the
code execution example is not exploitable. However the file deletion
issue still is fully exploitable.
Egroupware contains lots of classes with magic methods, some of which
might be exploitable (I haven't tested them all). Therefore I am
changing this to a POSSIBLE remote code execution instead of a
definite code execution.

Thanks to Egidio for pointing it out and validating my advisory. I've
updated the advisory in the repository.

Regards,
Pedro

We could not immediately determine whether the egroupware-1.8.005.txt
disclosure means that:

  Arbitrary file overwrite in __destruct:

  Remote code execution in __destruct:

are both exploitable only as a consequence of unsafe unserialize use.
If eliminating the unsafe unserialize use would not completely address
those issues, additional CVE IDs may be needed.

There are no new CVE assignments yet for possible other issues in the
1.8.006.20140217 changelog entry, such as:

  CalDAV/Calendar: fixed permanent auth request in iCal, if
  accountselection is set to "selectbox with groupmembers" and rights
  granted from group without being a member

  SiteMgr: fixed not working anonymous user and using now a random
  password

# eGroupWare: Remote code execution — GLSA **201711-12**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in eGroupWare, the worst
of which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/egroupware** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | <= **1.8.004.20120613** |
| Unaffected versions |  |

### Background

eGroupWare is a suite of web-based group applications including
calendar, address book, messenger and email.

### Description

It was found that eGroupWare contains multiple code injection
vulnerabilities in multiple parameters and routes because of improper
input sanitization.

### Impact

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code, delete arbitrary files
or inject arbitrary PHP objects via multiple routes.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

Gentoo has discontinued support for eGroupWare and recommends that users
unmerge the package:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "www-apps/egroupware"

```
