  "cve": "CVE-2014-2027",
  "description": "eGroupWare prior to 1.8.006.20140217 is vulnerable to remote file deletion and possible remote code execution due to user input being passed to PHP's unserialize() method.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the use of the PHP `unserialize()` function on user-supplied data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization of user-provided input."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote file deletion and possible remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "By passing malicious serialized data to the application.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted serialized data to the eGroupware server. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, hence the attacker can be unauthenticated."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "eGroupWare versions prior to 1.8.006.20140217"

  ],
  "additional_notes": "The initial report suggested RCE, later it was clarified that the code execution is 'possible' but file deletion is fully exploitable. The fix was to remove the use of PHP unserialize."
