Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-2902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authorization of CA certificates when signing other certificates within the wolfssl library. Specifically, wolfssl did not correctly verify if a CA certificate was authorized to sign other certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper authorization of CA certificates
- Insufficient validation of certificate signing authority

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially spoof servers by using a crafted certificate that is signed by an unauthorized CA. This could lead to:
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
- Data interception
- Compromised authentication
- Potentially unauthorized access to services

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create a malicious certificate
- Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting or manipulating network traffic

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in wolfssl versions before 3.2.0.
- The issue was addressed in the 3.2.0 release of wolfssl.
- The vulnerability was also present in the cyassl package, which was later renamed to wolfssl.
- The vulnerability was identified in a research paper ("Semantic discrepancies in certificate validation")
- Debian bug reports 770229 and 792646 tracked the issue.
