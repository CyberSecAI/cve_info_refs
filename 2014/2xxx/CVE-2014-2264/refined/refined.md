- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Synology DiskStation Manager VPN module contains a hard-coded password for the 'root' user, which cannot be changed through the standard administrative interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the presence of a hard-coded password ("synopass") for the 'root' user within the VPN server module. This bypasses normal authentication mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can connect to the VPN server using the hard-coded credentials, potentially gaining access to the Synology device, and other devices on the shared network. This could lead to unauthorized data access or device control.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, achieved by sending a VPN authentication request with the username "root" and the password "synopass" to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the VPN server of the vulnerable Synology device. No prior authentication is required.
