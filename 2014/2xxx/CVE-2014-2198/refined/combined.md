| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:H/RL:OF//CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 0.0 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 0.0 |

Customers   running any Cisco Unified CDM Platform Software release should   request the hotfix patch called "*ssh\_keys\_cleanup*" through the normal support   channel. The hotfix addresses only the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability.         **Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability**      This vulnerability affects all Cisco Unified CDM Application Software versions prior to 10Determining the Running Software VersionThe software version for both Cisco Unified CDM Application Software and Platform Software can be determined by accessing the Administration GUI and navigating the **About** menu options on the top left corner of the page.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) is not affected by these vulnerabilities.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager (Cisco Unified CDM) is a service delivery and management platform that   provides automation and administrative functions over the Cisco Unified   Communications Manager, Cisco Unity Connection, and Cisco Jabber   applications, as well as the associated phones and soft clients.       CUCDM is part of Cisco Hosted Collaboration System (HCS). The Cisco Unified CDM solution includes an Application Software and a Platform Software.      **Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the web framework of the   Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Application Software could allow an   authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and gain   administrative access to the affected system.      The vulnerability   is due to improper implementation of authentication and authorization   controls of the Administration GUI. An attacker could exploit this   vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL to change the administrative credentials of a user.   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system or convince a valid user of the Administration GUI to click a   malicious link.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCun49862](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCun49862) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifier CVE-2014-2197.      **Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the implementation of the framework that allows access to   support representatives of the Cisco   Unified Communications Domain Manager Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated,   remote attacker to connect to the affected system with the privileges of   the *root* user.      The vulnerability is due to the presence of   a default SSH private key, which is stored in an insecure way on the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining the SSH   private key. For example, the attacker might reverse engineer the binary file of the operating system.   This will allow the attacker to connect by using the support account to the   system without requiring any form of authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the system with the privileges of the *root* user.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCud41130](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCud41130) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2198.      **Note:** Due to an error in the fix, all Cisco Unified CDM Platform Software releases are   vulnerable regardless if a previous patch has been applied due to this security advisory. Customers   running any Cisco Unified CDM Platform Software release should   request the hotfix patch called "*ssh\_keys\_cleanup*" through the normal support   channel. The hotfix addresses only the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability.   The error in the fix is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuq99452](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuq99452) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only).         **Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability**      A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Application Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access and modify BVSMWeb portal user information such as settings in the personal phone directory, speed dials, Single Number Reach, and call forward settings.      The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of authentication and authorization controls when accessing some web pages of the BVSMWeb portal. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL to the affected system.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCum77041](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCum77041) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-3300  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that mitigate the vulnerabilities in this security advisory.      Customers that are affected by the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability should use the functionality offered by the Cisco Unified Communication Manager and the Cisco Unified CDM Self-Care portal instead of the Cisco Unified CDM BVSMWeb portal to provide services.      Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the Cisco Applied Intelligence companion document for this advisory:    <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=34689>  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. **Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**      The Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability is resolved in Cisco Unified CDM Application Software usm-8.1.4-ubuntu10\_04.tar.gz and later.         **Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability**      The Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability is resolved in Cisco Unified CDM Platform Software hotfix patch called "*ssh\_keys\_cleanup*" .      **Note:** Due to an error in the fix, all Cisco Unified CDM Platform Software releases are   vulnerable regardless if a previous patch has been applied due to this security advisory. Customers   running any Cisco Unified CDM Platform Software release should   request the hotfix patch called "*ssh\_keys\_cleanup*" through the normal support   channel. The hotfix addresses only the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability.         **Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability**      Currently, there is no Cisco Unified CDM version that addresses the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability. Cisco Unified CDM Application Software version 10 and later does not implement the BVSMWeb service interface and it is not affected by this vulnerability. Cisco Unified CDM version 10 is expected to be available in September 2014. Customers that are concerned about this vulnerability should apply the mitigation detailed in the "Workarounds" section of this advisory until a fixed software release is available.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. The Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability and Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability were reported to Cisco by Fatih Ozavci from Sense of Security.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
