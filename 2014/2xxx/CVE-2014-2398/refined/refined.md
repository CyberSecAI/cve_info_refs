Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-2398:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an insufficient escaping of user-controlled input within the javadoc tool when generating HTML documentation. This occurs in the JavaScript code responsible for setting the browser window title when navigating between pages of the generated API documentation. Specifically, HTML special characters `<` and `>` were not escaped properly

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The insufficient escaping allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code that is then executed in the context of the domain that hosts the generated API documentation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the website hosting the Javadoc documentation
- **Cross-Site Scripting Attacks (XSS):** Attackers can exploit this to perform XSS attacks, which may lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Information theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted input:** The attack vector is through specially crafted user-controlled input that is used by the Javadoc tool to construct JavaScript code for setting the browser window title.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User controlled input:** Attackers must be able to influence or control input that will be processed by the Javadoc tool during documentation generation. This could potentially involve contributing to the source code or influencing the build process in some way.
- **Hosting or control of web server:** Attackers need to be able to host the malicious generated Javadoc documentation on a website, or influence the hosting location.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is specifically in the way javadoc generates JavaScript and is triggered when the generated documentation is viewed in a web browser.
- The original fix attempted to escape quotes and non-ASCII characters, but missed HTML special characters.
- Red Hat explicitly acknowledges that this vulnerability was discovered by their Security Response Team.

The provided data also highlights the multiple affected products, including:
- OpenJDK
- IcedTea
- Oracle Java SE, JavaFX, and JRockit
- Several Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions, as well as corresponding versions of Oracle Java for RHEL, Red Hat Network Satellite Server, etc.
- Various Oracle software products such as Fusion Middleware, E-Business Suite, and others.
- HP-UX systems running specific versions of HP JDK/JRE

The data indicates that fixes were made available through Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory for April 2014 as well as specific fixes within IcedTea (1.13.3, 2.4.7) and OpenJDK upstream commits.
