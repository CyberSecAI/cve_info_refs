- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper input validation in the web interfaces of Siemens SINEMA server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way the SINEMA web interfaces (ports 4999/TCP and 80/TCP) handle HTTP requests. Specially crafted HTTP requests can cause a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation results in a denial of service of the SINEMA web interfaces. The web interfaces can only be recovered by restarting the SINEMA server via the SINEMAserver-Monitor.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable web interfaces (ports 4999/TCP and 80/TCP).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the server. No authentication is required.
