Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2886:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way gksu handles command arguments, particularly when not running in `SUDO_MODE`. When `gksu` is invoked without the `--sudo-mode` flag (or if the configuration setting `/apps/gksu/sudo-mode` is not set to `true`), the command arguments are not properly escaped. This contrasts with `SUDO_MODE` where the code explicitly checks for single quotes and backslashes in the arguments and escapes them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Handling:** The core weakness is the lack of consistent argument escaping in `gksu` when not using sudo mode. This means that special characters in the command arguments such as single quotes (`'`) and backslashes (`\`), will be interpreted differently than intended, leading to unexpected behavior and potential command injection.
- **Mode-Dependent Behavior:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that the escaping behavior is dependent on whether `gksu` is running in `SUDO_MODE` or not. This inconsistency makes it difficult for users to predict how commands will be interpreted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  By crafting specific command arguments with unescaped special characters, an attacker could potentially inject and execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended restrictions and execute commands not intended by the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Command-Line Arguments:** The primary attack vector is via command-line arguments passed to `gksu`.  An attacker must be able to control the arguments passed to the gksu command in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Local Exploitation:** The attacker likely needs to have local access to execute commands using gksu.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to be able to execute `gksu` with manipulated arguments.
- **Command Execution:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute commands on the system, and be able to invoke `gksu`.
- **Understanding of gksu Behavior:** The attacker needs to be aware of the inconsistent argument escaping behavior in `gksu`.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The issue was originally reported on Launchpad as bug #1186676 and on Savannah as bug #40023.
*   The bug was confirmed to be present in multiple Ubuntu releases (13.04, 14.04, 16.04 and 16.10).
*   Gentoo has discontinued support for `gksu` and recommends users to unmerge the package.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of gksu <= 2.0.2.
*   The vulnerability was exploitable remotely according to Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA). This seems to contradict other information that points to local access.

In summary, the vulnerability in `gksu` arises from inconsistent argument handling which can lead to arbitrary command execution when specific input is provided.
