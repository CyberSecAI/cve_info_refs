{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code was missing proper sanitization of user-provided values before using them in the application's UI.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to missing or incomplete sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application's UI. This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, data theft, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious code into user-provided values, such as input fields, that are then displayed on the UI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to find a way to inject unsanitized input into the application. This could be through forms, URL parameters, or other user input mechanisms."
