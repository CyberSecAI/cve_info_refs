How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenât normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Revolution 2.2.11 was released today. It includes two security fixes including one affecting the phpThumb library that ships with Revo. In addition, it eliminates a bug that appeared in Google Chrome 32 and adds an alert notifying users to confirm navigation to prevent losing unsaved changes.

As this release contains security fixes, we recommend upgrading all your sites. If you're using [MODX Cloud](https://modxcloud.com/), this just takes a couple clicks.

2.3 is coming and we'll have an update on what we've been up to, soon.

Here are the highlights of changes in the 2.2.11 release:

* Update phpThumb to 1.7.11-beta to close security vulnerability
* Prevent XSS on actionVar in header.tpl in the Manager
* Eliminate unwanted "confirm navigation" alerts in Chrome 32+
* Added intentional "confirm navigation" to prevent loss of unsaved changes
* Fix caching of manager menus. Until now, they may not have been ever cached
* For more details, read the complete [changelog](https://raw.github.com/modxcms/revolution/v2.2.11-pl/core/docs/changelog.txt)

Here's what you need to get started or upgrade to MODX Revolution 2.2.11:

* [Download Revolution 2.2.11](https://modx.com/download/ "Download MODX")
