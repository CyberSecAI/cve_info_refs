Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an arbitrary file upload issue in the `FileUploadServlet` component of Oracle Event Processing.
*   It stems from a directory traversal flaw, which allows an attacker to specify the destination path of the uploaded file using `../` sequences in the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The `FileUploadServlet` allows uploading files without authentication.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The lack of proper path validation enables attackers to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The vulnerable component can be accessed without any authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious executable file, which can then be executed on the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wlevs/visualizer/upload` endpoint.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The request includes multipart form data, with the filename containing directory traversal sequences and the malicious file as the content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Oracle Event Processing server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of the Target Path:** The attacker needs to have some knowledge of the file system path on the server to upload the malicious files in the correct location.

**Additional Technical Details (from exploit-db):**

*   The exploit code uses the Metasploit framework.
*   By default, uploads are stored in `C:\Oracle\Middleware\user_projects\domains\<DOMAIN>\defaultserver\upload\`.
*   The exploit uses a `DEPTH` parameter to control the traversal depth.
*   The exploit uploads both a payload executable (`.exe`) and a MOF (Managed Object Format) file to trigger the execution of the payload.
*   The exploit is designed to target Windows 2003 SP2 or older, making use of WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) through WbemExec.
*  The module includes a check function that can detect vulnerable instances of Oracle Event Processing based on the server's response.

**Affected Products (from Oracle Advisory):**

*   Oracle Event Processing version 11.1.1.7.0

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited. The Exploit-DB entry provides additional practical detail including the metasploit module for exploitation.
