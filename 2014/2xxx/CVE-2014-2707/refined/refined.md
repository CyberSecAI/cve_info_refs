Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2707:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper filtering of remote printer names and strings within the `cups-browsed` daemon. Specifically, the `cups-browsed` daemon constructs a filter-script using `snprintf`, which includes parameters such as the printer model name and pdl (Page Description Language). These parameters are taken from LAN packets. Due to insufficient sanitization of these values, an attacker can inject arbitrary code into the generated filter-script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is command injection. By crafting malicious network packets containing specially crafted printer names or pdl values, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the filter-script executed by `cups-browsed`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system with the privileges of the `cups-browsed` process. This can lead to complete system compromise if the `cups-browsed` runs with high privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the Bonjour broadcast functionality of `cups-browsed`.
*   **Malicious Network Packets:** Attackers send specially crafted Bonjour broadcast packets to trigger the vulnerability, injecting malicious code via crafted printer names or pdl values within the packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable system to send malicious Bonjour broadcast packets.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require any authentication, making it easier for an attacker to exploit.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability and how to craft the necessary malicious packets.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `cups-filters` version 1.0.51.
*   The vulnerable functionality is enabled by the `CreateIPPPrinterQueues` configuration directive in `/etc/cups/cups-browsed.conf`, and was disabled by default in Fedora.
*   Ubuntu's fix includes additional sanitization of remote queue names and a fix for a separate issue where invalid BrowseAllow directives were ignored.
*  The fix involves sanitizing the remote queue name in `utils/cups-browsed.c` and denying access if the `BrowseAllow` option is invalid.
* The issue is present in versions of `cups-filters` after version 1.0.41.
