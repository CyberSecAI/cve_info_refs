  "CVE-2014-2284": {
    "description": "A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the decode_icmp_msg() function in the ICMP-MIB implementation processed Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message statistics reported in the /proc/net/snmp file. A remote attacker could send a message for each ICMP message type, which could potentially cause the snmpd service to crash when processing the /proc/net/snmp file.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "net-snmp releases 5.5 through 5.7.2",
      "< 5.7.3_pre3 (Gentoo)",

    "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in the decode_icmp_msg() function when processing ICMP message statistics.",
