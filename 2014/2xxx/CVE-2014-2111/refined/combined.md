Affected Products  * These vulnerabilities affect devices that are running vulnerable versions of Cisco IOS Software and have NAT configured.   Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices that are running Cisco IOS Software are vulnerable when configured for NAT.      There are two methods to determine whether a device is configured for NAT:   + Determine whether NAT is active on a device   + Determine whether NAT commands are included in the device configurationThe preferred method to verify whether NAT is enabled on a Cisco IOS device is to determine whether NAT is active on a device.Determine Whether NAT is Active on a DeviceTo determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS Software configuration, log in to the device and issue the **show ip nat statistics** command. If NAT is active, the sections **Outside interfaces** and **Inside interfaces** will each include at least one interface. The following example shows a device on which the NAT feature is active: ```   Router# show ip nat statistics      Total translations: 2 (0 static, 2 dynamic; 0 extended)   Outside interfaces: Serial0   Inside interfaces: Ethernet1   Hits: 135  Misses: 5   Expired translations: 2   Dynamic mappings:   -- Inside Source   access-list 1 pool mypool refcount 2    pool mypool: netmask 255.255.255.0           start 192.168.10.1 end 192.168.10.254           type generic, total addresses 14, allocated 2 (14%), misses 0   ``` Determine Whether NAT Commands are Included in the Device ConfigurationAlternatively, to determine whether NAT has been enabled in the Cisco IOS Software configuration, the **ip nat inside** and **ip nat outside** commands must be present in different interfaces, or in the case of the [NAT Virtual Interface](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios-xml/ios/ipaddr_nat/configuration/15-s/iadnat-addr-consv.html#GUID-1B07F018-EEE8-40AF-953E-7E674D5E4A23), the **ip nat enable** interface command will be present.      **Note:** The Cisco Easy VPN Remote client feature configuration present on the device will automatically enable NAT.       The NAT and Port Address Translation (PAT) configurations that are created by the Cisco Easy VPN Remote feature are not written to the startup or running configuration files. These configurations, however, can be displayed using the **show ip nat statistics** command.Determine the Cisco IOS Software Release To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableA Cisco IOS device is not vulnerable if the NAT feature is not configured.      The following products have been confirmed not vulnerable:   + Cisco IOS XR Software   + Cisco IOS XE Software   + Cisco NX-OS Software   + Cisco ASA SoftwareNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco IOS Software implementation of the Network Address Translation (NAT) feature contains two vulnerabilities when translating IP packets that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.Cisco IOS Software NAT DNS VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the Application Layer Gateway (ALG) module of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to the way certain malformed DNS packets are processed on an affected device when those packets undergo Network Address Translation (NAT). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DNS packets to be processed and translated by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device that would lead to a DoS condition.      This vulnerability cannot be exploited using IPv6 packets. The vulnerability can be triggered by both TCP and UDP DNS packets destined to port 53.      This vulnerability can only be triggered by the traffic transiting an affected device and cannot be exploited with traffic destined to it.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCue00996](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCue00996) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2111Cisco IOS Software TCP Input VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the TCP Input module of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak or a reload of the affected device which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to the way certain sequences of TCP packets are processed on an affected device when those packets undergo Network Address Translation (NAT). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific sequence of TCP packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak or reload of the affected device that would lead to a DoS condition.      This vulnerability cannot be triggered by the IPv6 traffic transiting an affected device and cannot be exploited with traffic destined to it.      While this vulnerability may cause an affected device to reload, it can also result in a memory leak.      To determine whether the vulnerability has been exploited on an affected device and the memory leak has been observed, issue the **show memory debug leaks chunks** command from the command-line interface.      The following example shows the output of an affected Cisco IOS device where there are observed memory leaks in **IP Input** in I/O memory region: ```   Router#show memory debug leaks chunks                                                                                                                                                         Adding blocks for GD...                                                                                                                                                                                         I/O memory                                                                                                                                                                    Address    Size   Alloc_pc  PID  Alloc-Proc       Name                                                                                                                                         Address    Size   Alloc_pc  PID  Alloc-Proc       Name29ECB984   1252   23371C48  164  IP Input        *Packet Header*   ``` **Note:** A memory leak in **IP Input** may be caused by many other features and is not a definite sign that this vulnerability has been exploited.      **Note:** The **show memory debug leaks chunks** command may be CPU intensive and should be used with caution.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID CSCuh33843 (registered customers only) and CSCuj41494 (registered customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2109  Workarounds  * Cisco IOS Software TCP Input VulnerabilityThere are no workarounds for this vulnerability.   Cisco IOS Software NAT DNS VulnerabilityThis vulnerability can be mitigated by configuring the NAT Translation of External IP Addresses Only feature.      In certain cases, it may be possible to not translate the addresses in the payload portion for the DNS packet. This requires the addresses in the DNS messages to be left without any change.      This is achieved by using the NAT Translation of External IP Addresses Only feature. This feature translates the addresses in the header portion alone, but leaves the payload portion untouched. This is useful in instances where communication is needed with non-translated addresses. To enable this feature, issue the **ip nat inside source static** or **ip nat outside source static** commands with the **no-payload** option.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.        In February 2014, Cisco announced details of an industry-wide issue with memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. Although the majority of Cisco products that use these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, a device reload or power cycle could expose component failures. While there are no known security implications associated with this issue, a subset of the affected products may experience a memory component failure during the software upgrade process. Cisco recommends customers review the related information and product-specific field notices at [www.cisco.com/go/memory](http://www.cisco.com/go/memory) before making upgrade decisions. Each Field Notice indicates whether the product could experience the memory component failure during a software upgrade. Cisco IOS Software The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) is the quickest method to determine exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The tool allows customers to quickly identify Cisco Security Advisories that impact specific Cisco IOS Software releases. Users can initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from their local system. The tool is also capable of parsing **show version** command output. Results can be customized by searching against all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all the advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication.       Customers can also use the Cisco IOS Software tables below to determine their exposure. Each row corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software release; if a particular release is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the second column. The third column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication.       **Expand to View Detailed Fixed Software Information**      | **Major Release** | **Availability of Repaired Releases** | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected 12.0-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.0 based releases | | |   | **Affected 12.2-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | 12.2EX | Vulnerable; First fixed in [Release 15.0SE](#15_0SE) | Vulnerable; First fixed in [Release 15.0SE](#15_0SE) |   | 12.2EY | Releases prior to 12.2(58)EY are vulnerable; Releases 12.2(58)EY and later are not vulnerable.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV:Â Local AV:Â Adjacent Network AV:Â Network  Access Complexity AC:Â High AC:Â Medium AC:Â Low  Authentication Au:Â Multiple Au:Â Single Au:Â None  Confidentiality Impact C:Â None C:Â Partial C:Â Complete  Integrity Impact I:Â None I:Â Partial I:Â Complete  Availability Impact A:Â None A:Â Partial A:Â Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E:Â Unproven  E:Â Proof-of-Concept  E:Â Functional  E:Â High  E:Â Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL:Â Official-Fix  RL:Â Temporary-Fix  RL:Â Workaround  RL:Â Unavailable  RL:Â Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC:Â Unconfirmed  RC:Â Uncorroborated  RC:Â Confirmed  RC:Â Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP:Â None  CDP:Â Low  CDP:Â Low-Medium  CDP:Â Medium-High  CDP:Â High  CDP:Â Not Defined   Target Distribution TD:Â None  TD:Â Low  TD:Â Medium  TD:Â High  TD:Â Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR:Â Not Defined  CR:Â Low  CR:Â Medium  CR:Â High   Integrity Requirement IR:Â Not Defined  IR:Â Low  IR:Â Medium  IR:Â High   Availability Requirement AR:Â Not Defined  AR:Â Low  AR:Â Medium  AR:Â High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |
