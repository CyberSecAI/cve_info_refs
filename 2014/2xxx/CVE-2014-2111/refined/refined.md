  "CVE-2014-2111": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The Cisco IOS Software implementation of the Network Address Translation (NAT) feature contains a vulnerability when translating IP packets that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the way certain malformed DNS packets are processed on an affected device when those packets undergo Network Address Translation (NAT).",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of malformed DNS packets during NAT processing leading to a device reload and denial of service."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed DNS packets to be processed and translated by an affected device. This is a remote, network-based attack.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device that is undergoing NAT."
