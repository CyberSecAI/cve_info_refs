Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2512:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in EMC Documentum eRoom. Specifically, two parameters are identified:

1.  `SupportMsg` parameter when creating a new database.
2.  `FieldName` parameter when creating a new database field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**. Due to the lack of input validation, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into these parameters, which is then stored by the application. When a user interacts with the stored data (e.g., viewing the database configuration or accessing error pages), the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal user session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.
*   **User Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate other users and perform actions on their behalf.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to documents and other resources stored in eRooms.
*  **JavaScript Worm:** The advisory mentions the possibility of using a JavaScript worm to crawl an eRoom and gather all available documents

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP POST requests to the eRoom server, including XSS payloads in the vulnerable parameters (`SupportMsg` and `FieldName`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable eRoom server.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication to exploit the `SupportMsg` parameter when creating a new database.

**Technical Details:**

*   The advisory provides two specific proof-of-concept exploits:
    1.  The first exploit targets the `SupportMsg` parameter. The provided payload is:
        `%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C%2Fscript%3E` which translates to `"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`. This payload, when executed, attempts to display an alert box containing the user's cookies, which can be used to steal the user's session.
    2.  The second exploit targets the `FieldName` parameter. The provided payload is:
         `xxx%22%3E%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29+%2F%3E` which translates to `xxx"><img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie) />`. This payload, when rendered, attempts to execute the JavaScript alert on an error event of the image.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
 *   7.4.3, 7.4.4, 7.4.4 SP1

**Patched Versions:**
*   7.4.3 ESA-2014-060 (hot fix)
*   7.4.4 P19
*   7.4.4 SP1 ESA-2014-060 (hot fix)
