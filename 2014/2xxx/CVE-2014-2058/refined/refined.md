Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2058:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a flaw in the fix for SECURITY-55. Specifically, in the BuildTrigger functionality, the check for permissions on downstream projects was insufficient. It was possible for a user with limited permissions to configure a job (Job X) to trigger another job (Job Y) that they didn't have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The original fix for SECURITY-55 did not correctly enforce permission checks when triggering downstream builds using the BuildTrigger.
- **Bypass of Permission Checks:** Users could bypass access control checks to trigger builds of projects they weren't authorized to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Job Execution:** An attacker could trigger builds of jobs they don't have permissions for. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins environment, depending on what the downstream job does.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the provided documents do not explicitly mention privilege escalation in this context, the ability to trigger builds could lead to indirect privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Jenkins Configuration:** The attack is performed by maliciously configuring a job's BuildTrigger to target downstream jobs that the attacker has no direct access to.
- **Web UI or API:** The specific vector of configuring the job is not mentioned but could include the Jenkins web UI or any API that permits configuration changes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Jenkins User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid Jenkins user account.
- **Job Configuration Permissions:**  The attacker requires permissions to configure a job (Job X) they have access to.
- **Knowledge of Target Job:** The attacker must know the name or identifier of the target job (Job Y) they wish to trigger, which is not directly accessible to them, so they can configure the trigger to build it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a follow-up to SECURITY-55, highlighting the complexity of security fixes and the potential for incomplete patching.
- The fix involves checking permissions on the downstream projects during the BuildTrigger configuration.
- The provided GitHub commit includes changes to `AbstractProject.java` to properly check permissions using `SecurityContext` and new tests in `BuildTriggerTest.java` to confirm that unauthorized users are now blocked from triggering downstream builds.
