This content is related to CVE-2014-2864 as it describes multiple vulnerabilities in PaperThin CommonSpot CMS, which is associated with the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The primary root cause is that many of the individual ColdFusion pages (CFM files) that make up CommonSpot can be accessed directly, bypassing intended usage flows. These pages often accept untrusted input and lack proper security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing'):** Many individual CFM pages can be accessed directly, leading to unintended functionality and exposure of vulnerabilities.
*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** Many pages reflect data from HTTP requests back into HTTP responses without proper sanitization, allowing injection of HTML elements including scripts.
*   **CWE-284: Improper Access Control:** Inconsistent enforcement of access control allows anonymous access to many pages.
*   **CWE-285: Improper Authorization:** Lack of authorization checks before performing potentially dangerous actions.
*   **CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path:** Some pages accept user-supplied, fully-qualified file system paths as parameters.
*   **CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'):** File name parameters are vulnerable to directory traversal attacks.
*   **CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character:** Some pages allow attacker-provided strings to be terminated prematurely using null bytes, enabling control over file paths.
*  **CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security:** Some security restrictions are enforced on the client-side using JavaScript which can be bypassed by attackers.
*   **CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type:** Authenticated users can upload arbitrary ColdFusion pages leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter:** ColdFusion variables can be overridden via URI parameters (HTTP GET).
*   **CWE-200: Information Exposure:** Several pages disclose sensitive information including server name, filesystem paths, SQL server details, and administrative email/SMTP server addresses.
*   **CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** Cleartext credentials are stored by default in the database (though encryption is optional).
*   **CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information:** Login pages transmit credentials in cleartext.
*  **CWE-548: Information Exposure Through Directory Listing:** Arbitrary directory listings can be obtained.
*   **CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files:** Unauthenticated access to log file directory exposes server information.
*   **CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection'):** Allows unauthenticated arbitrary command execution with arbitrary parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote unauthenticated attacker can achieve a variety of impacts, including remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges on the server. This includes the ability to execute arbitrary code, steal authentication cookies, disclose sensitive server information, and gain control over the filesystem.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Direct requests to vulnerable CFM pages.
*   Injection of malicious scripts through XSS.
*   Path traversal via manipulated file name parameters.
*   Uploading malicious files.
*   Overriding ColdFusion variables through URI parameters.
*   Exploiting command injection.
*   Accessing directory listings and log files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker can be remote and unauthenticated. They require knowledge of the vulnerable CFM pages and can use standard web requests to exploit the system.
