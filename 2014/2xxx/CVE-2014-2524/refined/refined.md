{
  "CVE-2014-2524": {
    "Description": "The _rl_tropen() function in GNU Readline insecurely handles temporary file creation, potentially allowing local attackers to perform symbolic link attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Insecure use of `/var/tmp` for creating temporary files without proper checks or protections, leading to a race condition vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure temporary file handling",
      "Race condition"
    ],
    "Impact": "Local attacker can exploit the race condition to perform symbolic link attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized file access.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Symbolic link attack"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to create files and symbolic links",
       "Local system access"
    ],
    "Additional details": [
      "The vulnerable function `_rl_tropen()` is intended for debugging and is not directly invoked in normal application use cases.",
       "The vulnerable code is located in `util.c` of the readline library.",
       "The issue was addressed by disabling the vulnerable code by default in later readline versions (compiling only in DEBUG mode).",
      "Patches were created to fix this vulnerability in various distributions."
