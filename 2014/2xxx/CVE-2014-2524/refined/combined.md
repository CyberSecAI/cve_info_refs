Patch checked into Mageia 3 and Mageia 4 SVN.  I don't plan to push an update just for this, unless someone feels otherwise.  It sounds like a low severity issue that's extremely unlikely to ever be triggered.  Reproducible:   Steps to Reproduce: ```  David Walser    2014-06-10 20:00:50 CEST   Whiteboard: (none) => MGA3TOO  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=13512#c1)  David Walser    2014-07-23 20:56:15 CEST  ``` Fedora has issued an advisory on June 19: <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2014-July/135686.html>  In addition to the minor security issue (insecure use of /tmp in a function that isn't called by anything but is linked in and should have only been available in debug mode), it fixes an issue with slowness when pasting text, for which there is a PoC here: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1109946>  I've added the upstream patches for those, as well as one more for an infinite loop in vi editing mode.  See the Bug Description here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-6.2-patches/readline62-004  Patched packages uploaded for Mageia 3 and Mageia 4.  Advisory: ========================  Updated readline packages fix security vulnerability:  Steve Kemp discovered the _rl_tropen() function in readline insecurely handled a temporary file. This could allow a local attacker to perform symbolic link attacks (CVE-2014-2524).  Also, upstream patches have been added to fix an infinite loop in vi input mode, and to fix an issue with slowness when pasting text.

Already installed: lib64readline6-6.2-9.mga4 To compile one of the tests, needed to add: lib64readline-devel-6.2-9.mga4  There are 3 corrections in this update: 1. the _rl_tropen() function in readline insecurely handled a temporary file.  2. Attempting to redo (using `.') the vi editing mode `cc', `dd', or `yy' commands leads to an infinite loop. Ref:-  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-6.2-patches/readline62-004  3. When a program uses rl_event_hook to install a callback called by readline, the processing is very slow. It is best viewed by pasting a text as an input. The characters appears one by one, very slowly. Ref:-  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1109946> This last includes a test program with all its shell commands; it only needs copying/pasting command by command, very easy & quick.  1. Unable to test.  2. To get bash into vi mode, type:  $ set -o vi This leaves you in vi *input* mode. ESC puts you into command mode until the next vi input command. This URL:-  <http://www.catonmat.net/blog/bash-vi-editing-mode-cheat-sheet/> provides a few simple exercises to get the idea. HOWEVER I could *not* get the loop described, finding no reference anywhere to '.' as re-do, nor getting it to do anything. Do not know how to drive this test.  3. The test described does indeed display the string visibly slowly.  Updated to lib64readline6-6.2-9.1.mga4 & lib64readline-devel-6.2-9.1.mga4 Test 3 now does indeed output the string fast. Pity about test 2, but am OK-ing this anyway. Better if someone can crack how to drive test 2; it should be easy & definite. ```  ---   CC: (none) => lewyssmithWhiteboard: MGA3TOO => MGA3TOO MGA4-64-OK  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=13512#c3)  Rémi Verschelde    2014-08-01 15:22:32 CEST  ``` Lewis detailed a testing procedure in [comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=13512#c2). ```  ---   CC: (none) => remiWhiteboard: MGA3TOO MGA4-64-OK => MGA3TOO has\_procedure MGA4-64-OK  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=13512#c4)  David Walser    2014-08-01 15:42:55 CEST  ``` Validating this.

# Insecure usage of temporary files in GNU Readline

---

*From*: Steve Kemp <steve () steve org uk>

*Date*: Fri, 14 Mar 2014 18:05:31 +0000

---

```

  Whilst auditing some code for insecure uses of temporary
 files I spotted a potential area of concern in GNU readline.
 (via an embedded copy of the same inside the Debian source
 of GDB.)

  The code in question comes from readline 6.x and is contained
 in util.c:

int
_rl_tropen ()
{
  char fnbuf[128];

  if (_rl_tracefp)
    fclose (_rl_tracefp);
  sprintf (fnbuf, "/var/tmp/rltrace.%ld", getpid());
  unlink(fnbuf);
  _rl_tracefp = fopen (fnbuf, "w+");
  return _rl_tracefp != 0;
}

  _rl_tropen is invoked from _rl_trace, which is a debugging aid,
 and it is implied that the function is private, because it is defined
 in rlprivate.h:

/* rlprivate.h -- functions and variables global to the readline library,
          but not intended for use by applications. */

  That said the function _is_ available for using/linking, as
 a trivial test program would demonstrate:

       <http://pastebin.com/T0XimKED>

   Given how widely used this library is potentially many applications are
 unknowingly vulnerable to a classic race-condition.

  I'm throwing this out there for two reasons:

    * In theory this is exploitable, and should be fixed.

    * In practice I cannot find an application which invokes _rl_trace,
      although there are tantalising clues such as this page of commits
      which refers to a snapshot of GNU Bash:

            <https://gitlab.com/bminor/bash/commit/b0c16657b4514191b4f6c328615d162726758247>

   Feel free to allocate an identifier, or even scan some of your
 projects that have readline dependencies ;)

   This is the first announcement of this issue I've made, I can
 imagine some more paranoid distributions might wish to update, but
 equally this seems so low-risk that I didn't consider it worthy
 of vendor-sec.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1077023#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-17 03:06:51 UTC  ``` Steve Kemp discovered the _rl_tropen() function in readline, a set of libraries to handle command lines, insecurely handled a temporary file. This could allow a local attacker to perform symbolic link attacks. As noted in the CVE request, _rl_tropen() is typically only called during debugging.  CVE request: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/579>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1077023#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-17 03:08:47 UTC  ```  Created readline tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1077026](show_bug.cgi?id=1077026 "CLOSED ERRATA - readline: insecure temporary file use in _rl_tropen() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1077023#c4)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-17 03:47:38 UTC  ```  Created mingw-readline tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1077035](show_bug.cgi?id=1077035 "CLOSED ERRATA - mingw-readline: readline: insecure temporary file use in _rl_tropen() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1077023#c5)  Martin Prpič    2014-03-17 19:35:43 UTC  ``` MITRE assigned [CVE-2014-2524](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-2524) to this issue:  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/588>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1077023#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2014-05-26 13:38:34 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in 6.3 patch 3 by making the code only get compiled in when building with -DDEBUG.  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-readline/2014-03/msg00057.html> <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/readline.git/commit/?id=8408f86> ftp://ftp.cwru.edu/pub/bash/readline-6.3-patches/readline63-003   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1077023#c8)  Vincent Danen    2014-09-16 17:05:26 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue is only exposed via readline's debugging/tracing code and is not used by readline or any other application in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.  The tracing functions are defined in a private header file and are only meant for the readline library's internal use.  In general use, there is no exposure of this insecure temporary file issue, and while this does affect the versions of readline as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7 it is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.  Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: <https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/>.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=868822#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2014-03-18 07:00:55 UTC  ``` via oss-sec  From: Steve Kemp <steve@steve.org.uk> Subject: [oss-security] Insecure usage of temporary files in GNU Readline Date: Fri, 14 Mar 2014 18:05:31 +0000     Whilst auditing some code for insecure uses of temporary  files I spotted a potential area of concern in GNU readline.  (via an embedded copy of the same inside the Debian source  of GDB.)    The code in question comes from readline 6.x and is contained  in util.c:   int _rl_tropen () {   char fnbuf[128];    if (_rl_tracefp)     fclose (_rl_tracefp);   sprintf (fnbuf, "/var/tmp/rltrace.%ld", getpid());   unlink(fnbuf);   _rl_tracefp = fopen (fnbuf, "w+");   return _rl_tracefp != 0; }     _rl_tropen is invoked from _rl_trace, which is a debugging aid,  and it is implied that the function is private, because it is defined  in rlprivate.h:  /* rlprivate.h -- functions and variables global to the readline library,           but not intended for use by applications. */    That said the function _is_ available for using/linking, as  a trivial test program would demonstrate:         <http://pastebin.com/T0XimKED>   Given how widely used this library is potentially many applications are  unknowingly vulnerable to a classic race-condition.    I'm throwing this out there for two reasons:      * In theory this is exploitable, and should be fixed.      * In practice I cannot find an application which invokes _rl_trace,       although there are tantalising clues such as this page of commits       which refers to a snapshot of GNU Bash:              <https://gitlab.com/bminor/bash/commit/b0c16657b4514191b4f6c328615d162726758247>     Feel free to allocate an identifier, or even scan some of your  projects that have readline dependencies ;)     This is the first announcement of this issue I've made, I can  imagine some more paranoid distributions might wish to update, but  equally this seems so low-risk that I didn't consider it worthy  of vendor-sec.

openSUSE Security Update: bash: security and bugfix update
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2014:1226-1
Rating: critical
References: #868822 #895475 #896776
Cross-References: CVE-2014-2524 CVE-2014-6271
Affected Products:
openSUSE 13.1
openSUSE 12.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves two vulnerabilities and has one
errata is now available.
Description:
bash was updated to fix a critical security issue, a minor security issue
and bugs:
In some circumstances, the shell would evaluate shellcode in environment
variables passed at startup time. This allowed code execution by local or
remote attackers who could pass environment variables to bash scripts.
(CVE-2014-6271)
Fixed a temporary file misuse in \_rl\_tropen (bnc#868822) Even if used only
by developers to debug readline library do not
open temporary files from public location without O\_EXCL (CVE-2014-2524)
Additional bugfixes:
- Backported corrected german error message for a failing getpwd
(bnc#895475)
- Add bash upstream patch 47 to fix a problem where the function that
shortens pathnames for $PS1 according to the value of $PROMPT\_DIRTRIM
uses memcpy on potentially-overlapping regions
of memory, when it should use memmove. The result is garbled pathnames
in prompt strings.
- Add bash upstream patch 46 to fix a problem introduced by patch 32 a
problem with "$@" and arrays expanding empty positional parameters or
array elements when using substring expansion, pattern substitution, or
case modfication. The empty parameters
or array elements are removed instead of expanding to empty strings ("").
- Add bash-4.2-strcpy.patch from upstream mailing list to patch collection
tar ball to avoid when using \w in the prompt and changing the directory
outside of HOME the a strcpy work on
overlapping memory areas.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 13.1:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2014-559
- openSUSE 12.3:
zypper in -t patch openSUSE-2014-559
To bring your system up-to-date, use "zypper patch".

## Updated readline packages fix security vulnerability

Publication date: 06 Aug 2014

Modification date: 06 Aug 2014

Type: security

Affected Mageia releases :
[3](3.html)
,
[4](4.html)

CVE:
[CVE-2014-2524](CVE-2014-2524.html)

## Description

```
Steve Kemp discovered the _rl_tropen() function in readline insecurely handled
a temporary file. This could allow a local attacker to perform symbolic link
attacks (CVE-2014-2524).

Also, upstream patches have been added to fix an infinite loop in vi input
mode, and to fix an issue with slowness when pasting text.

```
