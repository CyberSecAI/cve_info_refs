| [Mon 10 Mar 2014 09:20:40 AM UTC, comment #8:](#comment8)   Update: you can use CVE-2014-2240 as the identifier of the vulnerability.   You can also use CVE-2014-2241 for the other fix you submitted in relation to this bug, if required (not necessary).   Thanks,  Mateusz | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Sat 01 Mar 2014 02:24:56 AM UTC, comment #7:](#comment7)   Thanks for the quick turn-around!   There isn't a CVE available yet; MITRE can only assign them based on public information, such as the recently submitted commit.   I am going to request one and get back to you once the allocation is made. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 08:30:39 AM UTC, comment #6:](#comment6)   Thanks a lot for the patches!  They are now in the git repository.  Right now I'm preparing a new release, to be available in one or two days, I guess.   Is there a CVE number already available? | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Fri 28 Feb 2014 02:00:53 AM UTC, comment #5:](#comment5)   The problem is triggered by a charstring with too many stem hints.   In the original font, asan\_stack-oob\_704686\_9216\_cov\_3502053733\_sigsegv2.ttf,  the problem occurs with glyph 15364. There are 150 stem hints.  Many incidental errors also occur:  "cff\_index\_access\_element: offset to next entry ..."  "tt\_face\_build\_cmaps: unsupported cmap sub-table ..."   In the second font, ftbench\_oob\_stack\_sigsegv.otf, there are 1,000,000 stem hints in glyph 47.   The error is correctly detected, but the program flow after the error is incorrect. The simplest fix is to return early from cf2\_hintmap\_build() when there is an invalid hint mask. | [Dave Arnold <darnold>](/users/darnold) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 05:33:18 PM UTC, comment #4:](#comment4)   Thanks, it now crashes properly :-) | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 05:06:52 PM UTC, comment #3:](#comment3)   Yes, I am pretty sure that's the right font. It's strange you have difficulty reproducing it, as the bitCount variable is clearly larger than the maximum legal value of 96 in the source code I referred to.   Anyway, here: <http://j00ru.vexillium.org/dump/ftbench_oob_stack_sigsegv.otf> you can find another font which crosses the stack buffer boundary not by just a few bits, but enough to reach the top of the stack and generate a SIGSEGV exception in a regular ftbench build:   --- cut ---  Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  820       if ( maskByte & \*maskPtr )  (gdb) where  #0  0x00007ffff7721bce in cf2\_hintmap\_build (hintmap=0x7fffffff7150, hStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd3b0, vStemHintArray=0x7fffffffd370,      hintMask=0x7fffffff7120, hintOrigin=0, initialMap=0 '\000')      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2hints.c:820  #1  0x00007ffff77249bd in cf2\_interpT2CharString (font=0x60e5c0, buf=0x7fffffffd620, callbacks=0x60e628, translation=0x7fffffffd5d0,      doingSeac=0 '\000', curX=0, curY=0, width=0x7fffffffd5cc)      at freetype2/src/cff/cf2intrp.c:1201  #2  0x00007ffff771febe in cf2\_getGlyphOutline (font=0x60e5c0, charstring=0x7fffffffd620, transform=0x7fffffffd650,      glyphWidth=0x7fffffffd64c) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2font.c:461  #3  0x00007ffff77205b1 in cf2\_decoder\_parse\_charstrings (decoder=0x7fffffffd770,      charstring\_base=0x7ffff6604df8 "\024PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001PP\001P"..., charstring\_len=3000007) at freetype2/src/cff/cf2ft.c:369  #4  0x00007ffff771d8e9 in cff\_slot\_load (glyph=0x60c9e0, size=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffgload.c:2840  #5  0x00007ffff7716013 in cff\_glyph\_load (cffslot=0x60c9e0, cffsize=0x60cc40, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/cff/cffdrivr.c:185  #6  0x00007ffff76e6659 in FT\_Load\_Glyph (face=0x60a8e0, glyph\_index=47, load\_flags=0)      at freetype2/src/base/ftobjs.c:726  #7  0x0000000000401acb in test\_load (timer=0x7fffffffe0a0, face=0x60a8e0, user\_data=0x0)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:249  #8  0x00000000004019f7 in benchmark (face=0x60a8e0, test=0x7fffffffe0f0, max\_iter=0, max\_time=2)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:216  #9  0x0000000000402fd8 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffe270)      at freetype2-demos/src/ftbench.c:1020  (gdb) x/10i $rip  => 0x7ffff7721bce <cf2\_hintmap\_build+493>: movzbl (%rax),%eax     0x7ffff7721bd1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+496>: and    -0x21(%rbp),%al     0x7ffff7721bd4 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+499>: test   %al,%al     0x7ffff7721bd6 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+501>: je     0x7ffff7721cd9 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+760>     0x7ffff7721bdc <cf2\_hintmap\_build+507>: mov    -0xb8(%rbp),%rax     0x7ffff7721be3 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+514>: mov    0x1c(%rax),%r8d     0x7ffff7721be7 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+518>: mov    -0xd4(%rbp),%edi     0x7ffff7721bed <cf2\_hintmap\_build+524>: mov    -0x30(%rbp),%rcx     0x7ffff7721bf1 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+528>: mov    -0x20(%rbp),%rdx     0x7ffff7721bf5 <cf2\_hintmap\_build+532>: mov    -0xc0(%rbp),%rsi  (gdb) x/10wx $rax  0x7ffffffff000: Cannot access memory at address 0x7ffffffff000  --- cut ---   I hope that helps, let me know if you have any luck with reproduction. | [Mateusz Jurczyk <j00ru>](/users/j00ru) Group Member |
| [Wed 26 Feb 2014 07:31:09 AM UTC, comment #2:](#comment2)   Thanks for the report.  Are you sure this is the right font?  Dave Arnold can't reproduce it (and me neither, but I don't have a 64bit system – however, I get an assertion at a different place, something that should be fixed also).   It would be very helpful if you could play with ftbench's -i option to help us find the triggering glyph index. | [Werner LEMBERG <wl>](/users/wl) Group administrator |

| [Tue 25 Feb 2014 08:43:38 PM UTC, **original submission:**](#comment0)   Tested on Ubuntu AMD64 with upstream FreeType2 and FreeType2-demos, reproduced with ./ftbench <file>.   This is a critical vulnerability in the CFF Rasterizer code recently contributed by Adobe, leading to potential arbitrary code execution in the context of the FreeType2 library client. It will require a CVE identifier and most likely a new stable library release.   I would like to ask you to keep the bug private until a new release is out.

# USN-2148-1: FreeType vulnerabilities

17 March 2014

FreeType could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened
a specially crafted font file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)

## Packages

* [freetype](/security/cves?package=freetype) - FreeType 2 is a font engine library

## Details

Mateusz Jurczyk discovered that FreeType did not correctly handle certain

malformed font files. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted

font file, a remote attacker could cause FreeType to crash or possibly

execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-2240](/security/CVE-2014-2240), [CVE-2014-2241](/security/CVE-2014-2241))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 13.10

* [libfreetype6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/freetype)
  -
  [2.4.12-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/freetype/2.4.12-0ubuntu1.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart your session to make all

# [FreeType](index.html)

FreeType is a freely available software
library to render fonts.

It is written in C, designed to be small, efficient,
highly customizable, and portable while capable of
producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most
vector and bitmap font formats.

Some products that use FreeType for rendering fonts on
screen or on paper, either exclusively or partially:

* [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html)
  and other free Unix operating system derivates like
  [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/)
  or [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/);
* Platforms for smart devices, including
  [Android](https://www.android.com/),
  [Tizen](https://www.tizen.org/), and
  [Roku](https://www.roku.com/how-it-works/roku-os);
* [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/), Apple's
  mobile operating system for iPhones and iPads;
* [ChromeOS](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os),
  Google's operating system for laptop computers;
* [ReactOS](https://reactos.org), a free open
  source operating system based on the best design
  principles found in the Windows NT
  architecture;
* [Ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/),
  a PostScript interpreter used in many printers;
* Web browser engines such as
  [Chromium](https://chromium.org),
  [WebKit](https://webkit.org),
  [Gecko](https://mozilla.org),
  and
  [Goanna](http://www.moonchildproductions.info/goanna.shtml).

Counting the above products only, you get more than a
*billion* devices that contain FreeType.

## News & Updates

#### FreeType 2.13.3

2024-08-12

The B/W rasterizer has become much faster; besides that,
it is a maintenance release.

As usual, a list of the more noteworthy changes can be
found in
the [release
notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.13.3/).

#### FreeType 2.13.2

2023-08-25

This is a maintenance release with only minor changes.

Details can be found in the
[release
notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.13.2/).

#### FreeType 2.13.1

2023-06-24

This is a maintenance release with only minor changes,
for example, a new load flag `FT_LOAD_NO_SVG`
to ignore glyphs in an `SVG` SFNT table, or a
new function `FT_Get_Default_Named_Instance` to
get the index of the default named instance of an OpenType
Variation Font.

Please check
[release
notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.13.1/) for more details.

#### FreeType 2.13.0

2023-02-09

This new release brings you a completely updated and
enhanced `ftinspect` demo program, which now
combines the functionality of almost all other graphical
FreeType demo programs into a single application based on
the Qt framework.

![ftinspect demo program](image/ftinspect.png)

Another two noteworthy features are related to OpenType
fonts: The ‘COLR’ v1 API is now considered as
stable, and
the [‘avar’
v2 extension](https://github.com/harfbuzz/boring-expansion-spec/blob/main/avar2.md) is supported.

Other news and changes can be found in the
[release
notes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.13.0/).

#### FreeType 2.12.1

2022-05-01

This is a maintenance release. All users should upgrade.
A list of the most important changes and fixes can be
found
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.12.1/).

#### FreeType 2.12.0

2022-03-31

The main new feature of this release is support for
OpenType fonts with an ‘SVG’ table, using an
external SVG rendering library. Other changes, fixes, and
improvements are documented
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.12.0/).

#### FreeType 2.11.1

2021-12-02

This is a maintenance release with no significant
changes. For more details on the various fixes and
changes please
see [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.11.1/).

#### FreeType 2.11.0

2021-07-19

Our new release brings an additional rendering module to
create Signed Distance Fields (SDF) for glyphs; it also
introduces an experimental interface to access
[‘COLR’ v1](https://github.com/googlefonts/colr-gradients-spec/)
fonts.

As usual, there are many more fixes and features; please
see [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.11.0/)
for more.

#### FreeType moved to freedesktop.org

2021-01-16

We are now using the infrastructure of
the [gitlab
instance of freedesktop.org](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype). All bug issues have been
imported (kudos to Anurag Thakur for doing this tedious
job!), together with the git repositories, which have been
renamed
to [freetype](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype)
and [freetype-demos](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype-demos)
(this is, we are dropping the ‘2’ in the
repository names).

The git repositories
at [Savannah](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/freetype/)
will stay as mirrors.

#### FreeType 2.10.4

2020-10-20

This is an emergency release, fixing a severe
vulnerability in embedded PNG bitmap handling
(see [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.4/)
for more).

All users should update immediately.

#### FreeType 2.10.3

2020-10-10

This is a maintenance release, having better support for
TrueType glyphs with overlapping contours. See
the [list
of changes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.3/) for more details.

A warning for distribution maintainers: Version 2.10.3
and later may break the build of ghostscript, due to
ghostscript's [use
of a withdrawn macro](https://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702985) that wasn't intended for external
usage. A fix is
available [here](https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=commitdiff;h=41ef9a0bc36b).

#### FreeType 2.10.2

2020-05-09

Besides various maintenance fixes, this release comes
with support
of [WOFF 2
fonts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WOFF2/). More details are listed in
the [list
of changes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.2/).

#### FreeType 2.10.1

2019-07-01

A new maintenance release, fixing bytecode hinting of
OpenType variation fonts and cmap processing of PCF fonts,
among other things. Check
the [list
of changes](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.1/) for more fixes.

#### FreeType 2.10.0

2019-03-15

This release brings one notable feature, namely support
for color-layered outline glyphs (for example, scalable
emoji glyphs). Additionally, the API reference has been
completely overhauled and modernized, as already
announced.

As usual, many minor fixes and corrections have been
applied also; a detailed list is
given [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.0/).

#### Website Makeover

2018-08-25

A revamped version of the FreeType website is available
for preview [here](https://nikramakrishnan.github.io/freetype-web-jekyll).
It includes a complete interface redesign, and uses
markdown as input which greatly improves maintainability.
Comments are welcome.

#### FreeType 2.9.1

2018-05-02

This is a maintenance release; most importantly fixing
correct handling of Type 1 fonts with flex features,
which was broken in version 2.9. An overview of the
remaining changes is
given [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.9.1/).
All users should upgrade.

#### FreeType 2.9

2018-01-08

FreeType version 2.9, the first release of a new
‘minor’ series, is now available for download.
The main reason for starting a new series is Ewald Hew's
GSoC contribution of making Adobe's CFF engine handle
Type 1 fonts also, greatly improving the rendering
quality of this ancient but still important font
format.

If you are going to use variation fonts, please update to
this version since it comes with some important fixes.
More information on this and other changes can be
found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.9/).

#### FreeType 2.8.1

2017-09-16

FreeType 2.8.1 has been released. This is mainly a
maintenance release with one important change: By default,
FreeType now offers high quality LCD-optimized output
without resorting to ClearType techniques of resolution
tripling and filtering. In this method,
called *Harmony*, each color channel is generated
separately after shifting the glyph outline, capitalizing
on the fact that the color grids on LCD panels are shifted
by a third of a pixel. This output is indistinguishable
from ClearType with a light 3-tap filter.

See
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.8.1/)
for a extensive list of changes; noteworthy bug fixes are
correct handling of B/W TrueType hinting and some OpenType
variation font handling issues.

#### FreeType 2.8

2017-05-13

FreeType 2.8 has been released. CFF2 support and
OpenType variation font handling is now complete; the
auto-hinter now understands 25 more scripts, for example
N'Ko and Tifinagh.

See
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.8/)
for a list of changes; noteworthy bug fixes are the
handling of TrueType fonts: unhinted loading didn't work
as expected, and the light auto-hinter used incorrect
metrics.

#### GSoC

2017-02-28

The FreeType project was accepted to be part
of [Google
Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) 2017! Here's [a
link](gsoc.html) to our ideas list – if you have another
one, please write to
our mailing
list so that we can discuss your suggestions,
eventually adding them to the list. And if you want to
participate as a student, now is the time to discuss
everything, again using the mailing list.

#### FreeType 2.7.1

2016-12-30

FreeType 2.7.1 has been released. The most important
news is preliminary support of Adobe's new CFF2 font
format and variation fonts as specified in the new
OpenType specification version 1.8. It also fixes
the handling of raw CID fonts (which might be found in PDF
files)

for a list of changes.

#### FreeType 2.7

2016-09-08

We start a new ‘minor’ series, which finally
allows us to activate a new default mode for bytecode
hinting (see also the announcements below for version
2.6.4 and 2.6.5): Subpixel hinting, also known as
ClearType hinting.

In case you are already using subpixel hinting (for
example, by using the ‘Infinality patches’ as
provided by some GNU/Linux or BSD distributions, or
directly
from [bohoomil.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20161213223431/https%3A//bohoomil.com/)),
be noted that the new mode might provide subtle
differences; the code was simplified to make
it *much* faster. If you are used to the old
full-pixel hinting, you will see many rendering changes.
If you really dislike them, you can disable them at
compile time or using the
new `FREETYPE_PROPERTIES` environment
variable.

A description of the remaining changes can be
found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.7/),
as usual.

#### FreeType 2.6.5

2016-07-12

This release is almost identical to the previous version,
with two differences.

* It compiles again on Mac OS X, and
* it reverts the activation of subpixel hinting by
  default; it will be enabled by default in the
  forthcoming 2.7.x series. Main reason for reverting
  this feature is the principle of least surprise: a
  sudden change in appearance of all fonts (even if the
  rendering improves for almost all recent fonts) should
  not be expected in a new micro version of a
  series.

#### FreeType 2.6.4

2016-07-05

FreeType 2.6.4 has been released. The most important
change is a new bytecode hinting mode for TrueType fonts
that finally activates subpixel hinting (a.k.a. ClearType
hinting) by default.

The new release also brings support for the following new
scripts in the auto-hinter: Armenian, Cherokee, Ethiopic,
Georgian, Gujarati, Gurmukhi, Malayalam, Sinhala, and
Tamil.

See
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.4/)
for a detailed list of changes.

#### FreeType 2.6.3

2016-02-09

FreeType 2.6.3 has been released. It brings support for
four new Asian scripts in the auto-hinter (Khmer, Myanmar,
Kannada, and Bengali), together with other, minor
improvements and bug fixes.

See
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.3/)
for a detailed list of changes.

#### More on the 2.6.2 release for users and developers

2015-11-30

FreeType 2.6.2 ships with three interesting details for
users and developers of rendering libraries that deal with
text. [Read
more](freetype2/docs/hinting/text-rendering-general.html).

#### FreeType 2.6.2

2015-11-28

FreeType 2.6.2 has been released. This is a minor
release that mainly provides better handling of malformed
fonts. All users should upgrade.

A new feature is stem darkening support for the
auto-hinter. Note, however, that it is off by default,
since most graphic systems don't provide correct linear
alpha blending with gamma correction, which is crucial for
a good appearance. For the same reason, stem darkening
for the CFF engine is now off by default, too.

See
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.2/)
for a more detailed list of changes.

#### FreeType 2.6.1

2015-10-04

FreeType 2.6.1 has been released. This is a minor
release that corrects problems with CFF metrics, and that
provides better handling of malformed fonts. Two notably
new features are auto-hinting support for the Lao script
and a simple interface for accessing named instances in GX
TrueType variation fonts.

See
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6.1/)
for a list of changes.

#### FreeType 2.6

2015-06-08

FreeType 2.6 has been released. This is a new major
release that provides a better (and simpler) thread-safety
model. Among other new features we now have auto-hinting
support for Arabic and Thai, together with much improved
handling of Apple's GX TrueType variation font format.

See
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.6/)
for a list of changes.

##### Roadmap

Besides user support and fixing bugs, your money will
help me implement the following issues.

* Setting up a test framework for FreeType. This is a
  huge, long-term undertaking that will ensure both
  stability and reliability of the library. The idea is
  to collect test cases (mainly broken fonts) that cover
  as much source code as possible. Another idea to
  investigate is the development of scripts that can
  generate both valid and invalid input data to
  systematically increase the coverage of executed library
  code, including the unlikely cases. Finally, images of
  valid, well-rendered input fonts could be collected: As
  soon as a change to the rendering image gets applied, a
  comparison run with those images should detect rendering
  regressions.
* Further improvements to the auto-hinter. Right now,
  the module for Indic support is a dummy, and support for
  the family of Arabic scripts is completely
  missing. [FreeType 2.9 comes with
  auto-hinting support for almost all scripts where
  hinting makes sense.] Both investigation and
  research is necessary to find out how much auto-hinting
  is possible and useful, and whether other, completely
  different scripts can be supported at all.
* Right now, rendering Type 1 and CID-keyed fonts
  is the weakest part of FreeType. However, we now have a
  brand-new module for handling CFF. Given that CFF is
  very similar to Type 1, it should be not too
  difficult to use and/or extend the CFF code so that
  Type 1 fonts can be handled,
  too. [This was a GSoC project in
  2017, and the resulting code has been merged into
  FreeType 2.9.]
* Explore whether it makes sense to merge FreeType with
  (parts of)
  the [HarfBuzz](http://harfbuzz.org) library.
  Since version 2.5.3, FreeType already links to HarfBuzz
  to use its abilities for scanning OpenType layout
  features, and more integration might be sensible for
  both libraries.
* More improvements to this website. Last year I’ve
  redesigned the FreeType website. However, a large bunch
  of documents are still using the old design, and some of
  them are also no longer up to
  date. [As with version 2.6.0, the
  FreeType Tutorial has been updated.]

#### FreeType 2.5.3

2014-03-08

FreeType 2.5.3 has been released. All users should
upgrade due to fixed vulnerability in the CFF driver
(CVE-2014-2240).

Its main new feature is much enhanced support of
auto-hinting SFNT fonts (i.e., TrueType and CFF fonts) due
to the use of
the [HarfBuzz](http://harfbuzz.org) library. A
more detailed description of this and other changes can be
found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.3/).

#### FreeType 2.5.2

2013-12-08

FreeType 2.5.2 has been released. It fixes a serious bug
introduced in version 2.5.1; all users should upgrade.

A listing of the changes can be
found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.2/).

#### FreeType 2.5.1

2013-11-25

FreeType 2.5.1 has been released, providing three major
new features.

* Support for the WOFF font format, contributed by
  Behdad Esfahbod.
* The auto-hinter now supports Hebrew, together with
  improved support for Cyrillic and Greek.
* The directory layout of the (installed) FreeType
  header files has been simplified.

Among other changes I want to mention that FreeType's
TrueType debugger (ttdebug) has been made more
versatile. An exhaustive list of changes can be
found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.1/).

#### Pledgie Campaign Was Successful!

2013-06-25

Thanks to a very generous donation by Pierre Arnaud
from [Epsitec](https://www.epsitec.ch), the
pledgie campaign for FreeType has reached its goal. I
want to say thank you again to all donors! Of course,
noone stops you from further donating to the campaign
:-)

After integration of Adobe's CFF module and Google's
color emoji support, I will use the next months to work on
the remaining issues that I've promised to implement.
Stay tuned!

#### FreeType 2.5

2013-06-19

FreeType 2.5 has been released. A major new feature is
support for color embedded bitmaps (eg. color emoji),
contributed by Behdad Esfahbod on behalf of Google.
Additionally, Adobe's CFF engine is now the default, which
makes a good reason to change from the 2.4.x to the 2.5.x
series.

On the technical side, the property API to access
FreeType module parameters (FT\_Property\_Set
and FT\_Property\_Get) is now declared as stable.

As usual,
see [this
file](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.0/) for the complete release notes, which give more
details. And we have again blog entries
from [Adobe](https://blog.typekit.com/2013/06/19/adobe-cff-font-rasterizer-accepted-by-freetype/)
and [Google](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2013/06/youve-got-cff.html).

[Please download the 2.5.0.1 bundle of the FreeType
library, which fixes a packaging error.]

layout, being able to handle OpenType features in
particular. All of them
use [Unicode](https://www.unicode.org) for font
and text encoding.
