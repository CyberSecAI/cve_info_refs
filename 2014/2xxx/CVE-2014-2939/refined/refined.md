Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2939:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper input sanitization in Alfresco Enterprise. There are three distinct XSS vulnerabilities:

1.  **XHTML Upload Vulnerability:** The application does not validate XHTML files for JavaScript code, unlike HTML files. This allows a malicious user to upload an XHTML file containing arbitrary JavaScript.
2.  **HTML Parser Bypass:** The HTML parser used by Alfresco to sanitize input from various fields can be bypassed. The parser treats `<%` tags as JSP/ASP code, which the application considers safe. By escaping input with the `<%` tag, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that evades the application's XSS protections.
3. **Reflected XSS in /share/page/task-edit:** The `taskId` GET parameter in the URL `/share/page/task-edit` is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'):** This vulnerability is present in all three attack vectors described.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** XHTML files are not validated for malicious script content.
*   **Insufficient HTML Parsing/Sanitization:** The HTML parser can be bypassed using `<%` tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser session.
*   This could allow an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, steal session cookies, redirect users, or deface the webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **XHTML Upload:** A remote authenticated attacker uploads a malicious XHTML file to the Alfresco server. When a victim accesses the file through their browser, the embedded JavaScript is executed.
2. **HTML Parser Bypass:** An authenticated attacker crafts a malicious HTML input, including `<%` tags and JavaScript code, into input fields. The malicious script is stored in the application and executed when other users view the page containing the attacker’s malicious input.
3.  **Reflected XSS:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `taskId` parameter of the `/share/page/task-edit` URL. When a victim clicks this link, the embedded JavaScript executes in the victim’s browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XHTML Upload and HTML Parser Bypass:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Alfresco application.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to get the victim to click on the crafted URL.
