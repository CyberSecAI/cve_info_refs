Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2014-2352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Cogent DataHub application improperly handles directory path specifiers, allowing an attacker to include designators that can traverse directory paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The application fails to properly restrict pathnames to a restricted directory, enabling path traversal attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access a limited number of hard-coded files.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Further exploitation can cause the web server component to enter a denial-of-service state.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by manipulating directory specifiers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cogent DataHub server.
*   The attacker does not need authentication.
*   A low skill level is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document states a CVSS v2 base score of 7.8 with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N) for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
*   While no public exploits specifically targeting this directory traversal vulnerability were known at the time of the advisory, the ease of exploitation suggests a high likelihood of potential for exploit.
