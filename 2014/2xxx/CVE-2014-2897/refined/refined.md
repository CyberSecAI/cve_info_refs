Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-2897:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the SSL version 3 HMAC calculation within the wolfSSL CyaSSL library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code does not properly check the padding length during a verify failure in the SSLv3 HMAC calculation. This lack of validation can lead to reading memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** An attacker can trigger an out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to information disclosure or other unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the flawed padding length check in the SSLv3 HMAC calculation during a verify failure.
- This likely involves a crafted TLS handshake or data transmission that triggers the verify failure and out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to initiate a TLS handshake or data transmission with a vulnerable server or client.
- The attacker must have the ability to manipulate the data to trigger the verify failure and out-of-bounds read in the HMAC calculation.

**Affected Versions:**
- CyaSSL versions 2.5.0 through 2.9.0 are affected.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team.
- The vulnerability is related to cryptographic issues (CWE-310).
- This vulnerability was addressed in later versions of CyaSSL/wolfSSL.
