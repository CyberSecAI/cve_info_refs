Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2014-2293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper sanitization of user-supplied input before being passed to the `unserialize()` PHP function. This function is known to be dangerous when used with untrusted data as it can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **PHP Object Injection:** The application is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection. By providing specially crafted serialized PHP objects, attackers can manipulate the application's internal state, execute arbitrary code, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize input from POST parameters and cookies before using them in `unserialize()`, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can craft serialized objects that, when unserialized, could delete arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The most severe impact is the possibility of injecting and executing arbitrary PHP code, giving attackers full control over the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **POST Parameters:** Specifically, the `authentication_method_ser` and `authentication_info_ser` POST parameters within the `index.php` script (when `module` is `users`, `func` is `register`, `csrftoken` is valid, and `registration_info` is set).
*   **HTTP Cookie:** The `zikulaMobileTheme` cookie is also vulnerable, allowing injection via the HTTP `Cookie` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, either directly or through a proxy.
*   **Knowledge of Serialized PHP:** Attackers must be able to generate valid and malicious serialized PHP objects.
*   **For the POST parameter:** A valid CSRF token is required, suggesting the attacker might need to obtain a valid session first.
