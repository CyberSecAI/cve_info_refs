```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Ubiquiti Networks products (UniFi Controller, mFi Controller, and AirVision Controller) lack proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in multiple locations.",
     "Lack of non-predictable nonce in requests"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can force an authenticated administrator to perform actions without their knowledge, including creating new administrator accounts, enabling syslog servers, and modifying various settings.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Malicious hyperlink sent to an authenticated administrator.",
    "Malicious web page visited by authenticated administrator.",
      "Overly permissive crossdomain.xml file on AirVision Controller which allows the attacker to bypass Same-Origin-Policy."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious web page or click a malicious link. The attacker does not need network access to the Ubiquiti device until after the new administrator is created in order to log in with the new credentials."
