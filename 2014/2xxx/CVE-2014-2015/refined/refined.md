Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-2015:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `rlm_pap` module of FreeRADIUS, specifically in how it processes password hashes, particularly SSHA hashes, during PAP authentication.
*   The `normify` function, used to decode password hashes, employs a fixed-size stack buffer (originally 64 bytes). When processing hex or base64 encoded password hashes,  if the decoded hash (especially with a long salt) exceeds this buffer size, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `normify` function copies the decoded hash into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the `radiusd` daemon due to the stack buffer overflow, causing a denial of service.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution (mitigated):** While the primary impact is a crash, there's a theoretical potential for arbitrary code execution. However, the included Red Hat Security Advisory mentions that compiler-level stack protection mechanisms of affected releases will reduce the vulnerability to DoS only.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when FreeRADIUS processes a password hash that, after decoding (hex or base64), exceeds the buffer's capacity within the `normify` function.
*   This can happen if the password hashes are unusually long, particularly when they have long salts in SSHA format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user able to provide a password (or more accurately, a password hash) to the FreeRADIUS server.
*   **Ability to influence password hash:** While the attacker can't directly inject code into the buffer, they must have a way to influence the password hash stored in the user's account. This may be possible:
    *   If the user can directly manipulate their password hash, such as in systems using LDAP backends where the user has write access to the `userPassword` attribute.
    *   If the password data store is compromised, or if the server processes passwords from multiple realms, and a less trusted realm is used.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple hashing methods, including SSHA, SHA, MD5, NT, and LM hashes.
*   The issue was discovered by Pierre Carrier.
*   The fix involves increasing the buffer size from 64 bytes to 256 bytes and using proper size arguments for the decoding functions.
*   The issue affects FreeRADIUS versions 2.x.x and 3.0.x, but not 1.x.
