## Topic

Updated freeradius packages that fix one security issue, several bugs, and
add various enhancements are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the
References section.

## Description

FreeRADIUS is a high-performance and highly configurable free Remote
Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) server, designed to allow
centralized authentication and authorization for a network.

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the FreeRADIUS rlm\_pap
module handled long password hashes. An attacker able to make radiusd
process a malformed password hash could cause the daemon to crash.
(CVE-2014-2015)

The freeradius packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.2.6, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version,
including:

* The number of dictionaries have been updated.
* This update implements several Extensible Authentication Protocol

(EAP) improvements.

* A number of new expansions have been added, including: %{randstr:...},

%{hex:...}, %{sha1:...}, %{base64:...}, %{tobase64:...}, and
%{base64tohex:...}.

* Hexadecimal numbers (0x...) are now supported in %{expr:...} expansions.
* This update adds operator support to the rlm\_python module.
* The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and DHCP relay code have

been finalized.

* This update adds the rlm\_cache module to cache arbitrary attributes.

For a complete list of bug fixes and enhancements provided by this rebase,
see the freeradius changelog linked to in the References section.

(BZ#1078736)

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* The /var/log/radius/radutmp file was configured to rotate at one-month

intervals, even though this was unnecessary. This update removes
/var/log/radius/radutmp from the installed logrotate utility configuration
in the /etc/logrotate.d/radiusd file, and /var/log/radius/radutmp is no
longer rotated. (BZ#904578)

* The radiusd service could not write the output file created by the

raddebug utility. The raddebug utility now sets appropriate ownership to
the output file, allowing radiusd to write the output. (BZ#921563)

* After starting raddebug using the "raddebug -t 0" command, raddebug

exited immediately. A typo in the special case comparison has been fixed,
and raddebug now runs for 11.5 days in this situation. (BZ#921567)

* MS-CHAP authentication failed when the User-Name and MS-CHAP-User-Name

attributes used different encodings, even when the user provided correct
credentials. Now, MS-CHAP authentication properly handles mismatching
character encodings. Authentication with correct credentials no longer
fails in this situation. (BZ#1060319)

* Automatically generated default certificates used the SHA-1 algorithm

message digest, which is considered insecure. The default certificates now
use the more secure SHA-256 algorithm message digest. (BZ#1135439)

* During the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) validation, radiusd

terminated unexpectedly with a segmentation fault after attempting to
access the next update field that was not provided by the OCSP responder.
Now, radiusd does not crash in this situation and instead continues to
complete the OCSP validation. (BZ#1142669)

* Prior to this update, radiusd failed to work with some of the more recent

MikroTIK attributes, because the installed directory.mikrotik file did not
include them. This update adds MikroTIK attributes with IDs up to 22 to
dictionary.mikrotik, and radiusd now works as expected with these
attributes. (BZ#1173388)

Users of freeradius are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
correct these issues and add these enhancements. After installing this
update, the radiusd service will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Hello,

When freeradius verifies a password sent via RLM-PAP against an LDAP
server, some passwords will cause a stack overflow.

Some forms of SSHA, including forms that would be validated by servers
applying standard constraints on the user's password attribute, will
generate lengths over 64 bytes after hex-decoding.

This can lead to such backtraces (observed with
2.1.10+dfsg-3ubuntu0.12.04.1, confirmed to be problematic upstream):
Program terminated with signal 6, Aborted.

On environments where such an issue did not arise previously, a user

# USN-2122-1: FreeRADIUS vulnerabilities

26 February 2014

Several security issues were fixed in FreeRADIUS.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 13.10](/security/notices?release=saucy)
* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [freeradius](/security/cves?package=freeradius) - a high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server

## Details

It was discovered that FreeRADIUS incorrectly handled unix authentication.

A remote user could successfully authenticate with an expired password.

([CVE-2011-4966](/security/CVE-2011-4966))

Pierre Carrier discovered that FreeRADIUS incorrectly handled rlm\_pap

hash processing. An authenticated user could use this issue to cause

FreeRADIUS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected releases should

reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-2015](/security/CVE-2014-2015))

See mods-available/totp.
\* The default minimum TLS version is now TLS 1.2, as per RFC 8996.
Older versions can be allowed by setting tls\_min\_version, and
updating "cipher\_list".
\* Significantly improve the readability and contents of TLS
debug messages.
\* Allow CoA and Disconnect messages over TLS sockets.
Fixes #3356.
\* Automatically set fragment size / MTU, so that PEAP/EAP-TLS
works, and no longer requires manual changes to the configuration.
\* Allow "configurable\_client\_cert=yes" for EAP-TLS. This should
only be used for a "walled garden". See mods-available/eap

is available, and was requested.
\* Include extensions in generated certificates.
\* Ignore user-provided dhparams in FIPS mode.
Patch from Alexander Scheel.
\* Remove native support for Cisco LEAP. It is insecure, and
should not be used. Proxying LEAP is still supported.
\* Allow use of password preparation methods with rlm\_eap\_pwd.
Patch from Michael Braun.
\* Many, many, improvements for DHCP from Nick Porter and Terry Burton.
\* More RFC compliance for various corner cases of DHCP,
\* Use DHCP-specific schemas.

\* Encode / decode NAS-Filter-Rule according to RFC 4849.
Inside of FreeRADIUS, each NAS-Filter-Rule just looks like
a string. But "on the wire", it follows RFC 4849.
See src/tests/unit/rfc4849.txt
\* Allow attributes using old names in configuration files, SQL,
or modules to match attributes in the packet which use

\* TLS can skip the "verify" section if OCSP returns OK.
See raddb/mods-available/eap, "skip\_if\_ocsp\_ok".
\* Set TLS-OCSP-Cert-Valid = yes / no / skipped, which
is the result from the OCSP check.
\* Interoperate with AD and "LmCompatibiltyLevel = 5",
by always setting WBC\_MSV1\_0\_ALLOW\_MSVCHAPV2 for
native winbind in rlm\_mschap.
\* TTLS and PEAP now require "virtual\_server" to be a real server.

See raddb/mods-available/eap, "disable\_tlsv1\_2"
\* Allow password change to work for MS-CHAP. This requires 'r=0',
because password changes are not retries.
\* Fix home server fail-over for home servers using TCP and/or RadSec.
\* Special characters in expanded regexes are now escaped
e.g. User-Name containing '.', and comparing /%{User-Name}/,
the '.' will now be escaped. See src/tests/keywords/regex-escape.
\* Use correct authentication vector when sending Access-Reject replies
for RadSec.
\* Set FreeRADIUS-Proxied-To in TTLS again. You should use the
"inner-tunnel" virtual server, instead of relying on this attribute.

TTLS / EAP-MSCHAPv2 to work. Fixes #1206.
\* Fix off by one error that caused some MSCHAP-Error messages to
be sent without the password change version (V=3) and the textual
message component (M=).
\* Always include C= V= and M= in MSCHAPv2 errors. RFC 2759 does not say
that any of these fields are optional, and not including V= caused
errors with wpa\_supplicant.
\* Do not include M= in MSCHAPv1 errors. It's not supported.
FreeRADIUS 3.0.9 Wed 08 Jul 2015 12:00:00 EDT urgency=medium
Feature improvements
\* Make "pool" configurations more consistent, and
update documentation for them.
\* Move connection pool logic to "most recently started",
instead of MRU. This should help with pool stability.
\* More VSAs for 3GPP2
\* Added examples of multi-value attributes to rlm\_perl.
\* LDAP-Group and SQL-Group attributes are now dynamically
allocated.
\* Only the "sql" module registers SQL-Group. Other instances
register "instance-name-SQL-Group", similarly to "ldap".
\* Unknown attributes are now complained about more often
when used in unlang statements. e.g. if (Foo-Bar == 3)
used to be a string to string comparison. It is now a
parse error.
\* Rename RLM\_COMPONENT\_\* to MOD\_\* in the code.
This makes many things easier.
\* Move to C99 initializers for modules.
\* Load modules in raddb/mods-enabled. This allows attributes
like "LDAP-Group" to be used in the "files" module,
without explicit ordering or listing in "instantiate".
\* Added 'bootstrap' section to modules. Third-party modules
will need to be updated.
\* When adding clients from a DB, add them to a virtual server
if that virtual server has a "listen" section. Otherwise,
add the clients to the global list.
\* When reading dynamic clients from a file, don't expire them
if the underlying file is unchanged.
\* Allow the server to originate CoA requests from the post-auth
stage.
\* The server creates ${run\_dir} and ${logdir} in daemon mode,
if they do not already exist.
\* Add dictionary for Wi-Fi Alliance Hotspot 2.0. The server
now supports all mandatory and optional attributes for this
specification.
\* HUP now re-loads the configuration only if the files have
changed. If all files are unchanged, HUP re-opens the
log file, and does nothing else.
\* Much better debug messages for EAP-TLS, including which
attributes are cached, and when they are retrieved.
\* Increase default max\_requests to 16384. Memory is cheap now.
\* Added "stats memory" commands to radmin. Debug build only.
\* Aptilo controller dictionary updates.
\* SQL modules now use Acct-Unique-Session-Id everywhere.

\* Return better errors when a unix group / user
is not found.
\* Re-enable detail module "locking" parameter.
\* Don't crash when logging replies from Status-Server packets.
\* The couchbase module now uses "update" instead of "map",
for consistent with the rest of the server. See
raddb/mods-available/couchbase
\* Don't require NT-Password for MS-CHAP password changes.
\* Be a bit more careful about decrypting MS-CHAP-MPPE-Key
attributes. Closes #1013. There is no perfect fix, tho.
\* Fix security issues with EAP-PWD.
See http://freeradius.org/security.html#eap-pwd-2015
\* Fix dynamic clients read from SQL in non-debug mode
\* MS-CHAP now allows retries (i.e. password change) when
passwords are expired.
\* Allow "user=radiusd" when the server is already user
"radiusd"
\* suid up/down works on non-Linux systems. This means
that the control socket should have the correct
ownership.
\* Fix issue which caused the server to sometimes have problems
when a home server was marked zombie.
\* Fix format.pl because Perl is now more picky.
\* Fix proxy to Packet-Dst-IP-Address, so that it uses the
correct destination port.
\* Fix corner case with cursor functions and removal.
\* OpenDirectory fixes and documentation.
\* Fix leaks in rlm\_redis.
\* RFC 6929 "evs" attributes are now encoded / decoded
properly.
\* Fix talloc pool leaks when receiving malformed or
retransmitted Accounting/CoA requests.
\* Printed attributes again use double quotes instead of
single quotes.
\* Set X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK\_ALL, and add "check\_all\_crl"
to eap.conf. Fixes oCert CVE-2015-4680.
\* rlm\_expr now errors out correctly on malformed attribute
references instead of triggering an assert.
\* Make "break" work in "foreach" loops
\* Allow dynamic expansions to work again in the "hints" file.
\* Correct minor typos in comments and examples from Alan Buxy.
\* Re-urlencode the path portion of ldapi:// urls before
passing it to ldap\_initialise.

is faster than ntlm\_auth. See raddb/mods-available/mschap.
Patch from Matthew Newton.
\* Recommend /dev/urandom for TLS randomness, instead of
${certdir}/random
\* Allow TLSv1 to be disabled via "disable\_tlsv1" in tls{}.
\* Allow Expanded EAP types where vendor is 0 (IETF) and

EAP types like this are broken.
\* Add support for server side sort controls when searching for
user objects in rlm\_ldap.
Bug fixes
\* Don't complain about "authorize" in "server {}" blocks, but
only if there's no "server" block.
\* Fix cosmetic issue where debug from the first packet read by
a detail reader thread would be emited during config parsing.
\* Fix ASSERT on truncated detail packets.
\* Don't use main server log functions from within panic\_action,
as in the case of syslog this would cause deadlocks if the
fault was triggered from within a malloc.
\* Fix issue in "switch" when "correct\_escapes = false".
Fixes #911.
\* Fix sqlcounter configuration to use "%%b" instead of "%b",
otherwise the new syntax validation will fail.

\* Fix potential SEGV in PostgreSQL driver on error.
\* Fix issue where fields like nas\_type would not be accessible via
the %{client:} xlat, for dynamic clients.
\* Set default busy\_timeout (of 200ms) in the sqlite driver, so writes
don't cause selects to fail in multithreaded mode. This is user
configurable, and may be increased if required.
\* Convert Password-With-Header attributes to binary (from hex or
base64), in the authorize method of rlm\_pap.
\* Fix invalid assert in state.c, that could cause abort in
post-auth.

sections if a coa\_server section is provided.
\* Automatically determine the correct port if no port is
provided for a home server.
\* Allow foreach to operate over lists.
\* Add compile time features to ${feature.\*} and versions
of core libraries to ${version.\*}. Feature and version
names match output of radiud -xv. %v is now deprecated.
\* Add support for PATCH method in rlm\_rest.
\* Validate more module xlats on startup, and warn if an
xlat expansion is found in a double quoted config item
which will not be expanded.
\* Add support for sub-second timeouts in rlm\_rest.
\* Add support for connection timeouts in rlm\_rest.
\* Add %{jsonquote:} xlat to escape strings for insertion
into json documents.

into ldap DNs.
\* Add %{explode:&ref }, splits value of &ref on
 and creates new &ref type attributes with the
fragments.
\* Allow rlm\_ldap to use attribute references for base\_dn and
filter config items. The attribute references are not
escaped, allowing DNs and filters to be created dynamically.
\* Add %{nexttime:[]h|d|w|y} to calculate the number of
seconds before the next  hour(s), day(s), week(s),
or year(s).
\* Allow the left side of update sections to be xlat expansions.
The result of the expansion is then used to reference the
attribute to be modified.
\* Added %{lpad:&Attribute-Name 7 x} and rpad. These produce
fixed-width output strings, with padding to the left (lpad)
or the right (rpad).
\* For some SQL drivers (MySQL, sqlite) distinguish between
constraints violations (on insert), invalid queries, and
server errors, and return noop, invalid, and error respectively.
\* Call SHOW WARNINGS in the MySQL driver and write them to
the request log, if libmysqlclient indicates warnings are
available on the server.
\* Forbid the creation of Vendor-Specific for non-standard
VSAs. Use Attr-26 = 0x... instead.

\* radmin now tracks the return code of commands, and exits
with status "1" if any command failed to execute.
\* radmin now sends error messages from the server to
stderr, instead of to stdout.
\* radmin now looks for sockets matching it's UID and GID,
rather than just always using the first one it finds.
\* radmin can how delete clients which are tied to a listener.
\* Moved RADIUS attribute definitions to src/include/rfc\*.h
\* Move to talloc pools for requests. For in-memory tests
(default config, 'users' file), performance increases by 30%.
\* In rlm\_ldap allow sasl\_mech to be specified for admin and
user binds. Only non-interactive mechs (like EXTERNAL)
are currently supported.
\* Remove support for ephemeral RSA keys. They were "export only",
and should not be used by anyone.

\* Link libfreeradius-radius against OpenSSL too, to avoid
multi-version symbols in SSL libraries.
\* When rlm\_ldap rebinds a connection, it should use bind
credentials from the module that created the connection
pool, not credentials from the module referencing it.
\* Empty server config pairs should be allowed in rlm\_ldap
instances that reference another module's connection pool.
\* Mark rlm\_always as huppable, so its rcode can be changed
via radmin (allows policy toggles).
\* Emit warnings when ignoring user configured pool values.

it appear as if the same connection was being opened
multiple times.
\* Fix threadsafety issues in SQL drivers, where a static
buffer was used to store error messages.
\* Log RERROR, RWARN, RINFO to the global log if request
logging is not enabled.

\* Build with older versions of libcurl, and use CFLAGS from
curl-config.
\* Honour Packet-Src-Port and Packet-Src-IP-address in radclient.
\* Initialise ldapai\_info\_version field, so libldap will report
its vendor and version.
\* Fix log rotation scripts by using the copyrotate option.
\* Fix issue that caused opening control sockets to always
fail on non-Linux systems, if a user or group was set.
\* Save Session-State after proxying.
\* Additional fixes for reading CoA/DM requests from detail
files.

specify a complete object DN and use the base scope.
\* Don't SEGV if a received attribute value in a JSON structure
is null, or a value can't be stringified.
\* Don't assert if the server returns a JSON content-type and
the server hasn't been built with support for JSON.
Closes #808.
\* Set CURLOPT\_NOSIGNAL to prevent curl from handling signals
and causing a longjmp error when the server was running with
threads.
\* Allow tabs after attribute names in the "users" file.
Closes #796.

time, rather than when a packet comes in.
\* Don't call detach on parse error in rlm\_perl. Closes #802.
\* Integer fixes for big-endian systems. Closes #803.
\* Don't optimize %{Packet-Src-IP-Address}. Closes #804.

\* Allow empty strings in "case" statements. Closes #836.
\* Normalize escaping for string expansions. i.e. don't do
double escaping in rare situations.
\* Normalize LDAP escaping. LDAP servers have multiple ways
to escape things, so the data has to be normalized before
we can compare two LDAP DNs.
\* Don't go to high debug level if we're proxying inner EAP
as EAP. Closes #839.
\* Fix rlm\_rest state handling. Closes #835.
FreeRADIUS 3.0.4 Wed 10 Sep 2014 12:00:00 EDT urgency=medium
Feature improvements
\* Home server "response\_window" can now take fractions of a
second. See proxy.conf.
\* radmin now supports "show module status", as thee counterpart
to "set module status"

to prevent issues similar to #634 occuring again.
\* Modify pairparsevalue to deal with embedded NULLs better,
and use the binary versions of attribute values in rlm\_ldap.
\* "ipaddr" will now use v6 if no v4 address is present. You should
use "ipv4addr" or "ipv6addr" to force v4/v6 addresses.
\* The above applies to "listen", "home\_server", and "client" sections.
\* "client" sections will allow "ipaddr = 192.192.0/24". The old
"netmask" is still accepted, but the new format is preferred.
\* Allow custom HTTP headers to be set for rlm\_rest requests using
control:REST-HTTP-Header (attributes consumed after use).
\* Extend format of %{rest:} expansion to allow HTTP method and POST
data to be specified
e.g. %{rest:POST http://example.org/api foo=bar&baz=boink}.
\* Add %{hmacsha1:&data &key} and %{hmacmd5:&data &key} expansions
for signing data in requests.
\* rlm\_cache now consumes its control attributes to make runtime
configuration easier.
\* Add control:Cache-Read-Only which when set to 'yes' will make the
cache module merge existing cache data, but not create new entries.

and urlquoting.
\* Add support for aliases in rlm\_ldap.
\* Add support for connection pool sharing to all modules that use
the connection pool (pool = ).
\* "tls" sections now have a "psk\_query" configuration item, for dynamic
queries to discover a key from a PSK identity.
\* Preliminary support for EAP channel bindings.
\* Foundational work for dynamic home servers. They do not yet work,
but this is now only a matter of updating the "realm" module in
a future release.
\* Support &attr[\*] syntax to copy all instances of an attribute when
used with the += operator in an update section. May be qualified with
a tag.
\* The logintime and expiration modules can now be listed in the
post-auth section. This makes some configurations simpler.
\* Allow comparison of integer attributes of different sizes,
without requiring a cast.
\* rlm\_sqlippool is now IPV6 capable. Set "ipv6 = yes" to get
Framed-IPv6-Prefix returned. The SQL queries have NOT been updated.
Please submit patches.
\* The debian build now checks for the OpenSSL package with the heartbleed
fix, and if found, sets: allow\_vulnerable\_openssl = 'CVE-2014-0160'
\* allow bootstrap from multiple files in sqlite driver.
Bug fixes

mapping, as with rlm\_ldap. Fixes #652
\* Fix corner case in cursor where using fr\_cursor\_next\_by\_da
after calling fr\_cursor\_remove may of resulted in a read of
uninitialised memory.
\* Don't SEGV if all connections to a database server go away.
Fixes #651.
\* Fix issue where  -=  was not removing tagged
instances of  equal to  (only untagged).
\* Fix issue where tag values were not being set on attributes
created with unlang/ldap update blocks.
\* Create rlm\_sqlcounter attributes as integer64 types instead
of integer types, so large counter values can be specified.
\* Fix issue where specifying a dynamic client IP addresss using
FreeRADIUS-Client-IPv6-Prefix or FreeRADIUS-Client-IP-Prefix
may have caused a validation error.
\* Don't print two "&" for messages about attribute or list
references in debug output.
\* Fix urlquote and escape to encode Unicode characters correctly.
\* Fix redundant-load-balance blocks to try other modules in
the group if one fails.

-R response filters, where the requests would still be written
to the PCAP for non matching responses.
\* Define \_\_APPLE\_USE\_RFC\_2292 so that the server builds with IPv6
support on OSX.
\* Fix LDAP group lookups for named rlm\_ldap instances.
Note that attribute references should be used when
checking LDAP-Group attributes. e.g. if (&LDAP-Group == 'foo').
\* Delayed attribute references can now be used in unlang
existence checks. i.e. if (&Attribute-Name) { ... }
\* Fix issues in EAP-PWD. CVE-2014-4731, CVE-2014-4732, and
CVE-2014-4733. There is no external authentication bypass.

clang static analyzer, or cppcheck.
\* rlm\_ldap now supports defining the LDAP attribute name via
backticked expansion (i.e. shell command) in
RADIUS <-> LDAP mappings.
\* rlm\_ldap now supports older style generic attributes.
\* dynamic expansions (e.g. "%{expr:1 + 2}" are now parsed
when the server starts. Syntax errors in the strings
are caught, and a descriptive error is printed.
\* Static regular expressions (e.g. /a\*b/) are now parsed
when the server starts. Syntax errors in the strings
are caught, and a descriptive error is printed.
\* dynamic expansions are cached after being parsed. They are
no longer re-parsed at run-time for every request.
\* regular expressions are now parsed and cached when the server
starts.
\* Added the %{rest:} expansion to rlm\_rest, which will send
a GET request to the URL passed as the format string.
Any body text will be written to the expansion buffer.
\* rlm\_rest now available as a debian package.
\* When an 'if' condition statically evaluates to true/false,
unlang does more static optimization. For examples, see
src/tests/keywords/if-skip
\* All modules are marked as safe for '-C', which lets the
dynamic expansion checks work in more situations.
\* Added 'none' and 'custom' rlm\_rest body types. 'custom'
allows sending of arbitrary expanded text and content-type
headers.
\* Added "config" section to Perl. See mods-available/perl
\* Added '%v' which expands to the server version - Patch
from Alan Buxey.
\* more mis-matched casts are caught in "if" conditions,
and descriptive errors are printed.
\* Support basic response validation in radclient. This allows
administrators to write local test cases for their
site-specific configurations.
\* Removed radconf2xml and radmin "show client config" and
"show home\_server config".
\* Forbid running with vulnerable versions of OpenSSL.
See "allow\_vulnerable\_openssl" in the "security"
subsection of "radiusd.conf"
\* Catch underlying "heartbleed" problem, so that nothing bad
happens even when using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.
\* Add locking API for sql\_null, linelog, and detail modules,
which should improve performance and work around issues
on platforms with bad file locking.
\* Allow DHCP NAKs to be delayed, via setting
reply:FreeRADIUS-Response-Delay = 1
\* Allow tag and array references anywhere attributes
are allowed in "unlang".
\* many enhancements to radsniff, including output
to collectd, ipv6 support and packet loss statistics.
\* Many dictionary updates (ZTE, Brocade, Motorola).
\* rlm\_yubikey now automatically splits passwords from OTP
strings.
\* The detail file reader is now threaded by default.
This should improve performance reading the files.
Bug fixes
\* Fix xlat expression %{attribute[n]} so that it actually
returns the n'th attribute instead of the first one.
\* Don't parse string on RHS of update {} when using unary
operators (!\*). The RHS should always be ignored.
\* Check for more optional functions in json-c so we can
Build with libjson0, which is the name of the json-c package
on debian/ubuntu.
\* Fix issue in radmin where the main dictionaries would
not be loaded which, depending on the configuration, may
have caused validation errors.
\* Fix handling of "%{reply:3GPP-\*}"
\* Fix rlm\_perl garbage attributes
\* Fix oracle SQL queries, which amongst other things still
used the old expansion format, which is no longer
supported/parsed.
\* Truncate long format strings and error markers instead of
omitting them.
\* Fix multiple attribute parsing in rlm\_rest JSON.
\* Don't crash in rlm\_rest if connect\_uri is commented out
in the configuration.
\* Don't double-escape strings to / from Perl. You may need
to double-check your Perl scripts if they use "\" characters.
See mods-available/perl for documentation.
\* Don't re-run "authorize" if a home server fails to respond.
\* Don't append "0x" to hex output of octets types, for xlat
expansions. This is the same as v2, and makes it easier
to concatenate multiple attributes of type "octets"
\* FreeBSD fixes for execinfo linking.
\* Make some of the module configurations more consistent.
\* Fix corner cases where STDOUT wouldn't be closed in
daemon mode.
\* Re-enable "update coa" and originating CoA requests.

\* Fix zombie period calculation. Closes #579
\* Properly parent VPs for talloc, when moving them in map2request.
\* Various fixes for talloc parent / child relationships
\* Allow rlm\_counter to support VSAs.

\* %{Module-Return-Code} works again. Closes #610.
\* Don't increment statistics for Status-Server responses.
Closes #612.
\* A duplicate request isn't a duplicate if the original one
is marked "done". This should lower retransmissions from
clients.
\* Fix multiple regular expression and glob memory leaks.
\* Don't allocate any memory in fr\_fault() as it can cause malloc
to deadlock.
\* Temporarily set dumpable flag before calling system in fr\_fault()
else the debugger may not be able to attach.
\* Set nonblock on all TCP client sockets.
\* Fix minor buffer overrun in mschapv2 where some attribute strings
were not correctly \0 terminated.
\* Fix crash on authentication failure with MIT kerberos.
\* Fix code so that octal escape sequences aren't prematurely unescaped
in rlm\_sql, radclient, preprocess, and other places. This may
require configuration changes, as these sequences will no longer
need double escaping (\\) of the backslash.
\* The connection pools no longer have one connection used twice
in certain rare conditions.
\* Use self pipes for internal signals. The code was there, but was
unused.
\* Don't crash if there are outstanding EAP sessions and were told to
exit gracefully.
\* Fix typo in dictionary.rfc4072
FreeRADIUS 3.0.2 Fri 21 Mar 2014 08:30:00 EDT urgency=medium

including hashes, comparisons, etc.
\* Allow cast (and implicit conversion) of integers to IPv4 addresses
\* More xlats allow attribute references. This means they can
operate on binary data. e.g. expr, base64, md5, sha1.
\* Added more tests.
\* The dictionaries are now auto-loaded. raddb/dictionary
should no longer have $INCLUDE ${prefix}/share/dictionary
\* A "panic\_action" can be set to have the server dump a gdb
log on SEGV or other fatal error. See radiusd.conf
\* Add support for SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512 to rlm\_pap.
\* Add "%{sha256:}" and "%{sha512:}" xlat functions.
\* Cache CUI in EAP session resumption.
\* templates can now have sub-sections, which will be included
in the section referencing the template.
\* Update more dictionaries.
\* Added more instances of the "always" module, for all return
codes.
\* Suppress broken NASes when proxying. Retransmits which occur
more than once per second are rate-limited to once per second.
\* Allow '&' in more xlat expansions.
\* Update PostgreSQL schema and queries to record last updated
time, and accounting interim.
\* Optimize more "if" conditions when the server loads. This will
avoid work at run time. e.g. ("foo" == "bar") --> FALSE.
\* Allow removal of all attributes within a list with !\* operator.
\* Allow list to list copies with request qualifiers (outer.).
\* Add support for ipv4 prefixes and ipv6 addresses and prefixes to
%{integer:}.
\* allow radmin command "set module status  `"
which can be used to forcibly enable/disable modules.
* pap module now assumes Cleartext-Password if Password-With-Header
doesn't have a {...} header.
* Added "unpack" module. It can unpack binary data from horrible
VSA formats. See raddb/mods-available/unpack
* Added example IP Pool for DHCP, using sqlite. From Matthew Newton
See raddb/mods-config/sql/ippool-dhcp/
Bug fixes
* Fix SQL groups.
* Fix operation of fr_strerror() with RE*() macros.
* Don't assert if the connection we're trying to reconnect
is not in_use.

* Fix edge case in pairmove() when some attributes could be over-
written.
* Do checks for individual sqlite v2 functions so rlm_sqlite builds
correctly with more versions of the library.
* In heimdal kerberos, create MEMORY ccaches on a per context basis.
This prevents issues with the root ccache being used.
* Fix corner case with proxying, where home server goes down.

logs when something goes wrong.
* Use /dev/urandom for raddb/certs/random, if it exists.
* Issue WARNING that old-style clients should no longer be used.
* Auto-set secret to "radsec" for tcp+tls home servers.
* Fix double free in home_server_add when there is a parse error
on startup.
* rlm_unix checks if the dictionaries are broken, instead of crashing
* Fix potential memory corruption when normalising salted password
hashes from hex, where the combined hash and salt was > 64 bytes.

* Don't append trailing & to POST options in rlm_rest (minor).
* Process HTTP 100 Continue messages correctly in rlm_rest
* Fix generation of long > 512 byte POST payloads, where attribute
values on the chunk boundary may have been omitted in rlm_rest.
* Remove duplicate escape sequence parsing in rlm_sqlippool and
rlm_sqlcounter which caused issues with escaping %. Escape
sequence parsing is now handled purely by the xlat functions.
* Ensure %% is treated as a string literal, and so not passed to any
xlat escape functions for processing.
* Correct calculation of Message-Authenticator
for CoA packets. Closes #556
FreeRADIUS 3.0.1 Mon 13 Jan 2014 14:30:00 EDT urgency=medium
Feature improvements
* Add "timeout" to exec, and "ntlm_auth_timeout" to mschap.
So that run-away child processes are caught earlier.
* Allow TLS clients to use "proto = tls", in which case
TLS is required. The shared secret is then set to "radsec".
* More documentation in the tls virtual server.
* Add "date" module for date formatting.
See raddb/mods-available/date.
* Added unit test suite for internal server functionality
* When loading "update" sections, check if the RHS is a literal
value. If so, syntax check it immediately.
* Update LDAP module documentation and functionality.
The generic attribute can now update lists.
* Updated dictionary.extreme.
* Update sqlippool to do clears as a separate transaction,
and at most once per second. This should help MySQL.
* Respect control:Response-Packet-Type for all types of
requests.
* Add support for SSL encryption to the MySQL driver.
* Allow arbitrary connection parameters to be used with the
PostgreSQL driver.
* Changes to the OpenLDAP schema to fully expose functionality
of the new LDAP module.
* Update debian packaging to include a freeradius-config
package. This package may be provided as a site local
package to avoid fighting with the preinstalled config
files.
Bug fixes
* Use correct field for ARP setting in DHCP.
* Fix crash on debug condition (#454).
* Fix a number of minor issues caught by the clang
analyzer.
* Set WARNING messages to yellow instead of normal text.
* Correct debug colorise logic. Patch from Phil Mayers.
* Encode attributes of type "ethernet". No one uses them,
but it makes sense.
* Work around regex initialization issues.
* Fix build when linking against OpenSSL.
* Print IDs as positive numbers, which helps for large DHCP
XIDs.
* Fix issue with sql_ippool.
* sqlcounter now uses 64-bit counters, to deal with 4G overflow.
* Fix issues with DHCP subsystem.
* Don't build / install disabled modules, or their config
files.
* Fix build for OSX Mavericks, which hid the header files
in a magical place.
* Fix LEAP buffer issue. You should still avoid LEAP.
* Mark "unknown" WiMAX attributes as being WiMAX.
* Fix typo in packet decoder for fragmented extended attrs
* RPM spec fixes.
* Fix rlm_perl build issues when not using threads.
* Enable %{Response-Packet-Type} again.
* Update configuration file parser to handle "bool"
consistently.
* Update declarations of global boolean variables to use
"bool" consistently. This fixes an issue where some
modules were instantiated in "config check" mode and
did not work correctly.
* Make more messages debug instead of info, to avoid
polluting the logs with messages that can't be fixed.
* Set operator in internal unlang code to suppress spurious
warning messages.
* Fix debian packaging.
* Added "status" to Debian init script.
* Fix "update outer.request" to update the outer request.
* Don't print TLS debugging messages when not in debug mode.
* Correctly manage counters for "limit" sections of TCP / TLS
"listen" sockets.
* Fix libldap debug output.
* Fix rlm_ldap tls functionality.
* Initialise OpenSSL globals early to avoid issues with the
PostgreSQL library.
* Fix typo in sqlcounter expansion code. Fixes #463
* Overwrite previous instances of SQL-User-Name when adding
it to the request.

krb5_copy_context(), which caused segfaults in
multithreaded mode.
* Provide meaningful error messages if Heimdal krb5 is used.
* Fix attribute supression in rlm_detail.
* Exit with error code if child fails to complete server
initialisation after forking. This allows init scripts to
correctly report whether the server started ok.
FreeRADIUS 3.0.0 Mon 7 Oct 2013 15:48:14 EDT urgency=medium
Feature improvements
* Documentation for upgrading from 2.x is in raddb/README.rst
Please follow it. It will make the upgrade easier.
* Moved configuration entries in radiusd.conf to make more sense.
* Added the "integer64" and "ipv4prefix" data types.
* Added RADIUS over TLS (i.e. RadSec). See raddb/sites-available/tls
* Updated internal API to support new attributes and formats
* Added code to send SNMP Traps. See raddb/trigger.conf.
* Added preliminary support for Apple's Grand Central Dispatch
* Added provisions for raddb/dictionary.local, for local changes.
See raddb/dictionary for more details.
* Added packet/s tracking. See max_pps in the "listen" section.
* The %{} expansions and "unlang" conditions are now parsed at server
start. Descriptive errors are produced for syntax and format errors.
* Casting is now supported for "unlang" comparisons. See "man unlang"
e.g. 127.0.0.1 == Framed-IP-Address.
* Direct comparison of attribute references is now supported.
e.g. &Foo == &Bar. This avoids stringification of the attributes.
* Direct assignment of attributes is now supported.
e.g. Foo := &Bar. It also works for "octets" data types.
* Comparisons of IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes are now supported.
The "<" operator means "within the prefix" for comparisons.
* New sha1 xlat expansion (thanks to Alan Buxey)
* Colourised log messages when logging to stdout. Look for yellow
warnings and red errors. Doing this will save you a LOT of grief.
* If the PCRE library is available, use it (insted of the POSIX
functions) to process regular expressions (thanks to Phil Mayers).
* -xv now displays all the features the server was built with, and
the versions of the core libraries (libtalloc, libssl).
Module Changes
* Moved raddb/modules/ to raddb/mods-available/, and raddb/mods-enabled/,
following the examples of other projects.
* Additional files for each module are now in raddb/mods-config/.
See raddb/mods-config/README.rst for documentation.
* Moved "users" to raddb/mods-config/files/authorize
* Moved "hints" and "huntgroups" to raddb/mods-config/preprocess/
* Moved eap.conf to mods-available/eap
* Moved sql.conf to mods-available/sql
* Moved TLS configuration for EAP into a common subsection.
See raddb/mods-available/eap, "tls-config" section.
* Added for MS-CHAP Change Password from Phil Mayers.
See raddb/mods-available/mschap, "passchange" subsection.
* Added EAP-PWD implementation from Dan Harkins
* Added connection pools for modules. This unifies connection
management which was previously different for different modules.
* SQL now uses the connection pool. See mods-available/sql
* SQL now supports arbitrary Acct-Status-Types.
These changes are not compatible with 2.x.
* SQL now has full support for SQLite. See raddb/sql/main/sqlite/
* SQLite supports auto-creation of new databases on server startup for
bootstrapping purposes.
* LDAP now uses the connection pool. The LDAP module has been
completely re-written for performance and simplicity.
* LDAP now caches groups. This makes multiple group checks MUCH
faster.
* Removed all limitations on 253 octet attributes. RFC 6929 allows
for attributes up to 4K in length.
* New rlm_idn module providing an expansion for performing IDNA encoding
of internationalized domain names. Thanks to 'skids'.
* New rlm_yubikey module to validate yubikey OTP tokens.
See raddb/modules/yubikey
Bug fixes
* All known bug fixes from 2.2.x are included.
* Removed "addport" functionality.
* Removed many unused or duplicate modules. See raddb/README.rst.
Internal / API changes:
* All traces of the old build system have been removed.
The new build system is faster and simpler.
* clang is fully supported.
* We now use "talloc" for memory management. A number of new
features required this change. Thanks to the Samba people!
* Many internal APIs have been updated to use talloc.
* New API for iterating over VALUE_PAIRs. This is in preparation
for attributes, in version 3.1.
* No new code should directly modify any field of a VALUE_PAIR.
* VALUE_PAIRs contain pointers to DICT_ATTR instead of containing
attribute and vendor fields. This will allow nested attributes.
* Some protocol specific code has been moved out into proto_* modules.
More will come in subsequent versions. See proto_dhcp and proto_vmps.
* Standardised internal logging macros. radlog() should not be used.
See src/include/log.h
* Use OpenSSL hashing functions when available.
* The server now builds with no warnings on most platforms.
* New RADIUS encoder/decoder, to support new formats.
* Added RFC 6929 "extended attributes", via the new encoder/decoder.
* Added full WiMAX support, via the new encoder/decoder. The old
code could not handle some unusual corner cases.`

  OK.  We've pushed changes to the v2.x.x, v3.0.x, and master branches.
See commit 0d606cfc29a in the v2.x.x branch, and  ff5147c9e5088c7 in v3.0.x.

  The "master" branch doesn't have an official release, so downstream
users don't need to do anything for it.

  Yes.

  And would be discovered pretty quickly.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-19 04:46:48 UTC  ``` Pierre Carrier reported a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in the FreeRADIUS rlm_pap module. An authenticated user could trigger this issue by creating a large password, causing FreeRADIUS to crash. The stack protector and SSP variable re-ordering protections should help prevent this issue from being used to execute arbitrary code.  Upstream fixes: 2.x: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/0d606cfc29a> 3.x: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ff5147c9e5088c7> master: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/f610864d4c8f51d>  References: <http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugbusters/2014-February/000610.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-19 04:50:05 UTC  ```  Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1066763](show_bug.cgi?id=1066763 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-2015 freeradius: stack-based buffer overflow flaw in rlm_pap module [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-24 21:05:34 UTC  ``` This issue was originally reported for SSHA (salted SHA1 hash), which does not use fixed salt string and used base64 encoding.  SSHA password hash is expected to be:   '{SSHA}' + Base64( SHA1( password + salt ) + salt )  The + symbol is used for string concatenation.  This problem is not specific to SSHA or base64.  It affects multiple other hashing methods supported by FreeRadius, including unsalted SHA, salted or unsalted MD5, NT, and LM hash.  FreeRadius tries both hex and base64 decoding for all those formats using normify() function, with hex decoding tried first:  <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/63b21e1/src/modules/rlm_pap/rlm_pap.c#L244>  The function uses a fixed size buffer[] to which decoded password hash value is written.  Upstream fix implements two changes:  - increases buffer[] size form 64 to 256 - correctly passes buffer[] size to fr_hex2bin() function that tries hex decoding  This fix may seem insufficient for FreeRadius 2.x, which uses base64_decode() with no bounds check.  This is a difference from FreeRadius 3.x versions, which use fr_base64_decode() with output buffer size checks.  Even before the patch, fr_base64_decode() was called with buffer size as argument, therefore properly formatted SSHA hash string with long salt could not trigger overflow in FreeRadius 3.x in base64 decoding even before this patch.  Only hex decoding was affected in 3.x.  Upstream fix is sufficient also for 2.x.  buffer[] size increase is sufficient to address the problem, as encoded hash string value is taken from vp->vp_strvalue, where:  - vp is VALUE_PAIR / struct value_pair - vp_strvalue is #define vp_strvalue   data.strvalue - data is VALUE_PAIR_DATA data; - strvalue in VALUE_PAIR_DATA is char strvalue[MAX_STRING_LEN]; - MAX_STRING_LEN  is #define MAX_STRING_LEN 254  <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/63b21e1/src/include/libradius.h#L156> <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/63b21e1/src/include/libradius.h#L77>  Hence inputs to decoding are shorter than the buffer[] with increased size, and decoding process generates shorter output than the input (1/2 in case of hex decoding and 3/4 in case of base64).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-24 22:13:49 UTC  ``` This problem can only be triggered when following conditions are met:  - freeradius has rlm_pap module enabled (enabled in the default configuration) - network devices communicating with radius server use pap authentication - attacker is able to set password hash rather than password  The last condition is typically met in any system using password authentication.  When setting password, user typically provides it in plain and hashing is performed by system or application.  In case of FreeRadius, problematic configurations may be:  - authentication uses LDAP server as backend, where userPassword attribute has self-write acl defined, and users are permitted to connect directly to LDAP.  In such configuration, use may be able to set SSHA password hash with long salt that is still a valid password hash and can be used to authenticate against LDAP.  - radius server is configured to authenticate users from multiple domains (or realms in radius terminology), with not all realms equally trusted.  Server providing passwords for one realm may be able to crash FreeRadius and block authentication for users from other realms.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-25 12:00:02 UTC  ``` This issue affects freeradius packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and freeradius2 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  The freeradius packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are not affected.  They provide FreeRadius version 1.x, which does not support salted SHA1 or MD5 password hashes.  For non-salted hashes, checking is different from what is used in FreeRadius 2.x and later.  Only hashes with expected length are processed.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c10)  John Dennis    2014-02-25 14:51:26 UTC  ``` Re [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8)  "attacker is able to set password hash rather than password"  This is not a requirement to trigger the issue. The normify() function is also called on password value the server looks up in it's backend data store, not just on the password passed in the request. You correctly allude to this in the 2nd to last paragraph discussing LDAP. Thus receiving a password in a request with a long salt is one trigger, another trigger is storing a password with a long salt.  Re [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c9)  It also affects the freeradius-3.0.1 package in RHEL-7, there we need errata for:  RHEL-5 freeradius2 RHEL-6 freeradius RHEL-7 freeradius   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-25 15:42:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Dennis from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c10)) > Re [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8) >  > "attacker is able to set password hash rather than password" >  > This is not a requirement to trigger the issue.

Ok, I see that part of my [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8) was probably unclear.  It was meant to say that attacker who wants to trigger this needs to be able to set long password hash in the password store backend used by FreeRadius.  That implies that password store can feed untrusted / malicious data to FreeRadius server, either by allowing attacker to set such password has in trusted password store, or the whole data store being malicious and controlled by an attacker.  However, this is rather non-standard assumption.  When considering authentication service bypass or DoS issues, password data store would typically be considered a trusted input and issues triggered by malformed password data are more likely to be classified as bugs rather than security issues as they would not cross trust boundary.  For example sshd crash caused by malformed /etc/shadow would probably not be called security, as unprivileged local user can not modify the file to corrupt it.  My examples listing LDAP with users able to directly alter userPassword, or multi-realm configuration (which, however, does not seem typical radius multi-realm setup), were meant to provide examples of use cases where this issue can be considered security.  I do not believe this issue can be triggered by malicious data in a radius request sent to FreeRadius, but only by malicious data from the password store backend.  Please correct me if I'm overlooking some way to trigger this using only malicious password attribute in a request.  > Re [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c9) >  > It also affects the freeradius-3.0.1 package in RHEL-7  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Beta was released with FreeRadius 3.0.  This issue is planned to be corrected before the final release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and hence there will be no erratum for it.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c13)  John Dennis    2014-02-25 17:01:36 UTC  ``` Re [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c11)  Yes, you are correct, this can only be triggered by data stored in the backend data store. My comment concerning normify being applied to the password in the request was incorrect and misleading.  I will note that putting values into the backend data store that can trigger this does not require malicious intent, just ignorance.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2014-06-23 12:46:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of freeradius2 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

My current understanding would be, make any large SSHA password.
Sadly I don't have a testbed. I don't maintain our enterprise
infrastructure and have little prior knowledge of Radius.

rlm_pap.c, mod_authorize, case PW_SSHA_PASSWORD calls normify(request,
vp, 20), which for base64-encoded values will invoke
base64_decode(vp->strvalue, buffer).
Nothing stops this base64_decode invokation from going over the buffer
boundary, a uint8_t[64] on the stack.

So here's a valid SSHA which I believe would trigger this bug, simply
slightly too long for the stack:
$ ruby -rdigest/sha1 -rbase64 -e "pass='a';salt=pass*64;puts
'{SSHA}'+Base64.encode64(Digest::SHA1.digest(pass+salt)+salt).gsub(\$/,'')"
{SSHA}EWVTJscI1wMZviYQ6KV9mluVnTthYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFhYWFh

Increase the salt length (64 bytes here) if need be, eg to a few megabytes.
Apparently the libc on our server has a stack canary, so it crashed
very reliably when a subset of our users tried to authenticate.

Again, with that fix I merely wanted to avoid constant crashes of our
office network, not address the vulnerability :)

Indeed, it is not a remote DoS, and I agree the practical implications
aren't too scary.

But, as a hypothetical, convoluted illustration:
A disgruntled employee could prevent all access to a company's
internal network without out-of-band intervention, including from
remote locations if the Radius infrastructure is centralized.
Such internal network access could be needed to revoke their credentials.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-19 04:46:48 UTC  ``` Pierre Carrier reported a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in the FreeRADIUS rlm_pap module. An authenticated user could trigger this issue by creating a large password, causing FreeRADIUS to crash. The stack protector and SSP variable re-ordering protections should help prevent this issue from being used to execute arbitrary code.  Upstream fixes: 2.x: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/0d606cfc29a> 3.x: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ff5147c9e5088c7> master: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/f610864d4c8f51d>  References: <http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugbusters/2014-February/000610.html>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-19 04:50:05 UTC  ```  Created freeradius tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1066763](show_bug.cgi?id=1066763 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2014-2015 freeradius: stack-based buffer overflow flaw in rlm_pap module [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-24 21:05:34 UTC  ``` This issue was originally reported for SSHA (salted SHA1 hash), which does not use fixed salt string and used base64 encoding.  SSHA password hash is expected to be:   '{SSHA}' + Base64( SHA1( password + salt ) + salt )  The + symbol is used for string concatenation.  This problem is not specific to SSHA or base64.  It affects multiple other hashing methods supported by FreeRadius, including unsalted SHA, salted or unsalted MD5, NT, and LM hash.  FreeRadius tries both hex and base64 decoding for all those formats using normify() function, with hex decoding tried first:  <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/63b21e1/src/modules/rlm_pap/rlm_pap.c#L244>  The function uses a fixed size buffer[] to which decoded password hash value is written.  Upstream fix implements two changes:  - increases buffer[] size form 64 to 256 - correctly passes buffer[] size to fr_hex2bin() function that tries hex decoding  This fix may seem insufficient for FreeRadius 2.x, which uses base64_decode() with no bounds check.  This is a difference from FreeRadius 3.x versions, which use fr_base64_decode() with output buffer size checks.  Even before the patch, fr_base64_decode() was called with buffer size as argument, therefore properly formatted SSHA hash string with long salt could not trigger overflow in FreeRadius 3.x in base64 decoding even before this patch.  Only hex decoding was affected in 3.x.  Upstream fix is sufficient also for 2.x.  buffer[] size increase is sufficient to address the problem, as encoded hash string value is taken from vp->vp_strvalue, where:  - vp is VALUE_PAIR / struct value_pair - vp_strvalue is #define vp_strvalue   data.strvalue - data is VALUE_PAIR_DATA data; - strvalue in VALUE_PAIR_DATA is char strvalue[MAX_STRING_LEN]; - MAX_STRING_LEN  is #define MAX_STRING_LEN 254  <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/63b21e1/src/include/libradius.h#L156> <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/blob/63b21e1/src/include/libradius.h#L77>  Hence inputs to decoding are shorter than the buffer[] with increased size, and decoding process generates shorter output than the input (1/2 in case of hex decoding and 3/4 in case of base64).   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-24 22:13:49 UTC  ``` This problem can only be triggered when following conditions are met:  - freeradius has rlm_pap module enabled (enabled in the default configuration) - network devices communicating with radius server use pap authentication - attacker is able to set password hash rather than password  The last condition is typically met in any system using password authentication.  When setting password, user typically provides it in plain and hashing is performed by system or application.  In case of FreeRadius, problematic configurations may be:  - authentication uses LDAP server as backend, where userPassword attribute has self-write acl defined, and users are permitted to connect directly to LDAP.  In such configuration, use may be able to set SSHA password hash with long salt that is still a valid password hash and can be used to authenticate against LDAP.  - radius server is configured to authenticate users from multiple domains (or realms in radius terminology), with not all realms equally trusted.  Server providing passwords for one realm may be able to crash FreeRadius and block authentication for users from other realms.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-25 12:00:02 UTC  ``` This issue affects freeradius packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and freeradius2 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.  The freeradius packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are not affected.  They provide FreeRadius version 1.x, which does not support salted SHA1 or MD5 password hashes.  For non-salted hashes, checking is different from what is used in FreeRadius 2.x and later.  Only hashes with expected length are processed.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c10)  John Dennis    2014-02-25 14:51:26 UTC  ``` Re [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8)  "attacker is able to set password hash rather than password"  This is not a requirement to trigger the issue. The normify() function is also called on password value the server looks up in it's backend data store, not just on the password passed in the request. You correctly allude to this in the 2nd to last paragraph discussing LDAP. Thus receiving a password in a request with a long salt is one trigger, another trigger is storing a password with a long salt.  Re [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c9)  It also affects the freeradius-3.0.1 package in RHEL-7, there we need errata for:  RHEL-5 freeradius2 RHEL-6 freeradius RHEL-7 freeradius   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2014-02-25 15:42:16 UTC  ``` (In reply to John Dennis from [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c10)) > Re [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8) >  > "attacker is able to set password hash rather than password" >  > This is not a requirement to trigger the issue.

You correctly allude > to this in the 2nd to last paragraph discussing LDAP.

Ok, I see that part of my [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c8) was probably unclear.  It was meant to say that attacker who wants to trigger this needs to be able to set long password hash in the password store backend used by FreeRadius.  That implies that password store can feed untrusted / malicious data to FreeRadius server, either by allowing attacker to set such password has in trusted password store, or the whole data store being malicious and controlled by an attacker.  However, this is rather non-standard assumption.  When considering authentication service bypass or DoS issues, password data store would typically be considered a trusted input and issues triggered by malformed password data are more likely to be classified as bugs rather than security issues as they would not cross trust boundary.  For example sshd crash caused by malformed /etc/shadow would probably not be called security, as unprivileged local user can not modify the file to corrupt it.  My examples listing LDAP with users able to directly alter userPassword, or multi-realm configuration (which, however, does not seem typical radius multi-realm setup), were meant to provide examples of use cases where this issue can be considered security.  I do not believe this issue can be triggered by malicious data in a radius request sent to FreeRadius, but only by malicious data from the password store backend.  Please correct me if I'm overlooking some way to trigger this using only malicious password attribute in a request.  > Re [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c9) >  > It also affects the freeradius-3.0.1 package in RHEL-7  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Beta was released with FreeRadius 3.0.  This issue is planned to be corrected before the final release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and hence there will be no erratum for it.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c13)  John Dennis    2014-02-25 17:01:36 UTC  ``` Re [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c11)  Yes, you are correct, this can only be triggered by data stored in the backend data store. My comment concerning normify being applied to the password in the request was incorrect and misleading.  I will note that putting values into the backend data store that can trigger this does not require malicious intent, just ignorance.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1066761#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2014-06-23 12:46:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects the versions of freeradius2 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c0)  Nikolai Kondrashov    2014-03-20 09:22:14 UTC  ``` FreeRADIUS 2.2.4 was released containing a couple of bugfixes and two minor feature improvements. Configuration compatibility is not affected. We should rebase to save on fix backporting and to reduce customer confusion.  The original release announcement follows. ---:<--- Version 2.2.4 has been released    The changes from 2.2.3 are minor.  Feature improvements  * A "panic_action" can be set to have the server dump a gdb log on SEGV or other fatal error. * allow radmin command "set module status <module> <code>" which can be used to forcibly enable/disable modules.  Bug Fixes  * If the server fails to bind() after fork(), that is now reported to the parent, which exits with an error. * Session / delay times in MySQL are unsigned int. & Use --tag=CC for libtool. Closes #497. Because libtool is too stupid to notice that compiling means compilation. * Fix bug when copying attributes for vendors > 32767 * Fix behaviour on FreeBSD where sending packets from an interface bound to an IP address would fail when the server was built with udpfromto. * Don't fail config check if were listening on an IP which is also a home server. Some deployments have valid reasons to loop packets back to another virtual server. * Use correct port when DHCP relaying. * Set source IP address for DHCP packets from DHCP-Server-IP-Address, or DHCP-DHCP-Server-Identifier, if we're unable to otherwise determine the source IP. --->:---   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c2)  Stefan Paetow    2014-08-28 13:53:36 UTC  ``` This should be updated to 2.2.5 (which is the latest stable for 2.x).  Also, this should be assigned to Nikolay Kondrashov, since he's the new maintainer for the package :-)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2015-07-22 06:16:47 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.  For information on the advisory, and where to find the updated files, follow the link below.  If the solution does not work for you, open a new bug report.  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-1287.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c11)  Nick Lowe    2015-07-26 09:46:40 UTC  ``` There is a high impact bug that will increasingly impact TLS-based EAP users in FreeRADIUS 2.2.6 and 3.0.7, such as 802.1X deployments, when FreeRADIUS is used with a TLS 1.2 capable version of OpenSSL.  This occurs because FreeRADIUS miscalculates the MPPE key meaning that client auth cannot complete when a client negotiates with TLS 1.2.  See: <https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/bdff82cdc5bbd6e9079be4b11f0adc27fa994416>  iOS 9, currently in beta, is an example of a client that uses TLS 1.2 by default for EAP purposes. Users find that they cannot associate to networks that use WPA2-Enterprise.  This bug was resolved with FreeRADIUS 2.2.7 and 3.0.8  I suggest that you consider upgrading this package to 2.2.8. There is a small set of changes between 2.2.6 and 2.2.8. (The 2.2.x branch is now EOL for all but security fixes.)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c12)  Nick Lowe    2015-07-26 18:58:57 UTC  ``` *MPPE keys.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c13)  Nikolai Kondrashov    2015-07-27 09:07:50 UTC  ``` Thank you for a heads-up, Nick! I'll see what we can do.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c14)  Nick Lowe    2015-07-27 09:50:32 UTC  ``` No problem! :) This also affects OS X EL Capitan and the latest version of wpa_supplicant where TLS 1.2 is enabled by default for TLS-based EAP.  The supplicant in Windows 7 and newer support TLS 1.2 for the TLS-based EAP types offered such as EAP-PEAP if the machine is fully patched via Windows Update.  TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are however, for the moment. disabled by default.  See the second More Information section of:  <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2977292>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1078736#c15)  Nick Lowe    2015-07-30 11:40:52 UTC  ``` I've opened: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1248484](show_bug.cgi?id=1248484 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - FreeRADIUS 2.2.6 miscalculates MPPE keys with TLS 1.2")   ``` |  |
