Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2233

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the infoware MapSuite MapAPI. By crafting a specific URL, an attacker can make the server issue HTTP(S) GET requests to arbitrary locations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (CWE-918):** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize the URL provided by the user, which allows an attacker to control the destination of the HTTP(S) requests originating from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Access:** An attacker can access web servers within the targeted network that are not directly accessible from the internet. This allows them to bypass firewalls.
- **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker can read the responses from the internal servers, potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Pivoting:** The ability to access internal resources enables attackers to pivot further into the targeted network, potentially leading to deeper compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted URL:** The attacker crafts a URL targeting the vulnerable MapAPI endpoint. This URL contains a malicious destination, prompting the server to make the request on the attacker's behalf.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any authentication.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable MapAPI to send the malicious URL.
