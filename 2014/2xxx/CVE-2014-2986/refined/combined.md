Both 32- and 64-bit ARM systems are vulnerable from Xen 4.4 onward.

x86 systems are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

None.

NOTE REGARDING LACK OF EMBARGO
==============================

This bug was publicly reported on xen-devel, before it was appreciated
that there was a security problem.

CREDITS
=======

The initial bug was discovered by Thomas Leonard and the security
aspect was diagnosed by Julien Grall.
