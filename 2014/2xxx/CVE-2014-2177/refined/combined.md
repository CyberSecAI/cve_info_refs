| | Cisco Security AdvisoryMultiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers Critical   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20141105-rv  First Published: 2014 November 5 16:00 GMT  Last Updated:  2014 November 20 14:41 GMT  Version 1.1:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuh86998](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh86998)  [CSCuh87126](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh87126)  [CSCuh87145](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh87145)     CVE-2014-2177 CVE-2014-2178 CVE-2014-2179     CWE-20 CWE-264 CWE-352       CVSS Score: [Base 9.4, Temporal 7.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2014-2177 CVE-2014-2178 CVE-2014-2179     CWE-20 CWE-264 CWE-352       Email      Summary  * The Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall are affected by the following vulnerabilities:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThese vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers:   + Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall running firmware prior to 1.0.5.9   + Cisco RV180 VPN Router and Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.14   + Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall running firmware versions prior to 1.0.6.6To check the version of system firmware that is running on the device, log in to the device with the web management interface and click **About** at the upper right corner of the screen. This will open a new window that will display the type of router and the firmware version. The number directly beside the firmware version field label is the system firmware version. An example would be V1.0.3.10.Products Confirmed Not VulnerableNo other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall are easy-to-use, flexible, high-performance devices well suited for small businesses. They deliver highly secure, broadband, wired, and wireless connectivity to multiple offices and remote employees.      **Cisco RV Series Routers Command Injection Vulnerability** A vulnerability in the network diagnostics administration pages of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the devices.  The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with *root* privileges. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh87126](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh87126) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2177.      **Cisco RV Series Routers HTTP Referer Header Vulnerability** A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user who is authenticated to the device to click a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions in the administrative web pages of the device with the privileges of the authenticated user. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh87145](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh87145) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2178.      **Cisco RV Series Routers Insecure File Upload Vulnerability** A vulnerability in the file upload routines of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations on the devices.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to an arbitrary location on the device. This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuh86998](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuh86998) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2014-2179.  Workarounds  * The following mitigations help limit the exposure to these vulnerabilities.      **Disable Remote Management**      **Caution:** Do not disable remote management if you manage the device via the WAN connection. This will result in loss of management connectivity to the device. Disabling this feature prevents Cisco QuickVPN access.      Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can disable it using the **Web Access** screen: **Administration > Management Interface > Web Access**. Check the box for **Disabled** in the **Remote Management** field.      Disabling remote management helps ensure that only users on the LAN could attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities.      **Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses**   If remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of **any**. By accessing the configuration screen (**Administration > Management Interface > Web Access**), an administrator can change the **Remote IP address** field to ensure only devices with the specified IP addresses can access the device.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:/E:/RL:/RC:/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: |
