Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an `unserialize` problem within the Pimcore CMS. This vulnerability is triggered due to a flaw in how the application handles serialized data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core weakness lies in the application's use of `unserialize` on potentially untrusted data. This can lead to the instantiation of arbitrary objects, which may have malicious side effects.
- **Specific Affected Class:** The specific class vulnerable in this CVE is `Zend_Http_Response_Stream`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Unserialize Function:** The attack vector is the use of the PHP `unserialize` function on maliciously crafted data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the unserialize function:** An attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious serialized data that will be processed using the vulnerable unserialize function.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable class:** The attacker needs to craft the serialized data to instantiate the vulnerable `Zend_Http_Response_Stream` class to achieve code execution.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** This CVE specifically targets Pimcore CMS versions 1.4.9 to 2.1.0 inclusive.
- **Distinction from CVE-2014-2921:**  While the underlying cause (unserialize vulnerability) is the same, CVE-2014-2922 differs from CVE-2014-2921 because it exploits a different vulnerable class (`Zend_Http_Response_Stream`) and affects a different (slightly larger) range of versions. CVE-2014-2921 uses `Zend_Pdf_ElementFactory_Proxy`. The range difference is due to code changes in later versions, which prevent the use of `malicious.php\0` filenames, which is a detail of the exploit but not the vulnerability itself.
- The vulnerability depends on whether or not the version enforcement code is present.
