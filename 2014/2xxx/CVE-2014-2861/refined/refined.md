{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the direct accessibility of numerous ColdFusion pages (CFM files) that make up the CommonSpot CMS, combined with insufficient input validation and access control.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-425: Direct Request ('Forced Browsing') - Many individual CFM pages can be accessed directly, bypassing intended usage flows.",
      "CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') -  Improper sanitization of reflected data allows injection of HTML/JavaScript.",
      "CWE-284: Improper Access Control - Many pages can be accessed by anonymous users when they should require authentication.",
      "CWE-285: Improper Authorization - Failure to authorize users before performing potentially dangerous actions.",
      "CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path - Accepting fully-qualified filesystem paths as parameters.",
       "CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') -  Vulnerable to directory traversal attacks via file name parameters.",
      "CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character -  Allows for premature string termination in file paths.",
      "CWE-602: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security - Security restrictions enforced on the client-side JavaScript can be bypassed.",
      "CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type - Allows authenticated users to upload arbitrary ColdFusion pages, enabling code execution.",
      "CWE-472: External Control of Assumed-Immutable Web Parameter - ColdFusion variables can be overridden via HTTP GET requests.",
       "CWE-200: Information Exposure - Sensitive server information disclosure (server name, file paths, SQL server details, admin emails).",
      "CWE-312: Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information - Cleartext storage of credentials in the database.",
      "CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information - Login credentials transmitted in cleartext.",
      "CWE-548: Information Exposure Through Directory Listing - Exposes directory listing functionality.",
      "CWE-532: Information Exposure Through Log Files - Unauthenticated access to log file directory.",
      "CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') - Allows unauthenticated arbitrary command execution."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution on the CommonSpot/ColdFusion server with SYSTEM privileges. Other impacts include information disclosure, credential theft, and other unauthorized actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Direct requests to vulnerable CFM pages via HTTP.",
      "Injection of malicious code via HTTP request parameters (XSS).",
       "Path traversal using specially crafted file path parameters.",
       "Arbitrary file uploads through the application.",
       "Overriding ColdFusion variables via HTTP GET requests.",
       "Exploiting OS command injection through vulnerable pages."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They need the ability to send HTTP requests to the CommonSpot server."
