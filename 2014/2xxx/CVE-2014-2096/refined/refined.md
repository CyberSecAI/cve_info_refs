Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2014-2096:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure way the `catfish` script loads the main application's python script. The script searches for `catfish.py` in the current working directory before falling back to the expected system location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Untrusted Search Path:** The primary weakness is the inclusion of the current working directory in the search path for the main application script. This allows for the execution of a malicious script with the same name.
- **Insecure Script Loading:** The `catfish` script does not sufficiently validate the source or integrity of the `catfish.py` script it intends to load.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can gain privileges by placing a malicious `catfish.py` file in a directory where a user might run the `catfish` application. When the user executes `catfish` from that directory, the attacker's script will be executed with the user's permissions.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `catfish`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Current Working Directory:** The attacker needs to place a malicious `catfish.py` in a directory where the victim user would run the vulnerable application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local access to the target system:** The attacker must have a user account on the system where `catfish` is installed.
- **Ability to write to a directory:** The attacker must be able to create or modify files in a directory where a user may execute `catfish`.

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability affects versions 0.6.0 through 1.0.0 of `catfish`.
-  Multiple CVEs were assigned due to variations in how the vulnerability manifested in different versions, specifically related to the presence of `.py` and `.pyc` files. However, CVE-2014-2096 is specifically associated with the `bin/catfish.py` file located in the current working directory, in versions after a "complete rewrite" of the application (0.6.0 and later).
-  Fedora's build process for catfish has a patch to prevent the loading of `catfish.pyc`, which is why Fedora is not vulnerable to CVE-2014-2094 and CVE-2014-2095.

This vulnerability highlights the importance of carefully managing search paths and validating the source of scripts and executables.
