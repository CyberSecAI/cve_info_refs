- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Acuvim II uses JavaScript to validate passwords, making it susceptible to attacks that display passwords.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Client-side enforcement of server-side security (CWE-602). The vulnerability allows an attacker to display passwords by using JavaScript.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain access to user passwords, which could then be used to change network settings of the AXM-NET module web server. The changed settings can potentially cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit the client-side JavaScript password validation to retrieve and display passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs network access to the affected device and the ability to manipulate the client-side JavaScript. They do not need prior authentication to exploit the password disclosure.
