Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2014-2328:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the presence of shell metacharacters in unspecified vectors within the `lib/graph_export.php` file in Cacti.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary operating system commands due to the improper handling of shell metacharacters. This means that an attacker can inject commands that the server will then execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server where Cacti is installed, with the same privileges as the webserver user.
*   **System Compromise:** This can lead to a full system compromise, allowing attackers to read sensitive information, install malware, or pivot to other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unspecified Vectors:** The exact parameters/input points where the shell metacharacters can be injected are not clearly defined in the CVE description but the vulnerable component is `lib/graph_export.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over the network.
*   **Authentication:**  The CVE description states "remote authenticated users", meaning the attacker needs to be a valid user with login credentials to Cacti in order to exploit this vulnerability.
