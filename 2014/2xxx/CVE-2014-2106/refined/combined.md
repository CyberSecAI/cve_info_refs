| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

To exploit this vulnerability, affected devices must be configured to process SIP messages. Limited Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases are affected.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsCisco devices are affected when they are running affected Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software that are configured to process SIP messages. The following Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software releases are affected by this vulnerability:   + Cisco IOS Software release 15.3(3)M and 15.3(3)M1   + Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.10.0S, 3.10.0aS and 3.10.1S1Recent releases of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software do not process SIP messages by default. Creating a dial peer by issuing the **dial-peer voice** configuration command will start the SIP processes, causing the Cisco IOS device to process SIP messages. In addition, several features within Cisco Unified Communications Manager Express, such as ePhones, will also automatically start the SIP process when they are configured, causing the device to start processing SIP messages. An example of an affected configuration follows: ```   !    dial-peer voice  voip    …   !      ``` In addition to inspecting the Cisco IOS device configuration for a **dial-peer** command that causes the device to process SIP messages, administrators can also use the **show processes | include SIP** command to determine whether Cisco IOS Software is running the processes that handle SIP messages. In the following example, the presence of the process CCSIP\_UDP\_SOCKET or CCSIP\_TCP\_SOCKET indicates that the Cisco IOS device will process SIP messages: ```   Router# show processes | include SIP    149 Mwe 40F48254            4          1    400023108/24000  0 CCSIP_UDP_SOCKET    150 Mwe 40F48034            4          1    400023388/24000  0 CCSIP_TCP_SOCKET   ``` **Note:** Because there are several ways that a device running Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software can start processing SIP messages, it is recommended that the **show processes | include SIP** command be used to determine whether the device is processing SIP messages instead of relying on the presence of specific configuration commands.    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco Unified Communications Manager is not affected by this vulnerability. No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * SIP is a popular signaling protocol that is used to manage voice and video calls across IP networks such as the Internet. SIP is responsible for handling all aspects of call setup and termination. Voice and video are the most popular types of sessions that SIP handles, but the protocol has the flexibility to accommodate other applications that require call setup and termination. SIP call signaling can use UDP port 5060, TCP port 5060, or Transport Layer Security (TLS) on TCP port 5061 as the underlying transport protocol.      A vulnerability in the SIP functionality of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a device reload.      The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of specific SIP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific SIP messages, which may be considered well formed or crafted to the SIP gateway. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a device reload.      This vulnerability is triggered when a device that is running an affected version of Cisco IOS Software or Cisco IOS XE Software processes the specific type of SIP messages. Only traffic destined to the device can trigger the vulnerability; transit SIP traffic is not an exploit vector. This vulnerability can be exploited with SIP over IP version 4 (IPv4) or IP version 6 (IPv6) communications protocol.      **Note:** In cases where SIP is running over TCP transport, a TCP three-way handshake is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCug45898](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCug45898) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only). This vulnerability has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2106  Workarounds  * If the affected Cisco IOS device requires SIP for VoIP services, SIP cannot be disabled, and no workarounds are available. Users are advised to apply mitigation techniques to help limit exposure to the vulnerability. Mitigation consists of allowing only legitimate devices to connect to affected devices. To increase effectiveness, the mitigation must be coupled with anti-spoofing measures on the network edge. This action is required because SIP can use UDP as the transport protocol.      Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document *Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability*, which is available at the following link:   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=32537>Disabling SIP Listening PortsFor devices that do not require SIP to be enabled, the simplest and most effective workaround is to disable SIP processing on the device. Some releases of Cisco IOS Software allow administrators to disable SIP with the following commands: ```   sip-ua no transport udp no transport tcp no transport tcp tls   ``` **Warning:** When applying this workaround to devices that are processing Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) or H.323 calls, the device will not stop SIP processing while active calls are being processed. Under these circumstances, this workaround should be implemented during a maintenance window when active calls can be stopped briefly.      The **show udp connections**, **show tcp brief all**, and **show control-plane host open-ports** commands can be used to confirm that the SIP UDP and TCP ports are closed after applying this workaround.      Depending on the Cisco IOS Software release in use, when SIP is disabled the output from the **show ip sockets** command may still show the SIP ports open, but sending traffic to them will cause the SIP process to display the following message: ```   *Nov 2 11:36:47.691: sip_udp_sock_process_read: SIP UDP Listener is DISABLED   ``` Control Plane PolicingFor devices that need to offer SIP services, it is possible to use Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to block SIP traffic to the device from untrusted sources. Cisco IOS Releases 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T support the CoPP feature. CoPP may be configured on a device to protect the management and control planes to minimize the risk and effectiveness of direct infrastructure attacks by explicitly permitting only authorized traffic sent to infrastructure devices in accordance with existing security policies and configurations. The following example can be adapted to specific network configurations: ```   !- The 192.168.1.0/24 network and the 172.16.1.1 host are trusted.   !- Everything else is not trusted. The following access list is used   !- to determine what traffic needs to be dropped by a control plane   !- policy (the CoPP feature): if the access list matches (permit)   !- then traffic will be dropped and if the access list does not   !- match (deny) then traffic will be processed by the router.   access-list 100 deny udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060   access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5060   access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 5061   access-list 100 deny udp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060   access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5060   access-list 100 deny tcp host 172.16.1.1 any eq 5061   access-list 100 permit udp any any eq 5060   access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5060   access-list 100 permit tcp any any eq 5061   !- Permit (police or drop)/deny (allow) all other Layer3 and Layer4   !- traffic in accordance with existing security policies and   !- configurations for traffic that is authorized to be sent   !- to infrastructure devices.   !- Create a class map for traffic to be policed by   !- the CoPP feature.   class-map match-all drop-sip-class     match access-group 100   !- Create a policy map that will be applied to the   !- control plane of the device.   policy-map control-plane-policy    class drop-sip-class     drop   !- Apply the policy map to the control plane of the   !- device.      control-plane    service-policy input control-plane-policy   ``` **Note:** Because SIP can use UDP as a transport protocol, it is possible to spoof the source address of an IP packet, which may bypass access control lists that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses. Additional information about Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding is at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/unicast-rpf.html>      In the preceding CoPP example, the access control entries that match the potential exploit packets with the **permit** action cause these packets to be discarded by the policy map **drop** function, while packets that match the **deny** action (not shown) are not affected by the policy map **drop** function. Additional information about the configuration and use of the CoPP feature is at <http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/coppwp_gs.html> and <http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gtrtlimt.html>.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.        In February 2014, Cisco announced details of an industry-wide issue with memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. Although the majority of Cisco products that use these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, a device reload or power cycle could expose component failures. While there are no known security implications associated with this issue, a subset of the affected products may experience a memory component failure during the software upgrade process. Cisco recommends customers review the related information and product-specific field notices at [www.cisco.com/go/memory](http://www.cisco.com/go/memory) before making upgrade decisions. Each Field Notice indicates whether the product could experience the memory component failure during a software upgrade. Cisco IOS Software The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) is the quickest method to determine exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The tool allows customers to quickly identify Cisco Security Advisories that impact specific Cisco IOS Software releases. Users can initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from their local system. The tool is also capable of parsing **show version** command output. Results can be customized by searching against all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all the advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication.       Customers can also use the Cisco IOS Software tables below to determine their exposure. Each row corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software release; if a particular release is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the second column. The third column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication.       **Expand to View Detailed Fixed Software Information**      | **Major Release** | **Availability of Repaired Releases** | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected 12.X-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.X based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.0-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 15.0 based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.1-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 15.1 based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.2-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 15.2 based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.3-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | 15.3M | 15.3(3)M2 Vulnerable; migrate to any release in 15.4T | 15.3(3)M2 |   | 15.3S | Not vulnerable Cisco IOS XE devices: Please see [Cisco IOS XE Software Availability](#iosxe) | 15.3(3)S2 Cisco IOS XE devices: Please see [Cisco IOS XE Software Availability](#iosxe) |   | 15.3T | Not vulnerable | 15.3(2)T3 |   | **Affected 15.4-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 15.4 based releases | | |      Cisco IOS XE SoftwareOnly Cisco IOS XE Software release 3.10.0S, 3.10.0aS and 3.10.1S are affected by this vulnerability.
