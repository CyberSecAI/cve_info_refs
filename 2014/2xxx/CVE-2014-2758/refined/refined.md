Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2758:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a memory corruption issue in how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. This improper access to memory can lead to exploitable conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is a memory corruption vulnerability that can be triggered due to improper object handling within the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system with the privileges of the logged-in user.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the vulnerability itself doesn't directly allow privilege escalation, it can be combined with another vulnerability to run code with elevated privileges.
- **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control over the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-based Attacks:** The primary attack vector is through specially crafted webpages. An attacker could host a malicious page designed to exploit this vulnerability, or inject malicious code into compromised websites or websites that accept user-provided content or advertisements.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers would need to convince users to visit the malicious webpage, typically through links in emails or instant messages or by enticing them to open malicious attachments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to host a malicious webpage:** Attackers must control a web server or a compromised website that can host the exploit.
- **Social engineering skills:** Attackers need to convince victims to visit the malicious website.
- **Technical expertise:** Creating the exploit itself requires a deep understanding of the Internet Explorer's memory management and the underlying vulnerability.
