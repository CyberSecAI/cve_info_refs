        "root cause": "The vulnerability stems from the OpenSSH server (sshd) not properly sanitizing wildcard characters in the AcceptEnv directive.",
        "weaknesses": "The primary weakness is the incorrect handling of wildcard characters when validating environment variables, which can cause an intended security policy to be bypassed.",
        "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass environment restrictions, potentially allowing them to export arbitrary environment variables to their SSH session. While this does not directly grant further privileges to the attacker, it could be a stepping stone to other attacks.",

         "content": {
        "root cause": "The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization of wildcard characters within the `AcceptEnv` directive in OpenSSH's configuration.",
        "weaknesses": "The core weakness is the insufficient validation of input, specifically the inability to correctly interpret wildcard patterns. This allows an attacker to craft environment variable names that bypass the intended restrictions.",
        "impact": "A remote attacker can bypass the configured environment variable restrictions imposed by the server's AcceptEnv directive. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information or the ability to influence the server environment. Note that it does not appear to grant direct privilege escalation, but can be leveraged for further attacks.",
