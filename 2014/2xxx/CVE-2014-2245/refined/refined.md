Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw found in the "News" module of CMS Made Simple. Specifically, it lies in the "sortby" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `sortby` parameter, which is then directly used in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker may be able to modify or delete data.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker might be able to craft queries that cause performance issues, leading to a denial of service.
- **Complete compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the database user, the attacker could gain complete access to the database, possibly including the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious crafted HTTP request with a vulnerable `sortby` parameter in the URL when accessing the "News" module functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the CMS Made Simple installation.
- **Understanding of the vulnerable parameter:** Knowledge that the `sortby` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection is needed.
- **Ability to manipulate HTTP requests:** The attacker would need to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with malicious input for the `sortby` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented in CMS Made Simple version 1.11.10, named "Pinzon".
