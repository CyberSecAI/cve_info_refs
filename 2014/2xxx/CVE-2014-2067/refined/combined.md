MITRE may be making a CVE assignment for SECURITY-105, but it won't be
immediate because we need to discuss that one internally within our
team more. This is related to:

  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7285>

not existing yet.

```

The vendor says "SECURITY-76 & SECURITY-88 / CVE-2013-5573" on that
"Jenkins Security Advisory 2014-02-14" page, but the originally
intended scope of CVE-2013-5573 is only the issue involving FORM
elements (aka SECURITY-88), not the issue involving IFRAME elements
(aka SECURITY-76). This may be just a parsing difference. We believe
it's:

   SECURITY-76 & ( SECURITY-88 / CVE-2013-5573 )

not:

   ( SECURITY-76 & SECURITY-88 ) / CVE-2013-5573

The commit that you didn't list is:

  <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/788b7d7a067fad4972fefaaa527141847bfeff55>

The IFRAME issue wasn't part of the original disclosures such as
<http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/30408/> so we normally can't change
the scope of CVE-2013-5573 to include it later.
<https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/SECURITY-76> and
<https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/SECURITY-88> apparently are not
public, and could possibly have clarifying information (e.g., if there
were a later finding that only FORM is exploitable, and IFRAME isn't
actually exploitable). Unless that information becomes available and
suggests a different course of action, we will proceed to assign a new
CVE-2013-#### ID for SECURITY-76 soon.

```

Use CVE-2014-2059.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-106

>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/29351af4bd01f61715418916fc12c52be46bd9b0>

> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-2060.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-93

```

Use CVE-2014-2061.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-89
> | Deleting the user was not invalidating the API token, allowing users to
> | access Jenkins when they shouldn't be allowed to do so.
>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5548b5220cfd496831b5721124189ff18fbb12a3>
>

```

Use CVE-2014-2062.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-80
> | Jenkins UI was vulnerable to click jacking attacks.
>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/16931bd7bf7560e26ef98328b8e95e803d0e90f6>
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-2063.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-79
> | "Jenkins' own user database" was revealing the presence/absence of users
> | when login attempts fail.
>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/fbf96734470caba9364f04e0b77b0bae7293a1ec>
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-2064.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-77
> | Jenkins had a cross-site scripting vulnerability in one of its cookies.
> | If Jenkins is deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to
> | override Jenkins cookies in victim's browser, this vulnerability can be

>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/a0b00508eeb74d7033dc4100eb382df4e8fa72e7>
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-2065. This is an input-validation issue but perhaps
shouldn't be categorized as a standard XSS issue because of the
unusual threat model.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-75
> | Jenkins was vulnerable to session fixation attack. If Jenkins is
> | deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to override Jenkins
> | cookies in victim's browser, this vulnerability can be exploited.
>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/8ac74c350779921598f9d5edfed39dd35de8842a>
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-2066. Again, the unusual threat model might limit the practical
relevance of this.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-74
> | Stored XSS vulnerability. A malicious user of Jenkins with a certain set
> | of permissions can cause Jenkins to store arbitrary HTML fragment.
>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/5d57c855f3147bfc5e7fda9252317b428a700014>
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-2067.

```
> ```
> SECURITY-73
> | Some of the system diagnostic functionalities were checking a lesser
> | permission than it should have. In a very limited circumstances, this
> | can cause an attacker to gain information that he shouldn't have
> | access to.
>
> <https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/commit/0530a6645aac10fec005614211660e98db44b5eb>
>
> ```

```

Use CVE-2014-2068.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2014-02-14

This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.

## Description

### SECURITY-105

In some places, Jenkins XML API uses XStream to deserialize arbitrary content, which is affected by [CVE-2013-7285](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-7285) reported against XStream. This allows malicious users of Jenkins with a limited set of permissions to execute arbitrary code inside the Jenkins controller.

### SECURITY-76 & SECURITY-88 / CVE-2013-5573

Restrictions of HTML tags for user-editable contents are too lax. This allows malicious users of Jenkins to trick other unsuspecting users into providing sensitive information.

### SECURITY-109

Plugging a hole in the earlier fix to SECURITY-55. Under some circimstances, a malicious user of Jenkins can configure job X to trigger another job Y that the user has no access to.

### SECURITY-108

CLI job creation had a directory traversal vulnerability. This allows a malicious user of Jenkins with a limited set of permissions to overwrite files in the Jenkins controller and escalate privileges.

### SECURITY-106

The embedded Winstone servlet container is susceptive to session hijacking attack.

### SECURITY-93

The password input control in the password parameter definition in the Jenkins UI was serving the actual value of the password in HTML, not an encrypted one. If a sensitive value is set as the default value of such a parameter definition, it can be exposed to unintended audience.

### SECURITY-89

Deleting the user was not invalidating the API token, allowing users to access Jenkins when they shouldn’t be allowed to do so.

### SECURITY-80

Jenkins UI was vulnerable to click jacking attacks.

### SECURITY-79

"Jenkins' own user database" was revealing the presence/absence of users when login attempts fail.

### SECURITY-77

Jenkins had a cross-site scripting vulnerability in one of its cookies. If Jenkins is deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to override Jenkins cookies in victim’s browser, this vulnerability can be exploited.

### SECURITY-75

Jenkins was vulnerable to session fixation attack. If Jenkins is deployed in an environment that allows an attacker to override Jenkins cookies in victim’s browser, this vulnerability can be exploited.

### SECURITY-74

Stored XSS vulnerability. A malicious user of Jenkins with a certain set of permissions can cause Jenkins to store arbitrary HTML fragment.

### SECURITY-73

Some of the system diagnostic functionalities were checking a lesser permission than it should have. In a very limited circumstances, this can cause an attacker to gain information that he shouldn’t have access to.

## Severity
