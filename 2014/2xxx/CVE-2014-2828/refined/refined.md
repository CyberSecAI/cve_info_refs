Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the OpenStack Identity service (Keystone) V3 API, where authentication methods can be chained. The "methods" field in the authentication request was not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to include the same authentication method multiple times.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper input sanitization on the "methods" field in the V3 API authentication request. This allows for duplicate authentication methods to be specified.
*   **Inefficient Processing:** The vulnerability causes the same authentication method to be checked repeatedly due to a loop in the code, resulting in unnecessary server load.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a single request containing multiple instances of the same authentication method, an attacker can generate excessive load on the Keystone host. This could lead to a denial-of-service condition, impacting the availability of the identity service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely by sending a crafted authentication request to the Keystone V3 API.
*   **API Abuse:** The vulnerability is exploited through the abuse of the intended functionality of the V3 API authentication chaining mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Keystone service to send the malicious authentication request.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability. They simply need to make a request with the malformed `methods` field.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Keystone versions 2013.1 up to 2013.2.3.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the authentication methods received in requests by removing duplicates.
*   The severity was rated as "High" within the OpenStack project and "Important" by Red Hat.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by commit ef868ad92c00e23a4a5e9eb71e3e0bf5ae2fff0c in the master branch, and commit e364ba5b12de8e4c11bd80bcca903f9615dcfc2e in the stable/havana branch.
*   Red Hat also released a security advisory (RHSA-2014:1688) to address this vulnerability.
