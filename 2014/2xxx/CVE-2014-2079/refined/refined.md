Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2079:

**Root Cause:**

- The X File Explorer (xfe) was not properly using directory masks when creating new files on Samba and NFS shares. Instead of respecting the masks configured by the Samba or NFS server (e.g., Samba's "create mask" option), xfe was using the user's umask for the new file's permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Permissions:** xfe was setting file permissions based on the user's umask, which could be more permissive than intended by the Samba or NFS configuration. This could allow users broader access than intended to new files.
- **Bypassing ACLs:** The issue could bypass access restrictions defined by default ACLs set on directories, giving unprivileged users unintended access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Users could gain read or write access to files they should not be able to access.
- **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data stored in newly created files could be exposed to unauthorized users.
- **Privilege Escalation (potentially):**  In the specific case where xfe is run as root, the created files would be owned by root, but potentially with permissions that allow other users to access them, thus deviating from expected secure behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Creation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user creates a new file using xfe on a Samba or NFS share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **User Access:** An attacker would need to be a user with the ability to create files on a Samba or NFS share using xfe. This includes users who may have limited access to specific areas of the file system.
- **Knowledge of the issue**: Attackers need to be aware of the issue and be able to exploit it by creating files within affected shares, either by using their own umask or by being root on the machine.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

-   **Specific Function Affected:** The vulnerable code was located in the `FilePanel::onCmdNewFile` function within the `FilePanel.cpp` file.
-   **Root User Impact:** The issue was more prominent when running xfe as root, as the user's umask (often more permissive for root) would be applied, while an unprivileged user would use the intended mask.
-   **Patch:** The fix involved removing the code within `FilePanel::onCmdNewFile` responsible for setting the permissions explicitly and rely on the operating system to enforce the correct permissions using the default ACL behavior.
-   **CVE Assignment:** CVE-2014-2079 was assigned to this issue.
-   **Fixed Version**: The issue was fixed in xfe version 1.37-2.
-  **Affected File systems**: Samba and NFS file shares.

The provided information suggests that this is an implementation error, as it is not expected to have "weaker than normal" file restrictions, only when files are created by the root user.
