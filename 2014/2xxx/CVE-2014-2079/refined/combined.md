| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-24 05:32:24 UTC  ``` Robert Rottscholl reported that when creating a new file via X File Explorer (xfe) on a Samba or NFS share, the user's mask was used for the permissions instead of that specified by the Samba or NFS configuration (such as Samba's "create mask" configuration option). This could give users access to files they would otherwise be unable to access.  Patches are available from the original report:  <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=739536>  From brief testing on Fedora with Samba and the "create mask" option, this only presented when running xfe as the root user. The intended mask was used when running xfe as an unprivileged user.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c1)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-24 05:33:32 UTC  ```  Created xfe tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1069067](show_bug.cgi?id=1069067 "CLOSED EOL - xfe: directory masks ignored when creating new files on Samba and NFS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c2)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-24 05:42:10 UTC  ``` CVE request: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/24/2>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c3)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-02-24 12:28:15 UTC  ``` ???  So this just means that root can freely change umask and create files with such umask on samba?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c4)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-02-24 13:31:13 UTC  ``` So this seems to be just saying:  * Program A explicitly tries to set umask as user requested for file   manipulation. Filesystem may partially reject it and may set more restricted   umask, but that is just as such filesystem does so and Program A just   accepts that. Program A then just continue to do following file manipulation.  In my opinion this is valid behavior for Program A. The issue written on this bug is just the "opinion" or "policy" of you and something other than "security issue" IMO.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c5)  Mamoru TASAKA    2014-02-24 14:25:25 UTC  ``` Perhaps I won't change this unless the upstream changes, even if CVE is assigned.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c6)  Murray McAllister    2014-02-26 03:10:31 UTC  ``` (In reply to Mamoru TASAKA from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c5)) > Perhaps I won't change this unless the upstream changes, even if CVE is > assigned.  Thanks for looking at this. I trust your opinion and analysis so I do not mind if you do not fix the bug.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1069066#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-08 02:31:44 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

Package: xfe
Version: 1.32.5-2
Severity: normal
Tags: patch upstream

I'm re-submitting this to upstream and I kindly ask the maintainer to fix
this in stable and re-upload the fixed package.

Lately, I was playing around with ACLs on Samba and NFS shares when I
discoved that the 'File New' dialog always creates files with the mask of
the user (default 0022), instead of applying the rights determined by the
default ACL set on the particular directory (wich is the default behavior
of 'touch'). This is problematic because the admin sets ACLs because he/she
most likely wants to restrict foreign access to this file and the default
behavior of xfe ignores this, giving unpreviliged users read access in
possibly right sensitive areas (e.g. xfe invoked by root and creating a new
file and afterwards adding a private key to it). Furthermore, changing the
default umask can expand the problem to a more severe security impact.

The problem could be reproduced in stable (wheezy), testing (jessie) and
unstable (sid) also with local ACLs. The responsible code is located in
function FilePanel::onCmdNewFile in FilePanel.cpp (lines 2763-2775 in
version 1.32.5-2 [stable]; 2944-2956 in version 1.37-1 [testing, unstable]).

The attached patches fix this vulnerability in all versions by removing
these lines and thus restore the linux default bevahior. Intense testing
of the patched version showed no recurrence of the issue.

Hello Robert,

thanks for this report. It is a pain for me, too, that ACL will be
ignored. I will test your patch and hope upstream agree with this patch.

Have a nice day.

Subject: xfe: directory masks ignored when creating new files on Samba and
NFS
Date: Mon, 24 Feb 2014 16:41:15 +1100
```
Hello,

Robert Rottscholl reported that when creating a new file via X File
Explorer (xfe) on a Samba or NFS share, the user's mask was used for the
permissions instead of that specified by the Samba or NFS configuration.
Full details and patches are available from the following:

<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=739536>

From brief testing on Fedora with Samba and the "create mask" smb.conf
option, this issue only presented when running xfe as the root user. The
intended mask was used when running xfe as an unprivileged user. I don't
the equivalent NFS option.

Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already?

Thanks,

This seems to be an implementation error. It seems extremely unlikely
that this type of product would want to provide "weaker than normal"
file restrictions only in the special case of files created by root.

Use [CVE-2014-2079](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2079).

This seems to be an implementation error. It seems extremely unlikely
that this type of product would want to provide "weaker than normal"
file restrictions only in the special case of files created by root.

Use CVE-2014-2079.
