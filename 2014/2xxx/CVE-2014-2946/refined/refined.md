  "CVE-2014-2946": {
    "match": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Huawei E303's web interface is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). Specifically, the `/api/sms/send-sms` endpoint does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to send SMS messages without the user's consent or knowledge.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
        "Direct request vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can force a user's Huawei E303 device to silently send SMS messages to attacker-specified recipients, potentially incurring charges to the user's account. The user has no way to prevent or cancel these actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted HTML web page, embedded on any website, can be used to exploit this vulnerability. When a user with a Huawei E303 modem visits this page, the malicious code can send HTTP POST requests with XML in the body to the device's `/api/sms/send-sms` endpoint.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a web page containing the malicious code and trick the victim into visiting that page while the victim's computer is connected to the internet and has the Huawei E303 device connected. The attacker doesn't require any prior access to the victim's local network."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is not a duplicate of VU#341526 (CVE-2013-6031), which requires the attacker to be on the same WLAN/WiFi network as the device. This vulnerability can be exploited over the internet. The device's Web UI communicates with the vulnerable module by sending and receiving XML requests via XmlHttpRequest. However, the vulnerable module can also be accessed and controlled by sending an HTTP-POST request with XML in the request's body."
