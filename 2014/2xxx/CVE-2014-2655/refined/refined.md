Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2014-2655:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `list-virtual.php` file of PostfixAdmin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code in `list-virtual.php` does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Database Manipulation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform arbitrary manipulations to the PostfixAdmin database. This could include:
    *   Data Breaches: Reading sensitive information stored in the database (e.g., email addresses, passwords, etc.)
    *   Data Modification: Modifying existing data within the database.
    *   Data Deletion: Removing important data, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Through the Web Interface:** The vulnerable `list-virtual.php` file is accessed via the web interface of PostfixAdmin.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the creation of new aliases, which are then processed by the vulnerable `list-virtual.php` when displaying a list.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of PostfixAdmin with the privilege to create new aliases. This significantly limits the exploit to those with valid accounts.
