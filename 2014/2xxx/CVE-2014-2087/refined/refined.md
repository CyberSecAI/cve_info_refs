{
  "CVE-2014-2087": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application parses download requests and adds them to a download queue. When removing an item from the queue, the application doesn't properly validate the length of the complete download queue object. Specifically, the `CDownloads_Deleted::UpdateDownload` function concatenates the filename and the full URL of the download, which can lead to a stack-based buffer overflow if the combined length exceeds a predefined buffer size (10000 bytes).",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121)",
      "Insecure use of strcat() or lstrcat()",
      "Lack of proper input validation of download queue object lengths"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution with the privileges of the user running the application. Failed exploits may cause a denial-of-service condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By controlling the target HTTP server, an attacker can send arbitrary long filename values via HTTP 301 redirects.",
      "Locally, via \"File->Import->Import list of downloads\""
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have control over a web server or the local machine where Free Download Manager is running."
