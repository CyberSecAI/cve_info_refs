{
  "CVE-2014-2684": {
    "description": "The `Consumer` component of `ZendOpenId` allows logging in with an arbitrary OpenID account by using a malicious OpenID provider. It is possible to impersonate any OpenID Identity against the framework. This occurs because the framework does not properly verify the source of OpenID tokens.",
    "root_cause": "The `verify()` method of the consumer does not properly validate the source of the OpenID token, allowing an attacker to use a malicious OpenID provider to generate valid tokens with arbitrary `openid.identifier` and `openid.claimed_id` values.",
     "vulnerabilities": [
        "Insecure verification of OpenID tokens",
        "Insufficient checks on signed parameters",
        "Lack of validation of the token's origin",
         "Improper handling of the `openid_op_endpoint` value"
      ],
    "impact": "An attacker can impersonate any user by logging in with an arbitrary OpenID identity, without knowing any credentials or secrets.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious OpenID Provider is set up to generate valid OpenID tokens with arbitrary identities. The malicious provider then ignores the originally requested identity and uses the victim's identity when responding to the framework's request.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control an OpenID Provider and be able to generate valid OpenID tokens. They also need to initiate a login attempt against a system using the vulnerable ZendOpenId consumer."
