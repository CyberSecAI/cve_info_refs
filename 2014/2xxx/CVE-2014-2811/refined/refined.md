  "CVE-2014-2811": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "docs.microsoft.com_dfb986bb_20250125_204436.html",
      "Title": "Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-051 - Critical",
       "Version": "1.4",
      "Publish Date": "August 12, 2014",
      "Update Date": "June 17, 2015"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer improperly accesses objects in memory, leading to memory corruption.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Memory Corruption"
      ],
        "Impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user, potentially gaining the same user rights. This could lead to complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative privileges. An attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Web-based attack",
        "Compromised websites",
        "Websites hosting user-provided content or advertisements."
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": "An attacker needs to convince a user to view a specially crafted webpage using Internet Explorer. This could be achieved by tricking the user into clicking a link in an email or instant messenger, or by opening a malicious attachment."
    },
    "Affected Software": {
        "Affected Versions": [
          "Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 1",
          "Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1",
           "Internet Explorer 11 on Windows Server 2008 R2 for x64-based Systems Service Pack 1",
          "Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1 for 32-bit Systems",
          "Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems",
          "Internet Explorer 11 on Windows Server 2012 R2",
          "Internet Explorer 11 on Windows RT 8.1"
        ],
         "Severity": {
           "Windows Clients": "Critical / RCE",
            "Windows Servers": "Moderate / RCE"
          }
      },
    "Mitigations": {
      "Mitigating Factors": [
        "Attackers cannot force users to view malicious content; they must convince users to take action.",
        "Users with fewer user rights on the system are less impacted than those with administrative rights.",
         "Enhanced Security Configuration in Windows Server mitigates these vulnerabilities."
      ],
      "Workarounds": [
        "Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone.",
         "Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to 'High' to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting."
      ]
    },
    "Additional Information": {
       "Patch Information": "The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.",
        "Public Disclosure": "No",
        "Exploitation": "No"
    }
  }
