    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2014-2246",
      "description": "The integrated web server (port 80/tcp and port 443/tcp) of the affected device might be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.",
      "root_cause": "The integrated web server of the affected SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU family devices does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it on a web page.",
      "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the web page, or the execution of arbitrary code on the user's machine.",
       "attack_vector": "The attacker would need to inject malicious code into the web server through a method that allows them to alter the content rendered by the web server (e.g., through input fields or parameters in the URL).",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have some means of injecting the malicious script through user input or other channels into the vulnerable web application. This would likely require a user to interact with a malicious link or access a compromised webpage."
