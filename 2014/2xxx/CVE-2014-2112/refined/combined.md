| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 6.4 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 6.4 |

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS Software SSL VPN Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20140326-ios-sslvpn  First Published: 2014 March 26 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  [See below](#workarounds)   Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuf51357](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf51357)     CVE-2014-2112     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8, Temporal 6.4](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C       CVE-2014-2112     CWE-399       [Download OVAL](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/contentxml/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20140326-ios-sslvpn/oval/cisco-sa-20140326-ios-sslvpn_482.xml)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN subsystem of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsOnly devices that have been configured for the WebVPN Enhancements feature (Cisco IOS SSLVPN) are affected by this vulnerability.      To determine whether a device is enabled for WebVPN, the preferred method is to issue the **show webvpn gateway** EXEC command. A device is affected if it is running the vulnerable software and the configuration lists the *Admin* and *Operation* statuses of any configured gateway as *up*.      In the following example, the device has a single WebVPN gateway configured called *ssl-vpn*. The gateway is up and accepting connections ```   Router#show webvpn gateway      Gateway Name                       Admin  Operation------------                       -----  ---------ssl-vpn                            up     up   ``` Administrators may also perform a configuration check by issuing the following EXEC commands, **show running-config | include webvpn**. If the device returns any output this means that SSLVPN is configured on the device and the device may be vulnerable. If the output from **show running-config | include webvpn** contains *webvpn gateway ,* then the device is configured to support the Cisco IOS SSLVPN feature. A device is vulnerable if it has the *inservice* command in at least one of the *webvpn gateway* sections. The following example shows a vulnerable device configured with Cisco IOS SSLVPN: ```   Router# show running-config | include webvpn           webvpn gateway ssl-vpn ip address 10.1.1.1 port 443   ssl trustpoint Gateway-TP inservice !Router#   ``` A device that supports the Cisco IOS SSLVPN is not vulnerable if it does not have a WebVPN gateway configured or all the configured WebVPN gateway entries contain the *no inservice* sub-command within the webvpn gateway section.    To determine the Cisco IOS Software release that is running on a Cisco product, administrators can log in to the device and issue the **show version** command to display the system banner. The system banner confirms that the device is running Cisco IOS Software by displaying text similar to "Cisco Internetwork Operating System Software" or "Cisco IOS Software." The image name displays in parentheses, followed by "Version" and the Cisco IOS Software release name. Other Cisco devices do not have the **show version** command or may provide different output.  The following example identifies a Cisco product that is running Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)M5 with an installed image name of C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M:  ```   Router> show version Cisco IOS Software, C3900 Software (C3900-UNIVERSALK9-M), 15.2(4)M5, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)Technical Support: http://www.cisco.com/techsupportCopyright (c) 1986-2013 by Cisco Systems, Inc.Compiled Fri 13-Sep-13 16:44 by prod_rel_team   ```   ```   !--- output truncated    ```  Additional information about Cisco IOS Software release naming conventions is available in [White Paper: Cisco IOS and NX-OS Software Reference Guide](http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/ios-ref.html). Products Confirmed Not VulnerableCisco IOS XE Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco IOS XR Software is not affected by this vulnerability.      Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliance is not affected by this vulnerability.      No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Details  * Cisco IOS SSL VPN Denial of Service VulnerabilityA vulnerability in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN subsystem of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.      The vulnerability is due to a failure to process certain types of HTTP requests. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker could submit crafted requests designed to consume memory to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to consume and fragment memory on the affected device. This may cause reduced performance, a failure of certain processes, or a restart of the affected device.      A three-way TCP handshake must be completed for each malicious connection to an affected device; however, authentication is not required. The default TCP port number for SSLVPN is 443.      This vulnerability is documented in Cisco bug ID [CSCuf51357](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuf51357) ([registered](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.comRPF/register/register.do) customers only) and has been assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) ID CVE-2014-2112.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds for the vulnerability described in this Cisco Security Advisory.  Fixed Software  * When considering software upgrades, customers are advised to consult the Cisco Security Advisories, Responses, and Notices archive at <http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt> and review subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.      In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.        In February 2014, Cisco announced details of an industry-wide issue with memory components manufactured by a single supplier between 2005 and 2010. Although the majority of Cisco products that use these components are experiencing field failure rates below expected levels, a device reload or power cycle could expose component failures. While there are no known security implications associated with this issue, a subset of the affected products may experience a memory component failure during the software upgrade process. Cisco recommends customers review the related information and product-specific field notices at [www.cisco.com/go/memory](http://www.cisco.com/go/memory) before making upgrade decisions. Each Field Notice indicates whether the product could experience the memory component failure during a software upgrade. Cisco IOS Software The [Cisco IOS Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/selectIOSVersion.x) is the quickest method to determine exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. The tool allows customers to quickly identify Cisco Security Advisories that impact specific Cisco IOS Software releases. Users can initiate a search by selecting releases from the drop-down menu or uploading a file from their local system. The tool is also capable of parsing **show version** command output. Results can be customized by searching against all previously published Cisco Security Advisories, a specific publication, or all the advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication.       Customers can also use the Cisco IOS Software tables below to determine their exposure. Each row corresponds to a Cisco IOS Software release; if a particular release is vulnerable, the earliest releases that contain the fix are listed in the second column. The third column lists the earliest possible releases that correct all vulnerabilities in this Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication.                      **Expand to View Detailed Fixed Software Information**      | **Major Release** | **Availability of Repaired Releases** | |   | --- | --- | --- |   | **Affected 12.0-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.0 based releases | | |   | **Affected 12.2-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.2-based releases | | |   | **Affected 12.3-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.3 based releases | | |   | **Affected 12.4-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 12.4 based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.0-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | There are no affected 15.0 based releases | | |   | **Affected 15.1-Based Releases** | **First Fixed Release** | **First Fixed Release for All Advisories in the March 2014 Bundled Publication** |   | 15.1EY | Not vulnerable | Vulnerable;
