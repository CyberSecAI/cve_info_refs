Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2128:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of authentication cookies within the SSL VPN code of Cisco ASA software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary issue is an authentication bypass vulnerability. The system fails to properly validate authentication cookies, which can be forged or manipulated by an attacker.
*   **Improper Cookie Handling:** The vulnerability specifically arises from how the software manages authentication cookies when the SSL VPN feature is enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can gain unauthenticated access to the SSL VPN portal web page.
*   **VPN Tunnel Initiation:** Depending on the specific SSL VPN configuration, the attacker may be able to establish a VPN tunnel using Cisco AnyConnect, potentially gaining unauthorized access to internal network resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manual HTTP POST Modification:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by manually altering the HTTP POST body to include a forged cookie value.
*   **Crafted URL:** Attackers can also exploit the flaw by crafting and submitting specific URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can be remote.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Cisco ASA device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have valid credentials initially since the vulnerability allows bypassing authentication.
*   **Knowledge of HTTP:** The attacker needs some knowledge of crafting or manipulating HTTP requests, specifically POST requests and cookies, or URLs.

**Affected Products:**
*   Cisco ASA Software versions prior to 8.2(5.47)
*   Cisco ASA Software versions prior to 8.3(2.40)
*   Cisco ASA Software versions prior to 8.4(7.3)
*   Cisco ASA Software versions prior to 8.6(1.13)
*   Cisco ASA Software versions prior to 9.0(3.8)
*   Cisco ASA Software versions prior to 9.1(3.2)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco ASA Software configured in routed firewall mode and single context mode.
*   It can be triggered by IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.
*   A TCP three-way handshake is required for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability is related to Cisco bug ID CSCua85555.
