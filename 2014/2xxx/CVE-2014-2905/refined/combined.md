Subject: Upcoming security release of fish 2.1.1

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

fish (the friendly interactive shell) is a smart and user-friendly command
line shell for OS X, Linux, and the rest of the family.

fish 2.1.1 will be released shortly, correcting two security vulnerabilities
and reducing the scope of a further security vulnerability.

fish 2.1.1 will be made available as source and binary packages at
<http://fishshell.com/>.

The following security vulnerabilities have been identified in the fish shell:

CVE-2014-2905: fish universal variable socket vulnerable to permission bypass
leading to privilege escalation

  fish, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), does not
  check the credentials of processes communicating over the fishd universal
  variable server UNIX domain socket. This allows a local attacker to elevate
  their privileges to those of a target user running fish, including root.

  fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.

  No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.

  <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1436>

CVE-2014-2906: fish temporary file creation vulnerable to race condition
leading to privilege escalation

  fish, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), creates
  temporary files in an insecure manner.

  Versions 1.23.0 to 2.1.0 (inclusive) execute code from these temporary files,
  allowing privilege escalation to those of any user running fish, including
  root.

  Additionally, from at least version 1.16.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive),
  fish will read data using the psub function from these temporary files,
  meaning that the input of commands used with the psub function is under the
  control of the attacker.

  fish version 2.1.1 is not vulnerable.

  No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish.

  <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1437>

CVE-2014-2914: fish web interface does not restrict access leading to remote
code execution

  fish, from version 2.0.0 to version 2.1.0 (inclusive), fails to restrict
  connections to the Web-based configuration service (fish_config). This
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the user
  running fish_config.

  The service is generally only running for short periods of time.

  fish version 2.1.1 restricts incoming connections to localhost only. At this
  stage, users should avoid running fish_config on systems where there are
  untrusted local users, as they are still able to connect to the fish_config
  service and elevate their privileges to those of the user running
  fish_config.

  No workaround is currently available for earlier versions of fish, although
  the use of the fish_config tool is optional as other interfaces to fish
  configuration are available.

  <https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1438>

The patches going into 2.1.1 can be retrieved from the Integration_2.1.1 branch
on Github if you would like to patch your own source or packages without
updating to 2.1.1:
<https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/tree/Integration_2.1.1>
  10642a34f17ae45bd93be3ae6021ee920d3da0c2
  8412c867a501e3a68e55fef6215e86d3ac9f617b
  c0989dce2d882c94eb3183e7b94402ba53534abb

Although at this stage we won't be issuing a 2.0.1 release, the patches have
been backported to the 2.0.0 branch for distributions that would prefer not to
upgrade to the 2.1 series:
