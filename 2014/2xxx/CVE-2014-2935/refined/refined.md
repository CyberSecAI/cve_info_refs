- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection (CWE-78).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted PHP XMLRPC request to the vulnerable `/costview3/xmlrpc_server/xmlrpc.php` script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated remote user can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
