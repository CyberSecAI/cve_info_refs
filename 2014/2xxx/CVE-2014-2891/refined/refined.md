Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A NULL-pointer dereference in the ASN.1 parser within strongSwan. This occurs when parsing a crafted ID\_DER\_ASN1\_DN ID payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The vulnerability is specifically a NULL pointer dereference. When parsing certain crafted ID payloads, the code attempts to access a memory location through a NULL pointer, which leads to a crash.
*   **Crafted ID Payloads:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted `ID_DER_ASN1_DN` ID payload. The specific byte sequence that triggers this is a two-byte payload where the second byte has a value between `0x81` and `0x84` (or `0x88` depending on `sizeof(size_t)`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a crash of the IKE daemon (pluto or charon), causing a denial of service.
*   **No Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability does not allow for remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted IKE payload over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely by sending the malicious IKE payload.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send IKE packets to the vulnerable strongSwan instance.

**Affected Versions:**

*   strongSwan versions 4.3.3 up to 5.1.1 are vulnerable.
*   Fixed in strongSwan version 5.1.2 and later.
*   Specific versions mentioned in the advisories are:
    *   Debian: Fixed in version 4.4.1-5.6 (squeeze), 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u4 (wheezy), 5.1.2-1 (jessie, sid)
    *   openSUSE: Patched in updates for 11.4, 12.3 and 13.1

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the logging or comparing of the identity from the crafted payload.
*   The specific byte sequence triggering the crash is a two-byte payload where the second byte is between 0x81 and 0x84 (or 0x88 depending on sizeof(size_t)).
*   A patch is available for older releases that are affected.
