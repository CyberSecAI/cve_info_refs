**CVE ID:** CVE-2014-2995 - **UNRELATED** (The provided content references CVE-2014-2559, not CVE-2014-2995)

**Vulnerability Details (Based on CVE-2014-2559)**

*   **Root Cause:** The Twitget WordPress plugin version 3.3.1 is vulnerable to both Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **CSRF:** A logged-in administrator can be tricked into unknowingly updating plugin options through a specially crafted page.
    *   **XSS:** Some of these updated options are then output without proper escaping, leading to XSS vulnerabilities. Specifically, the XSS occurs in `twitget.php` at line 755, whereas the nonce check should occur around line 661 of the same file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSRF:** Lack of proper CSRF protection allows an attacker to modify plugin settings on behalf of a logged-in administrator.
    *   **XSS:** Insufficient sanitization/escaping of user-controlled input when displaying plugin settings in the admin panel leads to XSS.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **CSRF:** An attacker can modify the Twitget plugin settings, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities within the WordPress site if they can set a vulnerable option.
    *   **XSS:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the administrator's browser session, which can be used to perform further malicious actions such as stealing cookies, hijacking admin sessions, or defacing the site.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a malicious web page that includes a form that targets the vulnerable plugin options page.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting that page (e.g., via a phishing link or an iframe on a malicious site).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a way to get a logged-in administrator to visit a specially crafted web page under their control.
    *   The attacker does not need any prior authentication on the target website.
* **Proof of Concept**
    ```html
    <form action="http://localhost/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=twitget/twitget.php" method="POST">
      <input type="text" name="twitget_username" value="john_smith">
      <input type="text" name="twitget_consumer_key" value="&quot;>&lt;script>alert('dxw')&lt;/script>">
      <input type="submit">
    </form>
    ```
    This HTML form demonstrates how an attacker can craft a malicious request to exploit the vulnerability. This form, when submitted by a logged-in admin will change the plugin settings, and the injected javascript will be executed upon the page reload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2013-07-30 and reported to plugins@wordpress.org on 2014-03-18.
