### [A good plugin, but could use some additional features](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-good-plugin-but-could-use-some-additional-features/)

I know the purpose of this plugin is its simplicity. However, for large organizations that have multiple Twitter accounts they want to feature on their website, its lack of support can be frustrating. It forces you to choose either a different plugin altogether or which Twitter account is the most important. A 5-star rating from me would need the plugin to support multiple Twitter accounts.

I love the fact that I can embed my latest tweets both either as a shortcode or as a widget. Everything is working from my initial tests thus far.
Keep up the good work!
