This is somewhat complex in the sense that all of the issues are
within the scope of CVE but the disclosures only marginally have
enough information to determine the correct number of CVE IDs. We did
not want to combine independent discoveries into the same CVE ID.

<http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-01>

CVE-2014-2681 - This CVE is for the lack of protection against XML
External Entity injection attacks in some functions, because of the
incomplete fix in CVE-2012-5657. It appears that this only affects
Zend Framework 1.x, although that isn't critical to determining the
number of CVE IDs.

CVE-2014-2682 - This CVE is for the failure to consider that the
libxml_disable_entity_loader setting is shared among threads in the
PHP-FPM case. Again, the existence of this CVE means that the
CVE-2012-5657 fix was incomplete. It appears that this affects more
than just Zend Framework 1.x, although that isn't critical to
determining the number of CVE IDs.

CVE-2014-2683 - This CVE is for the lack of protection against XML
Entity Expansion attacks in some functions, because of the incomplete
fix in CVE-2012-6532. It appears that this also affects more than just
Zend Framework 1.x, although that isn't critical to determining the
number of CVE IDs.

<http://framework.zend.com/security/advisory/ZF2014-02>

CVE-2014-2684 - This CVE is for the error in the consumer's verify
method that leads to acceptance of wrongly sourced tokens. The same
CVE is used for Zend Framework 1.x and ZendOpenId 2.x, even though the
code is not identical.

CVE-2014-2685 - This CVE is for the specification violation in which
signing of a single parameter is incorrectly considered sufficient.
Again, this CVE is for both Zend Framework 1.x and ZendOpenId 2.x.

Debian Bug     : 743175 754201

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Zend Framework, a PHP
framework. Except for CVE-2015-3154, all these issues were already fixed
in the version initially shipped with Jessie.

CVE-2014-2681

    Lukas Reschke reported a lack of protection against XML External
    Entity injection attacks in some functions. This fix extends the
    incomplete one from CVE-2012-5657.

CVE-2014-2682

    Lukas Reschke reported a failure to consider that the
    libxml_disable_entity_loader setting is shared among threads in the
    PHP-FPM case. This fix extends the incomplete one from
    CVE-2012-5657.

CVE-2014-2683

    Lukas Reschke reported a lack of protection against XML Entity
    Expansion attacks in some functions. This fix extends the incomplete
    one from CVE-2012-6532.

CVE-2014-2684

    Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov from the Ruhr-University
    Bochum reported an error in the consumer's verify method that lead
    to acceptance of wrongly sourced tokens.

CVE-2014-2685

    Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov from the Ruhr-University
    Bochum reported a specification violation in which signing of a
    single parameter is incorrectly considered sufficient.

CVE-2014-4914

    Cassiano Dal Pizzol discovered that the implementation of the ORDER
    BY SQL statement in Zend_Db_Select contains a potential SQL
    injection when the query string passed contains parentheses.

CVE-2014-8088

    Yury Dyachenko at Positive Research Center identified potential XML
    eXternal Entity injection vectors due to insecure usage of PHP's DOM
    extension.

CVE-2014-8089

    Jonas Sandstr√É¬∂m discovered an SQL injection vector when manually
    quoting value for sqlsrv extension, using null byte.

CVE-2015-3154

    Filippo Tessarotto and Maks3w reported potential CRLF injection
    attacks in mail and HTTP headers.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.11.13-1.1+deb7u1.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.9+dfsg-2+deb8u1.

For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed
in version 1.12.12+dfsg-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.12+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.

## Updated php-ZendFramework packages fix multiple vulnerabilities

[CVE-2014-2685](CVE-2014-2685.html)

## Description

```
Updated php-ZendFramework packages fix security vulnerabilities:

XML eXternal Entity (XXE) and XML Entity Expansion (XEE) flaws were
discovered in the Zend Framework. An attacker could use these flaws to cause
a denial of service, access files accessible to the server process, or
possibly perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks
(CVE-2014-2681, CVE-2014-2682, CVE-2014-2683).

Using the Consumer component of Zend_OpenId, it is possible to login using an
arbitrary OpenID account (without knowing any secret information) by using a
malicious OpenID Provider. That means OpenID it is possible to login using
arbitrary OpenID Identity (MyOpenID, Google, etc), which are not under the
control of our own OpenID Provider. Thus, we are able to impersonate any
OpenID Identity against the framework (CVE-2014-2684, CVE-2014-2685).

### Security

## Security Advisory: ZF2014-01

# ZF2014-01: Potential XXE/XEE attacks using PHP functions: simplexml\_load\_\*, DOMDocument::loadXML, and xml\_parse

Numerous components utilizing PHP's `DOMDocument`, `SimpleXML`, and `xml_parse`
functionality are vulnerable to two types of attacks:

* XML eXternal Entity (XXE) Injection attacks. The above mentioned extensions
  are insecure by default, allowing external entities to be specified by adding
  a specific DOCTYPE element to XML documents and strings. By exploiting this
  vulnerability an application may be coerced to open arbitrary files and/or TCP
  connections.
* XML Entity Expansion (XEE) vectors, leading to Denial of Service vectors. XEE
  attacks occur when the XML DOCTYPE declaration includes XML entity definitions
  that contain either recursive or circular references; this leads to CPU and
  memory consumption, making Denial of Service exploits trivial to implement.

## Action Taken

Continuing on the patches performed in [ZF2012-02](ZF2012-02.html)
and [ZF2012-05](ZF2012-05.html), we extended the patch to
all the usage of the PHP functions `simplexml_load_*`, `DOMDocument::loadXML`,
and `xml_parse`, in order to prevent XXE and XEE attacks across the framework.

We have provided new components, `Zend_Xml_Security` in ZF1 and the standalone
`ZendXml`, that scan and load XML documents to prevent the previous attacks. The
XXE attack is prevented using the `libxml_disable_entity_loader()` function to
disable the loading of ENTITY nodes. The XXE attack is prevented by checking for
the presence of ENTITY elements in the document type declaration; in such cases,
we throw an Exception with an error message indicating that we don't accept
ENTITY declarations in XML documents for security reasons.

Moreover, because of [PHP bug 64938](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=64938), we
have decided to manage the PHP-FPM scenario using an heuristic approach. We
perform a search inside the XML string to find usage of any `<!ENTITY"` element,
and, on detection, raise an exception.

Note: the libxml library used by PHP to manage XML documents has been fixed
against XEE attacks starting from libxml2 version 2.9. If you are using this
version you can use the existing PHP functions without security concerns.

The following components/libraries were patched, at the version specified:

* Zend Framework 1, version 1.12.4
* Zend Framework 2, versions 2.1.6 and 2.2.6
* [ZendOpenId](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendOpenId), version 2.0.2
* [ZendRest](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendRest), version 2.0.2
* [ZendService\_Amazon](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Amazon), version 2.0.3
* [ZendService\_Api](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Api), version 1.0.0
* [ZendService\_AudioScrobbler](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_AudioScrobbler), version 2.0.2
* [ZendService\_Nirvanix](https://github.com/zendframework/ZendService_Nirvanix), version 2.0.2

### Acknowledgments

The Zend Framework team thanks the following for identifying the issues and
working with us to help protect its users:

* Lukas Reschke (lukas@owncloud.org) for reporting the potential XXE attacks in
  some components of ZF1, not previously fixed, and to suggest a possible fix
  for PHP-FPM scenarios
* P√°draic Brady (padraic.brady@gmail.com) for implementing the first XEE
  security patch (ZF2012-02)
* Enrico Zimuel (enrico@zend.com) for improving the previous solution, extending
  it to all the use cases.
