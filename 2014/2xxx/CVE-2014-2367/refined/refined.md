Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2014-2367:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Improper authentication in the `ChkCookie` subroutine within the `broadweb\include\gChkCook.asp` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing authentication checks. Specifically, if the `user`, `proj`, and `scada` parameters are set and the `bwuser` parameter is set to true, the system will grant access to previously restricted pages. This essentially means that an attacker can gain access without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can gain access to restricted pages and functionalities without proper authentication. This can lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- The impact can include unauthorized reading of sensitive information, modifying critical system parameters, or even causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
- The vulnerability is present within an ActiveX control and an ASP page, so exploitation likely involves crafted web requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Advantech WebAccess system.
- No special privileges on the target system are required prior to exploitation.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft specific HTTP requests that include the specific parameters (`user`, `proj`, `scada`, `bwuser`).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is located within an ActiveX control (`gChkCook.asp`), and the relevant part of the code is the `ChkCookie` subroutine.
- The affected product is Advantech WebAccess v7.1 and earlier.
- The CVSS v2 base score is 7.5, indicating a high severity.
- The advisory mentions that exploits for this vulnerability are publicly available.
