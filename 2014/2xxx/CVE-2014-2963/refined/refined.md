Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2963:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically within the "my account area" of Liferay Portal. This allows for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a persistent XSS issue. Malicious scripts can be injected through specific parameters in the "my account area" and stored, leading to execution each time the affected page is loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information leakage:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information from logged-in users.
- **Privilege escalation:**  Attackers could potentially gain higher privileges within the application through compromised user accounts.
- **Denial of service (DoS):**  Malicious scripts could disrupt the functionality of the Liferay portal, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the Liferay Portal's "my account area" can directly inject malicious scripts.
- An attacker can trick a logged-in user to visit a specially crafted URL containing malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "my account area" of the Liferay Portal or trick a logged-in user to access a malicious URL. This could be achieved through a compromised account or by crafting a link sent to users.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator. Any user with access to the "my account area" can exploit this vulnerability.
