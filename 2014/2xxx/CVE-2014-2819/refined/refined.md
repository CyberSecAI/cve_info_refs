Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2014-2819:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer not properly validating permissions under specific conditions. This can lead to script being executed with elevated privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper permission validation in Internet Explorer.
- Elevation of Privilege vulnerability, allowing an attacker to gain higher privileges within the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability could elevate their privileges within Internet Explorer.
- While the vulnerability alone does not allow arbitrary code execution, it could be chained with another vulnerability such as remote code execution to gain user-level or higher access.
- Specifically, an attacker could exploit another vulnerability to run code with low privileges and then use this vulnerability to elevate the privileges to medium integrity level (same as the current user), making it more impactful.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web-based attack scenarios:
    - Attackers can host a malicious website to exploit the vulnerability.
    - Attackers can utilize compromised websites or sites that accept user-provided content.
- Attackers need to convince users to visit the malicious site through methods like phishing emails or instant messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or inject content into web pages.
- Ability to persuade users to visit the attacker-controlled content via social engineering (e.g., email/instant messaging with malicious links).
- Ability to chain this vulnerability with another one (such as remote code execution).

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability was publicly disclosed prior to the release of the security bulletin.
- Microsoft received reports that other vulnerabilities in the same bulletin were being exploited, but not this one specifically.
- The vulnerability is addressed by adding additional permission validations to Internet Explorer.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Internet Explorer including versions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.
- The severity is rated as "Important" on client systems and "Moderate" on server systems.
