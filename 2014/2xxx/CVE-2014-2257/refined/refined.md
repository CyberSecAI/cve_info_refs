Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2014-2257:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper input validation when processing specially crafted packets sent on port 102/tcp (ISO-TSAP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of input data within the ISO-TSAP protocol implementation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, forcing the affected device into a "defect mode".
*   The device requires a cold restart to recover from this state, disrupting normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based, specifically targeting port 102/tcp, which is used by the ISO-TSAP protocol.
*   Attackers can exploit this remotely by sending specially crafted packets to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp of the target device.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).
*   The CVSS v2 base score is 7.8, with a vector string of (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C)
*   The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.5, with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
