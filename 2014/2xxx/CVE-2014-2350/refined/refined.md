- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Emerson DeltaV application has diagnostic telnet ports that use hardcoded credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hardcoded credentials (CWE-798) in diagnostic telnet ports of DeltaV service processes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access via telnet, potentially leading to partial compromise of integrity and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the affected system and must be able to discover the diagnostic telnet ports and the hardcoded credentials. The attacker also needs to have a low skill level to execute this attack.
