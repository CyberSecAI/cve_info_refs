The provided content is related to CVE-2014-2377.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ecava IntegraXor SCADA server includes built-in application tags that disclose information such as full path names of files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Sensitive Information Disclosure (CWE-526 and CWE-532): The application tags expose sensitive information such as file path names.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The disclosed information (file path names) can be leveraged by an attacker in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (specifically, SQL Injection) to potentially gain unauthorized access to files and data. The direct impact is limited to information disclosure (confidentiality)

**Attack vectors:**
Remote exploitation. An attacker could access the vulnerable application tags remotely via the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SCADA server. Low skill level is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability, but leveraging the information requires exploiting another vulnerability (SQL injection).
