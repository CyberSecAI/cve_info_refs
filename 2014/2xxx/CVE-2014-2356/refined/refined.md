- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper authorization checks in the HTTPS CGI interface of Innominate mGuard devices, allowing an attacker to download a configuration snapshot without prior authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Exposure (CWE-200). Specifically, unauthorized access to a configuration snapshot through the HTTPS CGI interface.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to download a configuration snapshot, which contains configuration data, current system information, and log files. This information can be used for further network reconnaissance, potentially revealing network topology, traffic flows, and information about connected systems.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a carefully crafted URL used against the device's HTTPS CGI interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device's HTTPS CGI interface. The attacker does not need to be authenticated. A moderate level of skill is required to craft the URL.
