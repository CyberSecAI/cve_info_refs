Vulnerability title: SetUID/SetGID Programs Allow Privilege Escalation
Via Insecure RPATH in BMC Patrol for AIX
CVE: CVE-2014-2591
Vendor: BMC
Product: Patrol for AIX
Affected version: 3.9.00
Fixed version: N/A
Reported by: Tim Brown

Details:

It has been identified that binaries that are executed with elevated
privileges (SetGID and SetUID programs) have been compiled in manner
that means they searched for libraries in insecure locations.

An attacker could place a malicious library in one of the affected
directories, which would then be loaded when the affected program is
run, leading to privilege escalation in instances where the program runs
with privileges that the attacker does not have.
