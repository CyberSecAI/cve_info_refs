Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2014-2778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Word parses specially crafted files. Specifically, it is related to the handling of embedded fonts within these files. The root cause is improper handling of objects in memory during parsing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The vulnerability results in memory corruption when parsing specially crafted files, specifically related to how embedded fonts are handled. This corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By corrupting the memory in a specific way, the attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the same privileges as the current user.
- **Full System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker can gain complete control of the system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Data Breaches:** An attacker can view, change, or delete data.
- **Malware Installation:** An attacker can install programs on the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachment:** An attacker can send a specially crafted Office file as an email attachment. The user must open the file to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Web-Based Attack:** An attacker can host a website with a specially crafted Office file. They must convince the user to visit the website and open the file.
- **Compromised Websites:** Compromised websites or those accepting user-provided content could host the malicious files.
- **Social Engineering:** In all scenarios, the attacker needs to use social engineering to trick the user into opening the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Craft Malicious File:** The attacker needs the technical ability to create a specially crafted Office file containing the malicious embedded font.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must persuade the user to open the malicious file, whether through email or a website.
- **No Privilege Required:**  The attacker doesn't need any elevated privileges, the vulnerability is exploited on the user's level.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was privately reported.
- Microsoft had no reports of the vulnerability being actively exploited at the time of the bulletin.
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Word 2007 Service Pack 3 and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack Service Pack 3.
- Mitigation includes not opening files from untrusted or unexpected sources.
- The fix involves correcting how Microsoft Office parses specially crafted files.
