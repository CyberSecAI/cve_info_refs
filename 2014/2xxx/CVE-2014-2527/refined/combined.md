Subject: k4dirstat: Apostrophes not properly escaped in 'rm -rf' invocation
Date: Sat, 15 Mar 2014 04:01:42 +0100
```
Package: k4dirstat
Version: 2.7.3-1
Severity: important

Dear Maintainer,

this may be a possible security issue - in k4dirstat: when choosing to
permanently delete a directory (from the context menu in the directory tree
view, "Delete, no way to undelete - Ctrl Del"), I can see in the logs that
k4dirstat runs something like, in printf notation: " rm -rf '%s' " where
apostrophes are not escaped in the dir name.

/home/user/Jim's pictures

generates

rm -rf '/home/user/Jim's pictures'

and a directory called

/home/user/malicious'; rm -rf ~

may be harmful.

Best regards

Subject: CVE request: kdirstat, insufficient quote escaping leading to arbitrary
command execution
Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:21:33 +1100
```
Good morning,

Adrian Panasiuk discovered that the KDirStat (KDE Directory Statistics)
tool did not correctly escape quotes when deleting a directory
permanently. Attempting to use KDirStat to permanently delete a
directory that has a malicious name could result in arbitrary command
execution.

Original report: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=741659>

The Debian report is about single quotes. On Fedora
(<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1077059>) double quotes were
needed.

Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already? (And maybe it
should be escaping ';' too if not already?)

Thanks,

--

> The Debian report is about single quotes. On Fedora
> (<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1077059>) double quotes were
> needed.

The recent upstream patch:

  <https://bitbucket.org/jeromerobert/k4dirstat/commits/1ad2e96d73fa06cd9be0f3749b337c03575016aa#chg-src/kcleanup.cpp>

addressed the ' issue using the '\\'' approach.

<http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/19/Everything/source/SRPMS/k/k4dirstat-2.7.0-0.9.20101010git6c0a9e6.fc19.src.rpm>
has:

    expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%p" ),
                      "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->url() )  + "\"" );
    expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%n" ),
                      "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->name() ) + "\"" );

As mentioned in the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/09/1> post, attempted
use of " for this type of quoting is a conceptually different problem
than attempted use of ' for this type of quoting, even if both
attempts are ultimately incorrect.

(We did not try to check whether the upstream version made a change
from incorrect use of " to incorrect use of ' at some point. This
could be considered an incomplete fix.)

Use [CVE-2014-2527](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2527) for the vulnerability involving use of " (as shown
in the above calls to expanded.replace). This CVE assignment applies
to any upstream code or any Fedora-specific code that has this
specific issue.

Use [CVE-2014-2528](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2528) for the vulnerability involving use of ' (as shown
in the above <https://bitbucket.org> commit).

If anyone happens to identify a version of the code that does not
attempt any type of quoting, a third CVE assignment may be possible.

> (And maybe it should be escaping ';' too if not already?)

This would typically not be addressed as a separate fix.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1077059#c0)  Murray McAllister    2014-03-17 06:17:37 UTC  ``` Adrian Panasiuk discovered that the KDirStat (KDE Directory Statistics) tool did not correctly escape quotes when deleting a directory permanently. Attempting to use KDirStat to permanently delete a directory that has a malicious name could result in arbitrary command execution.  The original report is regarding single quotes. Testing with the Fedora revealed the issue there was with double quotes.

I have put it back in the summary (there is an "edit" button near the title of the page).  For bugs like this one (filed against the Security Response Product), we leave them in the "NEW" state until everywhere is fixed, and don't assign them to people. For the trackers/product specific bugs, such as [bug 1077061](show_bug.cgi?id=1077061 "CLOSED ERRATA - k4dirstat: insufficient quote escaping leading to arbitrary command execution [fedora-all]") and [bug 1077060](show_bug.cgi?id=1077060 "CLOSED ERRATA - kdirstat: k4dirstat: insufficient quote escaping leading to arbitrary command execution [fedora-19]"), you can change their state and assign those to yourself.  <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q1/590> has some discussion about the issue. I am unsure if there is a patch yet for the use of " characters :(   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1077059#c9)  Dmitrij S. Kryzhevich    2014-03-19 09:55:14 UTC  ``` Thanks.  I think we could use upstream patch as is ( <http://paste.fedoraproject.org/86626/52224521/> ) Gained var "QString expanded" just go to shell in the way it is formatted so there no need to make difference between ' and " in this part of code. Substitution for file/directory name go to the following sting: rm -rf %p There are no any spectial signs here.  But still I will run few tests.   And one more. It was a suprise for me that there is a new upstream here (  bitbucket.org/jeromerobert/k4dirstat ).   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1077059#c10)  Dmitrij S. Kryzhevich    2014-03-19 10:00:12 UTC  ``` Too many mistypes. My bad.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1077059#c11)  Dmitrij S.

Message-ID: <5326946D.40306@redhat.com>
Date: Mon, 17 Mar 2014 17:21:33 +1100

Subject: CVE request: kdirstat, insufficient quote escaping leading to arbitrary
 command execution

Good morning,

Adrian Panasiuk discovered that the KDirStat (KDE Directory Statistics)
tool did not correctly escape quotes when deleting a directory
permanently. Attempting to use KDirStat to permanently delete a
directory that has a malicious name could result in arbitrary command
execution.

Original report: <https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=741659>

The Debian report is about single quotes. On Fedora
(<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1077059>) double quotes were
needed.

Can a CVE please be assigned if one has not been already? (And maybe it
should be escaping ';' too if not already?)

Thanks,

--

The recent upstream patch:

  <https://bitbucket.org/jeromerobert/k4dirstat/commits/1ad2e96d73fa06cd9be0f3749b337c03575016aa#chg-src/kcleanup.cpp>

addressed the ' issue using the '\\'' approach.

<http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/19/Everything/source/SRPMS/k/k4dirstat-2.7.0-0.9.20101010git6c0a9e6.fc19.src.rpm>
has:

    expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%p" ),
                      "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->url() )  + "\"" );
    expanded.replace( QRegExp( "%n" ),
                      "\"" + QString::fromLocal8Bit( item->name() ) + "\"" );

As mentioned in the
<http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/02/09/1> post, attempted
use of " for this type of quoting is a conceptually different problem
than attempted use of ' for this type of quoting, even if both
attempts are ultimately incorrect.

(We did not try to check whether the upstream version made a change
from incorrect use of " to incorrect use of ' at some point. This
could be considered an incomplete fix.)

Use CVE-2014-2527 for the vulnerability involving use of " (as shown
in the above calls to expanded.replace). This CVE assignment applies
to any upstream code or any Fedora-specific code that has this
specific issue.

Use CVE-2014-2528 for the vulnerability involving use of ' (as shown
in the above <https://bitbucket.org> commit).

If anyone happens to identify a version of the code that does not
attempt any type of quoting, a third CVE assignment may be possible.

> (And maybe it should be escaping ';' too if not already?)

This would typically not be addressed as a separate fix.
