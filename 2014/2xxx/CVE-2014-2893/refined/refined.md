Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2014-2893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `GetHTMLRunDir` function in Clang's `scan-build` utility creates temporary directories in an insecure manner, due to:
1.  **Predictable directory names:** The directory names are generated using a timestamp and the process ID, making them easily guessable.
2.  **Insecure permissions:** The directories are created with default permissions instead of being restricted to the owner (0700).
3.  **Lack of existence check:** The function doesn't properly check if a directory already exists, even if owned by another user, leading to potential race conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Handling:** The core issue is the improper handling of temporary files and directories, which are created with predictable names, insecure permissions, and without proper existence checks.
*   **Symlink Attack:** The vulnerability allows for symlink attacks where a malicious local user can create a symlink to a temporary directory, potentially leading to the tool writing data to unintended locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive information could be exposed if the tool writes data to a location accessible to an attacker.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A malicious user could manipulate the tool to overwrite arbitrary files on the system via a symlink attack on the temporary directories.
*   **Denial of Service:** By creating a directory with the same name, an attacker can prevent the program from creating its temporary directory, leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Symlink Creation:** The attacker needs to create a symlink to a temporary directory location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** A malicious local user with the ability to create files and directories is required.
*   **Knowledge of Temporary Directory Creation:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the `scan-build` utility generates temporary directory names.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Clang versions 3.5 and earlier.
*   The fix involved using a more random directory name generation, setting proper directory permissions, and ensuring the temporary directory does not already exist.
*   The Debian bug report provides detailed technical information about the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability also affects llvm versions 3.3 and 3.4.
