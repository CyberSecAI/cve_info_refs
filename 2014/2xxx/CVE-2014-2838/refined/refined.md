Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The GD Star Rating plugin for WordPress contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability and lacks CSRF protection on a form used for searching posts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to blind SQL injection through the `s` parameter in the search form.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The search form lacks CSRF protection.
*   **XSS:** The plugin was initially thought to be vulnerable to XSS, but this was later amended as a confusing reference. (Note: While the advisory initially mentioned XSS, it was later removed, suggesting it was not a primary vulnerability or was a mistake in the initial report)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to cause a denial of service.
*   **Data Compromise:** An attacker could potentially compromise sensitive data using SQL injection.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While SQL injection requires administrator access, CSRF allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an admin without directly having their credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:**  The attack is carried out over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Malicious Link/Page:** An attacker can craft a malicious link or a web page that, when visited by a logged-in administrator, exploits the CSRF vulnerability to perform SQL injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Access (Indirect):**  Direct administrator access is not strictly required if CSRF is exploited but an administrator needs to be logged in to the application.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP POST requests targeting the vulnerable form.
*   **Ability to Trick User:**  If exploiting CSRF, the attacker must trick a logged-in administrator into interacting with the crafted request.

**Technical Details:**

*   The SQL injection vulnerability is located in `code/adm/db.php` at line 154.
*   The vulnerable parameter is `s`.
*   The proof of concept uses a SQL `sleep` command to demonstrate the blind SQL injection.
*   The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an administrator without direct access to their account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by dxw and reported to WordPress.org.
*   The plugin should be disabled until a fix is released.
* The advisory was initially published with an incorrect reference to XSS and was amended to remove this reference.
* The advisory identifies two CVEs relating to this issue: CVE-2014-2838 (CSRF) and CVE-2014-2839 (SQLi).
