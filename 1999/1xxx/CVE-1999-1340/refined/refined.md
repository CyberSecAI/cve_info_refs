- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `faxalter` program, which is part of the hylafax-4.0.2 package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `faxalter` program has a buffer overflow vulnerability. It is also installed setuid-uucp by default, which means it runs with the privileges of the uucp user.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - A local user can exploit the buffer overflow to gain uucp privileges.
    - With uucp privileges, the attacker can potentially:
        - Modify programs that uucp has write access to (like minicom, cu, and ecu on FreeBSD 3.3), potentially leading to root compromise by trojaning these programs
        - Intercept faxes and uucp transmissions
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, by providing a specially crafted input to the vulnerable faxalter program as an argument.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any local user can exploit this vulnerability because `faxalter` is setuid-uucp and vulnerable to buffer overflow.
