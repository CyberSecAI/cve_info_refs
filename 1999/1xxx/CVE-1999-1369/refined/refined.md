- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Real Media Server stores the administrator password in plain text within the configuration file `rmserver.cfg`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive information (the administrator password) in clear text. Additionally, the default file permission for the configuration file (`644`) is not restrictive enough, potentially allowing unauthorized users to read the password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the `rmserver.cfg` file can obtain the administrator password, allowing them to potentially take full control of the Real Media Server. This could lead to unauthorized access to media content, the ability to modify or delete media, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local file access. An attacker needs to be able to read the `/usr/local/rmserver/rmserver.cfg` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to read the configuration file, which by default is readable by all users on the system due to its 644 permissions.
