Auto_FTP.pl v0.2 Advisory 10/5/99
Nightfall Security Group ([www.nfsg.org](http://www.nfsg.org))

Auto_FTP.pl is a perl script that utilizes a shared directory, anytime
something new is put into the shared directory it transfers it to the
specified ftp site. Auto_FTP is available via freshmeat.net at
<http://apps.freshmeat.net/download/938443720/>.

Auto_FTP uses a configuration file that can be found in
/etc/auto_ftp.conf, which contains the username, password and IP address
of the remote ftp site in plain text. Thereby allowing anyone
with read access to /etc to view the login and password to the ftp site.

Another problem is that the shared directory by default is /tmp/ftp_tmp
which can be viewed by any users on the machine. If you are transferring
sensitive material with Auto_FTP it won't be
sensitive for much longer.

Auto_FTP does not check to see what user is sending to the shared
directory. Any user on the local system could copy a file to
/tmp/ftp_tmp and have it transferred to the ftp.

Auto_FTP in summary:

- Stores login and password for remote ftp in plaintext configuration
file
- Uses a shared directory to automatically transfer files that by
default can be used and viewed by anyone
- Auto_FTP does not check to see what user sent a specific file to the
shared directory, therefore allowing anyone to copy a file to the shared
directory and have it transferred to the ftp. (The
default shared directory is /tmp/ftp_tmp).

In conclusion this program while it may be a good idea does not concern
itself with security precautions and is therefore not reccomended when
the contents of the data is important. Reminder,
plaintext passwords in a file that can be viewed by anyone is never a
good idea.
