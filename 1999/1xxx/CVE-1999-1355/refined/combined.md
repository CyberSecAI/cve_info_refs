Hello all,

Compaq does not seem to be doing impressive things with its security lately.
I just updated the Compaq Insight Agents and Support Software Diskettes from
version 4.22 to 4.23 and noticed that choosing the "express update" option
automatically added a PFCUser account to the system. By default this account
belongs to the local Administrators group, and is granted advanced user
rights that even the Administrators group doesn't ordinarily get (i.e. "Act
as part of the operating system," "Debug programs," "Generate security
audits," and "Replace a process level token"). The kicker is, the
installation program gives no indication that it is going to create this
account: it doesn't warn you, ask you, or anything else. Does this strike
anybody else as a bit presumptuous?
