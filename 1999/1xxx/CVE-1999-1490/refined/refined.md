- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `xosview` program uses `strcpy` to copy the value of the `HOME` environment variable into a fixed-size buffer `userrfilename` without any bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Buffer overflow due to the use of `strcpy` with an unchecked input from the `HOME` environment variable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite parts of the stack by setting a long HOME variable, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. The program runs with root privileges because it is a SUID binary.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to set the `HOME` environment variable to a string that exceeds the buffer size of `userrfilename` (1024 bytes).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be able to execute `xosview`.
    - The attacker needs control of the `HOME` environment variable.
