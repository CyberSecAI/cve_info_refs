- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SLmail SMTP service (slsmtp.exe) does not properly handle commands containing left brackets, causing it to enter a high CPU usage state.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation or handling of specific characters in SMTP commands. Specifically, the presence of a left bracket character `(` in any of the listed commands triggers the vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause a denial of service by making the slsmtp.exe process consume 100% CPU. This renders the SMTP service unresponsive to further connections, including legitimate email traffic.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker connects to the SMTP service via telnet on port 25 and sends crafted SMTP commands containing a left bracket such as `send (`, `vrfy (`, `expn (`, `mail from: (`, or `rcpt to: (`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable mail server's port 25. No authentication is required.
