- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of checking in one of the scripts used by the Tiger security tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A local user can craft a command that will be executed with the privileges of the process running Tiger. This is due to insufficient input validation or sanitization in the script.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user could gain root privileges by exploiting the vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user must craft a malicious command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local user on the system where Tiger is installed and running.
