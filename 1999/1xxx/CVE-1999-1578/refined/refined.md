Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a buffer overflow vulnerability within the `InvokeRegWizard` ActiveX control (regwizc.dll), which ships with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 and 5.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   A remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the safe-for-scripting ActiveX control `regwizc.dll`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on a victim's system by luring them to view a malicious web page. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a malicious web page. The attacker would need to craft a web page that exploits the buffer overflow in the `InvokeRegWizard` ActiveX control when viewed in Internet Explorer 4.01 or 5.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host or distribute a malicious web page, and the victim needs to be using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer (4.01 or 5). The victim would need to visit this crafted web page to trigger the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The ActiveX control CLSID is {50E5E3D1-C07E-11D0-B9FD-00A0249F6B00}.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-37.
