Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Cheyenne Arcserve Exchange DB Agent (and potentially other products like Innoculan AV for Exchange) creating a log file, `c:\exchverify.log`, during installation. This log file inadvertently stores sensitive authentication information, including passwords, in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Plaintext Password Storage:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of user passwords in cleartext within the `c:\exchverify.log` file.
*   **Insecure Logging Practices:** The software logs sensitive information without proper security measures.
*   **Lack of Documentation:** The existence and purpose of `c:\exchverify.log` are not documented, leaving administrators unaware of the potential exposure.
*   **Persistence of the Log:** The log file is not automatically removed after installation, leaving the sensitive information accessible on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Compromise:** Attackers gaining access to the `c:\exchverify.log` file can obtain plaintext passwords for high-level accounts used during the installation process.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Compromised accounts can be used to gain further access to the Exchange Server and other systems in the network.
*   **Data Breach:** Access to privileged Exchange accounts can enable attackers to gain access to and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in Exchange.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local File Access:** An attacker with local access to the server can read the `c:\exchverify.log` file to obtain the plaintext passwords.
*   **Compromised Service:** An attacker who has compromised the server through another vulnerability, can then access the log file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of access to the server that hosts the `c:\exchverify.log` file.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to read files on the system.

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue was initially found in Cheyenne Arcserve Exchange DB Agent version 2 installation, but may be present in other Cheyenne products and potentially other backup/AV products that have modules for Exchange Server (e.g., Innoculan AV for Exchange).
*   ArcServe Backup for Exchange Build 53 included the length of the user password in the log. Build 57 includes the actual password in plain text, which made the problem worse.
*   The log file is created during the installation process, and may or may not be removed after installation.
*   The issue appears to occur when Exchange Server 5.5 is in use.

This vulnerability poses a significant risk, as it directly exposes high-level account credentials.
