Ok, so here's the latest.

1. The file, c:\exchverify.log IS NOT created by Exchange Server, its
definitely created by Cheyenne.

2. Innoculan and ArcServe both have modules for Exchange Server. It seems
that both of these products (Innoculan AV for Exchange and ArcServe Backup
for Exchange) create the file c:\exchverify.log during installation. Lots of
people have sent in the link
<<http://www.cheyenne.com/CheyTech/techbases/ilnt/31003.html>> as proof. I
don't have a comprehensive list of versions yet, but so far it appears that
this only happens when Exchange Server 5.5 is the MSX server in use
(speculation).

3. Build 53 of ArcServe Backup for Exchange puts the # of characters in the
user password in the file, whereas Build 57 puts the password in plaintext
(meaning the problem got worse with the newer version). Build 57 is the
latest version of this product available from CAI.

4. CAI Tech Support did get back to me yesterday, but the technician
attempted to say that Build 57 fixed the problem. Obviously it didn't
(thanks Craig Gorski). When I told them I didn't think the info was correct,
they went off to do more checking. I received a call this morning from them
telling me the problem has now been escalated to their 2nd level support
crew (who, apparently, write code fixes). Wonderful I said, but where's the
info on what version does what?? Still waiting for a reply.

I've had no confirmation that you can safely remove the file
(c:\exchverify.log), or that after removing it, it doesn't reappear upon
reboot. I suspect it can be deleted, and is probably only used during the
installation process to allow their setup program to have sufficient
permissions to do its thing. If you're going to test this theory, then make
sure you simply rename the file (and/or move it to a secure location) in
case, after reboot, the service fails to start.

Reports on successful removal would be appreciated.

No word on what the passwords in the registry keys affect, anyone got any
ideas?

FYI, CAI seems not to know that NTBugtraq exists. They're being pretty
responsive to me in my phone calls, especially considering I'm not even a
licensed customer. I wouldn't infer too much by their lack of formal
response here (although I'm disappointed...;-]).

Cheers,
Russ - NTBugtraq moderator

On a recent browse around my exchange server here, I came across a file I
hadn't noticed before, c:\exchverify.log (yes I should have seen it
before...)

The contents of this file seem to indicate it is a log of the authentication
verification process undertaken by the Cheyenne Arcserve Exchange DB Agent
version 2 installation. So what? It contained much authentication stuff
along with a few lines of:

<EXCH-VERIFY>: ExchAuthenticate() called with NTServerName:[KBJV_SRV1]
NTDomainName[KBJV_PERTH] adminMailbox:[xxxxxx] adminLoginName:[xxxxxx]
password:[xxxxxx]

with account, mailbox and password info in plain text. I had had trouble
installing it last time and the log contained the three different accounts I
had tried to install into, all with passwords. We're talking high level
accounts here.

I checked, and this log is not mentioned anywhere in the docs or on
Cheyenne/CA's site. It might have been useful when I had the above troubles,
but to not know about it or have it cleaned up...

Jamie.
