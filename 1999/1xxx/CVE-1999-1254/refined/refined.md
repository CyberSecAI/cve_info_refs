- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way Windows 9x/NT handles ICMP Redirect messages. The exploit sends a storm of these messages to the target machine, causing it to repeatedly modify its route table.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the Windows TCP/IP stack's susceptibility to a flood of ICMP Redirect messages.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This attack can cause the targeted Windows machine to become unresponsive, slow down drastically, or even freeze. Applications may execute slowly or fail to run.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is launched by sending a flood of ICMP Redirect messages towards the victim machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same LAN as the victim. The attacker also needs to spoof a router IP address in the ICMP redirect messages.
