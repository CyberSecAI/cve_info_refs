- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Buffer overflow in the Palm Hotsync Manager when handling network connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Hotsync Manager does not properly handle large amounts of data sent to port 14238, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to crash the Hotsync application, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the machine running the Hotsync. This is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a large amount of data followed by a newline to port 14238, when the Hotsync manager is in network mode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the machine running the vulnerable Hotsync manager.
