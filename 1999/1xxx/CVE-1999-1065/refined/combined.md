Hi.

In the spirit of w00giving, we did a little research on attacks that can be
performed on the Palm Pilot (we're also searching for tools that can turn
the Palm into an attacking tool, but that's another thing).
A hotsync DoS attack is not as sexy as breaking to networks via printers,
but it still deserves some attention ;-)

The Palm Hotsync manager is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack that can
crash the hotsync application and possibly be used to execute arbitrary code
on the machine running the hotsync.

Vulnerable systems:
HotSync Manager 3.0.4 under Windows 98

Non Vulnerable systems:
HotSync Manager under Windows 2000

Details
--------
When the Hotsync manager is set to 'network' mode, it listens on port 14238.
By sending a large amount of data to that port followed by a newline, it's
possible to crash the HotSync application.
3Com has been notified of this, and promised that the next release of the
Hotsync manager will be fixed.
