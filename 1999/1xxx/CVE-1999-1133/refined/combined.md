------------------------------------------------------------------------
**REVISED 02**HEWLETT-PACKARD SECURITY BULLETIN: #00058, 28 April 1997
Last Revised: 08 September 1997
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The information in the following Security Bulletin should be acted upon
as soon as possible.  Hewlett Packard will not be liable for any
consequences to any customer resulting from customer's failure to fully
implement instructions in this Security Bulletin as soon as possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM:   Buffer overflow condition in libXt/Error.c

PLATFORM:  HP 9000 series 700/800 systems running version 9.X or 10.X

DAMAGE:    Users could increase privileges.

SOLUTION:  Apply the patches listed below and relink any suid/sgid
           programs that use libXt.a.  Programs that use the shared
           library libXt.sl require no action other than loading
           the patches.

AVAILABILITY: All patches are available now.

CHANGE SUMMARY:  Added patches for HP-UX 10.24.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.

      library.  This can be exploited using suid/sgid programs
      to increase privileges.

   B. Fixing the problem
      Apply the library patches and relink any suid/sgid programs
      that are linked with the archived version of libXt.

      Title:  Security Advisory in vuefile, vuepad, et. al. in HP-UX

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
     HEWLETT-PACKARD SECURITY ADVISORY: #00069, 08 September 1997
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The information in the following Security Advisory should be acted upon
as soon as possible.  Hewlett Packard will not be liable for any
consequences to any customer resulting from customer's failure to fully
implement instructions in this Security Advisory as soon as possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM:  Users can inadvertently allow access to their accounts
          by running vuefile, vuepad, dtfile, or dtpad to displays
          they do not control.

PLATFORM: HP9000 Series 700/800s running HP-UX releases 9.X and 10.X

DAMAGE:   Users can gain privileges.

SOLUTION: Do not run vuefile, vuepad, dtfile, or dtpad while su'd to
          another account.  Also do not run them with the display set
          to another Xserver, unless the same account is logged in at
          each Xserver.

AVAILABILITY:  Not applicable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.
   A. Background
      Vuefile, vuepad, dtfile, and dtpad do not authenticate users.
      Care must be taken to insure that only one user per Xserver runs
      these programs.

   B. Fixing the problem
      The current and perhaps only solution is to avoid the situation.
      This advisory will be updated if patches become available.

   C. Recommended solution
      Inform users so that they can avoid the situation.  They should
      never run vuefile, vuepad, dtfile, or dtpad while su'd to another
      account.
      They also should never run these programs with the display directed
      to another Xserver unless they are logged into that Xserver in the
      same account.

      One way to make it more difficult for a user to su and run these
      programs is to enable per user authorization.  This eliminates
      the potential for a user to run the programs on the wrong display
      by accidentally mistyping the display name.

      Per-user authorization is the default in CDE.  In Vue, it can be
      enabled in /usr/vue/config/Xconfig:

        #  To enable R4 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 per-user authorization.
        #
        Vuelogin*authorize:         True

      Note that if per-user authorization is not enabled many
      security breaches are possible.  For example, it is possible
      for a program to capture keystrokes typed on the Xserver.

      The root user can circumvent the per-user authorization and
      non-root users can give the Xauthority away.  So all users
      still must be aware not to run vuefile, vuepad, dtfile, or
      dtpad as described above.

   D. To subscribe to automatically receive future NEW HP Security
      Bulletins from the HP Electronic Support Center via electronic
