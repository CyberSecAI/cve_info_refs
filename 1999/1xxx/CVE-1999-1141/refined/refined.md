- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An error in the Timeplex Routers allows unauthorized access through a special 'debug' mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The debug mode can be accessed without authentication by sending a number of `cntrl-d` sequences to the device.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The debug mode allows manipulation of the router at the register level, resetting the router, denial of service, and potentially gaining further access to the network or changing router configurations.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a sequence of `cntrl-d` characters to the router.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the router.
