An error in Timeplex Routers allows a user to gain unauthorized access to the device \
through a special 'debug' mode. This mode allows manipulation of the router at the \
register level, as well as being able to reset the router or deny service. The \
'debug' mode can be entered without logging into the router, by sending a number of \
cntrl-d sequences to the device. The router will then display it's ip address and \
other information and drop to a debug prompt.

This information could be used to gain further access to a network, or to change the \
router setup, or deny service. For further information, please contact Ascom.
