Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerabilities in Excite for Web Servers 1.1, as reported by Michael Gerdts:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The installation process sets world-writable permissions on crucial files, including `Architext.conf`, which contains the encrypted password used for authentication.
*   **Reliance on Encrypted Password:**  Authentication after the initial login to `AT-admin.cgi` relies solely on the encrypted password, which is easily obtainable from the world-readable `Architext.conf`
*   **Weak Password Encryption:** The password encryption method is flawed, as the first two characters of the encrypted password always match the first two characters of the plaintext password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **World-Writable Configuration File:** The `Architext.conf` file, containing the encrypted password, is installed with world-writable permissions.
*   **Insecure Authentication:**  The authentication mechanism relies entirely on the encrypted password, making it vulnerable if the password file is accessible.
*   **Predictable Password Encryption:** The flawed encryption method makes dictionary and brute-force attacks significantly easier.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Administrative Control:**  Any user with shell or FTP access to the web server can gain complete administrative privileges over EWS by modifying or obtaining the encrypted password from `Architext.conf`.
*   **Unauthorized Access to Administrative Functions:** By crafting a malicious web page and using the leaked password, attackers can perform administrative tasks as if they were logged in with the correct credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Shell Access:** Attackers can exploit the world-writable permissions and read the `Architext.conf` file directly from the server's file system if they have shell access.
*   **FTP Access:**  Attackers with FTP access can also read the `Architext.conf` file.
*   **Malicious Web Page:** A user can create a web page that sends a POST request to `AT-generate.cgi` with the leaked encrypted password, granting access to administrative functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Shell or FTP Access:** Attackers need to have either shell access or FTP access to the web server's file system to read the `Architext.conf` file.
*   **Basic Web Development Knowledge:**  The attacker needs to be able to create a simple HTML form to exploit the authentication bypass.
*   **Knowledge of the Server Location:** The attacker would need to know the web server's URL and the location of the vulnerable CGI scripts.
