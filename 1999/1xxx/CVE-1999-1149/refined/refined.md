- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending 1030 or more characters to the FTP port (21) of CSM Proxy 4.1 causes a crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The CSM Proxy software has a buffer overflow or similar vulnerability when processing long input strings on the FTP port, which leads to a crash. The software does not properly validate input length when handling connections to the FTP port.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack causes the CSM Proxy service to crash and results in 100% CPU usage, effectively resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS). This requires a restart on Windows 95 or a reboot on Windows NT to restore functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a string of 1030 characters or more to the FTP port (21).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any user on the network (including the Internet if the proxy is not behind a firewall) can connect to the FTP port and send the malicious string.
