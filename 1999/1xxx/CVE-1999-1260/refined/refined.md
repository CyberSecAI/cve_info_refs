- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The mSQL server discloses sensitive information in response to a remote `ServerStats` request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Information disclosure: The `ServerStats` response reveals active database connections, including user names, database names, and hostnames. This exposes authentication information which could be used to access databases.
    - Version disclosure: The server version is included in the response, allowing attackers to identify vulnerable versions.
    - Connection information: The number of current and maximum connections is revealed, aiding in potential denial-of-service attacks.
    - User name and ID of the `msqld` process are revealed, potentially providing OS information.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized access to databases: Attackers can use the disclosed user names and hostnames to gain access to databases.
    - Denial of Service:  Information about connection limits could be used to launch effective DoS attacks.
    - Information gathering: Attackers can gather information about the server and the underlying OS.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a `ServerStats` request to the mSQL server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the mSQL server. The server must have remote access enabled, which was the default prior to version 2.0.4.1. If host-based access control is enabled, the attacker could perform more complex attacks such as DNS cache poisoning.
