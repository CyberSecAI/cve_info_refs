- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of credential checking in the kernel when setting the recipient of I/O notification. The kernel does not verify if the process setting the signal recipient has the right to do so, which means any process can set an arbitrary process ID to receive signals.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The kernel does not check credentials when a process sets the recipient of I/O notification via `fcntl()` (F_SETOWN) or `ioctl()` (FIOSETOWN, TIOCSPGRP).
    - Vulnerable kernels do not track credentials associated with a process when determining whether to send I/O signals.
    - This allows for arbitrary signal sending via `SIGIO` or `SIGURG` signals, and even other signals in the case of the BPF device.
    - Process ID re-use is also a problem, where an attacker can kill their own process to free up the PID, and then target the newly created process with the same ID.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service by killing off arbitrary processes, or disrupting their operation through stray signals.
    - Compromise of the system through targeted process termination and port stealing (e.g., killing an NFS process and stealing its port).
    - The severity of the impact can vary between OSes, due to different default dispositions of the signals used to trigger the vulnerability (`SIGIO`, `SIGPOLL`, `SIGURG`).
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious program can use `fcntl()` or `ioctl()` on a socket or device to set the signal recipient to an arbitrary process or process group ID.
    - Exploitation can occur using sockets, the "log" device, and possibly other devices that provide I/O notification facilities.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An unprivileged user can exploit this vulnerability.
    - The attacker needs the ability to use `fcntl()` and `ioctl()` system calls on affected file descriptors.
    - No specific network access is required since the attack is local.

The advisory provides more details than the CVE description, including specific vulnerable ioctls (FIOSETOWN, TIOCSPGRP), example devices (log, tun, bpf), and the process ID reuse vulnerability. It also specifies the exact signals that can be sent (SIGIO, SIGURG) and a detailed explanation of the vulnerability mechanics and how to exploit it. The provided patch details the code changes to add credential checking to affected systems.
