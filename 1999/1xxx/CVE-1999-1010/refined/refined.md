- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SSH1 server implementations do not validate if the cipher chosen by the client is within the list of ciphers offered by the server during the connection setup.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server fails to enforce its own policy regarding allowed encryption ciphers, particularly the "none" cipher.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious client can force the server to use the "none" cipher, leading to unencrypted communication. This exposes the SSH session to network-level attacks such as connection hijacking and other subtle exploits due to the lack of encryption.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious SSH client can send a request to use the "none" cipher to the server, regardless of the server's policy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control the SSH client and be able to connect to the vulnerable SSH server.
