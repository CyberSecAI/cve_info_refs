Prasad Dabak of Cybermedia Software Private Limited has discovered yet
another security risk in Windows NT involving the operating system's case
sensitivity. According to the report, using the permissions on the "\??"
object directory and by exploiting the case sensitivity of object manager,
it is possible to trojan any system executables.

Any ordinary user has write permissions on \?? Object directory. This is to
allow user to map network drives or use "subst" utility to alias a directory
to a new drive letter. Each system drive has an entry into \?? object
directory. Each entry is actually a symbolic link which points to the device
associated with that drive (ergo: Symbolic link \??\C: will typically point
to a device such as \Device\HardDisk0\Partition1). It is possible to create
a trojaned version of this symbolic link using the different character
case -- for example, it is possible to create a symbolic link such as \??\c:
(notice the small letter "c".) By doing this, all the requests to drive C
get routed through the trojaned symbolic link.

Please visit the following URL, where you'll find the further details along
with links to a demonstration of the problem.

Hello,

In this context (symbolic links) I remembered an archaic tool named
mnt.exe (dated 2-25-95, 5632 bytes, the author is - if I remember
correctly - Christof Hochst=E4tter, then employed at MS germany), and my
own programming efforts to manage MO's which made use of these
techniques.

This Tool uses the API functions DefineDosDevice /  QueryDosDevice and
allows adding and removing drive mappings. They work like a stack, no
case sensitivity is needed to establish multiple definitions for a
letter. However, only the topmost mapping for any given drive is used by
the system and appears in the ?? directory.

The MSDN documentation of the DefineDosDevice function states that
  "Note: Drive letters and device names defined at system boot time are
protected from redefinition and deletion unless the user is an
administrator."

Perhaps this relates to the observations by Dominique Brezinski.
