Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities discussed:

**Vulnerability Overview**

The primary vulnerability across the tools (Satan, Cops, and Tiger) is a **race condition** arising from the use of predictable temporary file names in `/tmp` and other shared directories. Because these tools often run with root privileges, this allows for a local user to potentially manipulate the temporary files used by these scripts.

**Specific Vulnerabilities**

1.  **Satan v1.1.1 (bin/rex.satan):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The script creates a temporary file in `/tmp` using a predictable name (`/tmp/rex.$$`).
    *   **Weakness:** Race condition vulnerability due to the usage of a shared temp directory and a predictable file name.
    *   **Impact:** A local user can create a symbolic link with the same name before the tool does and have the tool write to an arbitrary location they control. This can be used for a denial of service (by writing to a critical file) or, depending on the system, gain root access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local attacker
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must have local access and be able to execute commands before the vulnerable tool executes.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use a temporary file in the script's local directory (e.g., `./rex.$$`).

2.  **Cops v1.04:**
    *   **res_diff:**
        *   **Root Cause:** The script creates temporary files in `/tmp` using predictable names (`/tmp/tmp.$$.foo`, `/tmp/tmp.$$.bar`).
        *   **Weakness:** Race condition vulnerability.
        *  **Impact:** A local attacker can create symbolic links to arbitrary files, potentially overwriting them or leading to DoS.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Local attacker
        *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access, the attacker needs to create the symlinks before the program executes.
        *   **Mitigation:** Create a unique temporary directory per execution using `mkdir` with `umask 077` to prevent other users from manipulating the temp files, and then store the temporary files within that directory.
    *   **checkacct/ca.src:**
        *   **Root Cause:** The script uses `touch /tmp/makedots${THISSHELL}` to create a temporary file.
        *   **Weakness:** The use of `touch` with an arbitrary path allows for symlink following, creating arbitrary files in the file system.
        *   **Impact:** Local attacker can create any file on the system, potentially causing a denial of service or privilege escalation if the attacker can create or modify a suitable file.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Local attacker.
        *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access. The attacker has to create a symlink before the program executes.
        *    **Mitigation:** Create a temporary directory and use touch in this directory.
    *   **extra_src/mail.chk:**
        *   **Root Cause:** The script creates temporary files in `/usr/tmp` using predictable names (`/usr/tmp/mchk.p$$`, `/usr/tmp/mchk.t$$`).
        *   **Weakness:** Race condition vulnerability.
        *   **Impact:** Allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files by creating symbolic links with the temp file names.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Local attacker
        *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access, the attacker must create the symlink before the program executes.
        *    **Mitigation:** Create a unique temporary directory per execution under `/usr/tmp` and use files within that directory.

3.  **Tiger v2.2.3:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The tool uses `/tmp` as the default working directory, and many temporary files are created there.
    *   **Weakness:** Race condition vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** A local attacker can exploit race conditions when the program tries to create temporary files and symlink attacks are possible.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Local attacker
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Local access. Attacker needs to create a symlink before the program executes.
    *   **Mitigation:** Set the default working directory to `$TIGER_HOME/tmp` and create the directory if it doesn't exist.

**General Impact:**

The exploitation of these vulnerabilities can potentially lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overwriting critical system files, an attacker could render the system unusable.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In specific configurations, overwriting certain files could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite files they normally don't have permissions for using symbolic link attacks.

**Summary**

The common theme across these vulnerabilities is the use of predictable temporary files in shared directories like `/tmp`, leading to race conditions.  The patches provided include creating unique temporary directories and using local directories for temporary files to mitigate these issues.
