Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described as the 'sioux' DoS attack in Apache, which is related to CVE-1999-1199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a memory leak in the way Apache handles incoming request headers. Specifically, sending a large number of headers, such as "User-Agent" headers, causes the server to consume excessive memory. The memory consumption increases polynomially with the amount of header data sent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Repeatedly sending specially crafted requests with numerous headers causes the Apache server to allocate memory without releasing it.
- **Denial of Service:** This memory leak can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service condition. By sending a large number of headers, an attacker can force the server to consume all available memory, leading to a crash or severe performance degradation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server Crash:** The most severe impact is a server crash due to memory exhaustion.
- **Performance Degradation:** Even if the server doesn't crash, the excessive memory consumption can severely degrade its performance, making it unresponsive to legitimate user requests.
- **High CPU usage:** The server may experience a significant increase in CPU usage while trying to process the large number of headers, further contributing to the denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests. These requests include a large number of repeated headers, such as "User-Agent."
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be initiated remotely from any network location with the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the targeted Apache server.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests to craft the malicious requests with a large number of headers.
- **Scripting/Programming Skills:** The attacker might use a simple script or program to automate the process of sending the malicious requests. Example code is provided in one of the documents.
