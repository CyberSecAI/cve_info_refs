A fix for TurboLinux 2.0 USA and 2.0 Japanese to fix the 'sioux' DOS
attack in Apache can be found at:

ftp://ftp.pht.com/pub/turbolinux-2.0-updates/i386/apache-1.3.1-6TL.i386.rpm
ftp://ftp.pht.com/pub/turbolinux-2.0-updates/SRPMS/apache-1.3.1-6TL.src.rpm

After installing this update, make sure to stop and restart apache, either
using xturboservice or manually from the commandline:

/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd stop
(sometimes you must do that twice to get all the processes)
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd start

Proper behavior after this update is applied is for the 'sioux' exploit
program to simply report 'broken pipe' and exit, with no adverse effects
on the server side.

A security problem has been found in apache.  It allows users to crash
the webserver from a remote system, and should be fixed as soon as
possible.

I tried the sioux bug on Website c2.3 for NT and I noticed in the processes

There seems to be a simple way of badly DoSing any Apache server. It
involved a massive memory leak in the way it handles incoming request
headers. I based my exploit on the assumption that they use setenv()
(which they don't) and that the bug occurs when you send a header that
will end up as an environment variable if you request a CGI script
(such as User-Agent), but I have since verified that there is no
connection there. Anyway, you can blow Apache through the roof by
sending it tons of headers - the server's memory consumption seems to
be a steep polynomial of the amount of data you send it. Below is a
snapshot of top(1) about one minute after I sent my server a request
with 10,000 copies of "User-Agent: sioux\r\n" (totalling 190,016 bytes
of data)

---cut---

I know that there are many trivial ways of overloading a web server
(e.g. opening tons of connection to eat up file descriptors and
process slots), but this one seemed a little extreme, to say the
least.

Please note that I've only tested this on Apache 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, not
on 1.3.1. However, there is no mention of this bug in the change log
for 1.3.1, so I'll assume it's vulnerable.

BTW, how can the Apache team be stupid enough not to provide a way of
submitting problem reports by email? If they did, I'd've sent this to
them first and given them a week, but they don't and I'm too friggin'
lazy to use their web interface...

Here's the 'sploit for the script kiddies. It should compile cleanly
and work on most Unices. These are the ones I've tested it on:

FreeBSD 2.2.x, FreeBSD 3.0, IRIX 5.3, IRIX 6.2:
  gcc -o sioux sioux.c

Solaris 2.5.1:
  gcc -o sioux sioux.c -lsocket -lnsl

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
