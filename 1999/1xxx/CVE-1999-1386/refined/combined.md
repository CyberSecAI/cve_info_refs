I think this one must be a very well known bug.  Still, it's not fixed
in Perl 5.004_04 (the lastest version, I guess).  It is similar to the
bugs in gcc and /bin/sort that were discussed on BUGTRAQ.

PROBLEM: open() on temporary files used for `-e' option processing uses
O_TRUNC and does not use O_EXCL.

IMPACT: a race condition exists when executing `perl -e ...'.  It can
be used for DOS attacks that will allow deletion of contents of files
that the user executing `perl -e' has write permissions for.  The
contents will be replaced with the text of the argument for `-e'
option.  This attack could be launched against say /etc/ftpusers or a
similar file in which case it might lead to a compromise.  If the
attacker can have some control over the command being executed via
`-e' he can overwrite ~root/.rhosts or equivalent, but probably the
system can be trivially compromised anyway.

SUGGESTED FIX: Add O_EXCL to the list of flags for open().  I do not
know if this really is a portable solution.  On systems that are not
broken this should work, though.

A side note (by no means I am a Perl hacker; I do not know Perl well):
Perl does not provide a clear way to open a file with O_EXCL.  This
might be considered a reasonable thing to add to the language.

EXAMPLE: Suppose an attacker knowns that root has `perl -e' in his
crontab.  Attacker runs a program which checks /proc (or runs ps a
lot) for processes that are started as `perl -e ...'.  (When such a
process is detected, the watching process may spawn a forking bomb
each instance of which allocates a lot of memory and accesses it to
make the machine swap hence possibly increasing the chances of winning
the race.)

$ strace perl -e ''
...
getpid()                                = 23777
        [Attacker notices process 23777 which is "perl -e".]
stat("/tmp/perl-ea23777", 0xbffff850)   = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
        [Attacker creates symlink /tmp/perl-ea23777 -> /etc/shadow.]
open("/tmp/perl-ea23777", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC, 0666) = 3
        [Now /etc/shadow is toast.]
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
        [Here Perl should have exited.  But alas, my libc isn't good
         enough, and Perl proceeds happily overwriting the file.]
...

I have run (after `echo root > /tmp/ftpusers')

        ./exploit_perl-e 5; perl -e ''; perl -e ''; perl -e ''; \
                perl -e ''; perl -e ''; ls -l /tmp/ftpusers | \
                awk '{if ($5 != "5") print "RACE WON"}'

It worked from like 10th attempt for me.

SOURCE INVESTIGATION:

In perl.c we read (comments are mine):

        case 'e':
            if (euid != uid || egid != gid)
                croak("No -e allowed in setuid scripts");
            if (!e_fp) {
                /* Copy TMPPATH to a safe location. */
                e_tmpname = savepv(TMPPATH);
                /* Generate a unique filename. */
                (void)mktemp(e_tmpname);
                if (!*e_tmpname)
                    croak("Can't mktemp()");
                /* Open this file for writing. */
                e_fp = PerlIO_open(e_tmpname,"w");

In perlio.c:

#undef PerlIO_open
PerlIO *
PerlIO_open(path,mode)
const char *path;
const char *mode;
{
 return fopen(path,mode);
}

So, we see that a prepared tempname is in fact opened as

        fopen (tempname, "w");

which in turn calls

        open (tempname, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC);

EXPLOIT:

It's trivial, but it is provided for completeness sake.

/* exploit_perl-e -- exploit race condition existing in Perl as of
   version 5.004_04.

   If one knows that some user is going to execute `perl -e ...' at
   some time (for example, it is placed in crontab or is run from
   ~/.procmailrc) a standard symlink exploit is possible.

   This code is provided for educational purposes only and should not
   be run without permission from system administrator of the machine
   it is being run on.

PATCH:

This is probably violating Perl source placing conventions but it
works.  Looking at the timestamp on the original perl.c one might
expect that the patch should apply cleanly to older versions, too.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
