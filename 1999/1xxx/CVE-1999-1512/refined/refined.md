The provided content describes a vulnerability in the AMaViS (A Mail Virus Scanner) utility for Linux. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way AMaViS constructs and sends email notifications about virus detections. The script uses the sender's email address (obtained from the `Reply-To` header) directly in a command to send an email, without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject shell commands into the sender's email address which are then executed when the mail program is invoked by the script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The script fails to sanitize the sender address before using it in a command, allowing for the injection of arbitrary shell commands. Specifically, the `mail` command is called with a user-controlled string.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The AMaViS script does not validate or sanitize the sender's email address, which could contain backticks, dollar signs, parenthesis or other characters that can lead to command execution.
- **Running as Root:** The AMaViS script is executed with root privileges, compounding the impact of the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Attackers can execute any command on the server with root privileges.
- **Full System Compromise:** A successful exploit can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.
- **Denial of Service:** Commands such as `/sbin/reboot` can be executed, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Email with malicious Reply-To:** The attacker crafts a specially formed email that includes a virus-infected file attachment. Critically, the `Reply-To` header contains the malicious command to be executed, e.g., "`/sbin/reboot`@dummy.com".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to Send Email:** The attacker needs the capability to send emails to a server running AMaViS.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the AMaViS vulnerability and how to exploit it via the Reply-To header.

**Additional Notes**
The provided content also includes a patch that attempts to address the vulnerability by sanitizing the sender's email address by removing potentially dangerous characters, including backticks, `$(`, and `)`. This prevents command injection through the sender address.
