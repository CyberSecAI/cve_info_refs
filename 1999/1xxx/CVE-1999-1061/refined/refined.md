RELATED: Yes
Root cause of vulnerability:
The HP Laserjet 4M Plus DirectJet printer allows bypassing lpd and page accounting by sending PostScript directly to TCP ports 9099 and 9100.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Lack of access control: The printer does not have a mechanism to restrict connections to a range of valid IP addresses.
- Remote configuration: It is possible to telnet to the printer and change its IP address or disable logging.
- Direct printing: PostScript documents can be sent directly to the printer via TCP ports 9099 and 9100, bypassing normal printing protocols.

Impact of exploitation:
- Bypassing lpd and page accounting.
- Unauthorized printing.
- Potential for denial-of-service by sending large print jobs.
- Ability to modify printer settings (IP address, logging) via telnet.

Attack vectors:
An attacker can connect to TCP ports 9099 or 9100 on the printer and send PostScript commands directly.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker must be on the same network as the printer or have network access to the printer's TCP ports 23, 515, 9099 and 9100.
