Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issues in Norton AntiVirus for Internet Email Gateways (NAVIEG) and Norton AntiVirus for MS Exchange (NAVMSE):

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure storage and handling of the administrator password for the products' web-based configuration interfaces. The password is stored in clear text, making it easily accessible to anyone who can access the configuration files or registry keys. Additionally, basic authentication, which sends passwords in clear text, is used for web access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Clear Text Password Storage:** The admin password for NAVIEG is stored in the `navieg.ini` file, and for NAVMSE, it's stored in the registry key `HKLM\Software\Symantec\NAVMSE\1.5\ModifyPassword`, both in plain text.
*   **Clear Text Authentication:** The products use basic authentication, transmitting the admin password in clear text over the network.
*   **Built-in Web Servers:** Both products include built-in web servers for configuration pages, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker who gains access to the configuration file, registry, or intercepts network traffic can obtain the clear text administrator password.
*   **System Compromise:** With the admin password, an attacker can fully control the NAVIEG or NAVMSE installations.
*   **Potential for Further Access:** Depending on the context, compromising these services could lead to further access to the network and other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local File Access:** An attacker with local access to the server could read the clear text password from the `navieg.ini` file or the registry.
*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could sniff network traffic to intercept the clear text admin password during login attempts to the web interface.
*   **Compromised System:** If the target machine is already compromised, access to the passwords would be trivial.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** For direct access to the configuration files or registry, local access to the server is needed.
*   **Network Access:** For sniffing network traffic, network access to the server hosting NAVIEG or NAVMSE is needed.
*   **Administrative Rights (to some degree):** While not explicitly stated, being an administrator on a compromised system is implied to be able to read the `navieg.ini` and/or the registry, although this is not explicit.
