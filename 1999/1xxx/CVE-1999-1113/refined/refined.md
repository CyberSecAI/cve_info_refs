The provided content describes two potential denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities affecting MacOS based software, specifically Eudora Internet Mail Server (EIMS) and Apple's Web Sharing.

**Eudora Internet Mail Server (EIMS) DoS:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Buffer overflow in the handling of the USER command.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unbounded buffer copy when processing the USER command.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  EIMS server crash, potentially leading to a crash of the entire machine.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a long string to the server through the USER command via a telnet connection on port 106.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to connect to the server on port 106 using telnet and send commands.

**Apple's Web Sharing DoS:**

*  **Root cause of vulnerability:** Buffer overflow in handling of HTTP requests.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unbounded buffer copy when processing input from the telnet connection to port 80.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Web Sharing service becomes unresponsive and stops servicing new requests. However, the server itself remains stable and the Web Sharing service can be restarted.
*   **Attack vectors:** Sending a long string to the server via a telnet connection on port 80, then pressing return twice.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to connect to the server on port 80 using telnet and send data.

The content provides specific details on how to trigger these vulnerabilities including the port numbers and commands to be sent over a telnet connection.
