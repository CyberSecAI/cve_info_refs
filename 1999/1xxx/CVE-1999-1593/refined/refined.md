{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "WINS (Windows Internet Name Service) does not validate 1Ch (domain controller) registrations sent to it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation in WINS registrations",
      "Reliance on NetBIOS, which lacks inherent security features"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite domain controller entries in WINS, redirecting authentication requests to a malicious server. This can lead to credential theft (especially if LanMan hashing is used) and denial-of-service for domain users due to failed logins.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending spoofed WINS registration messages",
      "Introducing a rogue server that claims to be a domain controller"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have the ability to send packets to the WINS server. They would need to be able to send NetBIOS packets to the WINS server to register as a domain controller. The attacker also needs a machine that can participate in the logon process to capture usernames and passwords"
  },
  "additional_details": {
     "mitigations": [
          "Use static WINS entries for sensitive records like domain controllers.",
          "Filter NetBIOS traffic at firewalls (TCP/UDP 135-139) to only allow trusted IPs.",
          "Use Active Directory, Kerberos, and DNS instead of WINS where possible.",
          "Enable SMB-signing and NTLMv2 to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.",
          "Tombstone out dynamic WINS entries that aren't desired using WINSCL.exe (available from NT4 SP4).",
        ],
        "notes": [
          "The vulnerability is more easily exploited on Windows 9x clients since they don't use secure channels for domain authentication like Windows NT.",
          "A rogue server doesn't need to be a true domain controller to register itself with WINS and redirect traffic.",
          "The WINS server might return its own address first, which can prevent attacks if the WINS server is also a domain controller.",
          "Hybrid node (H-node) is recommended over pure P-node to provide a fallback mechanism for NetBIOS name resolution if the WINS server is unavailable.",
            "Microsoft considers this a known limitation due to the nature of NetBIOS and WINS, not a 'significant problem'."
