This deserves passing on.  SGI has a patch for the problem, but apparently
hasn't publicized the details.

-------
Subject: irix-6.2 "at -f" vulnerability

The irix-6.2 "at -f" vulnerability was mentioned on BUGTRAQ a while back. [[1]](#1)
Unfortunately SGI has not issued an advisory on this, nor does it appear
in their security patches list at [www.sgi.com](http://www.sgi.com) as of Aug 4, although a
patch *has* been made available.

The patch number is 3184 and those with SGI Surfzone IDs can get it
by searching for "3184" at SGI's web site.  The top-level description
says it is for 6.4, but the patch README mentions 6.2 bugs which are
patched.
