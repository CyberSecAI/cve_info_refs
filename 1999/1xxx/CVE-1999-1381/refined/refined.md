- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `strcpy` and `strcat` functions in the `dbadmin.c` file of dbadmin v1.0.1. These functions do not perform bounds checking, leading to potential buffer overflows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code uses `strcpy` and `strcat` to copy data into fixed-size buffers without checking the length of the input. Specifically, the lines `strcpy(op_temp,curField->name);` and `strcat(rec_new,curField->name);` are identified as potential issues. The large number of `strcat` and `strcpy` calls in the code indicates a systemic weakness.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A buffer overflow could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory locations. While the exact impact depends on the memory layout, it could lead to denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerable code is within a CGI application, `dbadmin`, which is used to administer mSQL databases. The attacker would need to send crafted input (likely via HTTP requests) to the CGI script such that the `curField->name` is longer than the buffer `op_temp` or `rec_new`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the CGI script, which is recommended to be protected via `.htaccess` authentication. However, if an attacker can bypass or gain access they can trigger the overflow. The vulnerability exists in the code regardless of access control, but the impact of exploitation depends on the permissions granted to the cgi application.
