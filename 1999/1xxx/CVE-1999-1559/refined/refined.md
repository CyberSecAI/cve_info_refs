The content relates to CVE-1999-1559.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Xylan OmniSwitches (and Pizza switches) have default configurations that allow unauthorized access via telnet and FTP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Telnet access without credentials:** Anyone can telnet to the switch and reach the login prompt without providing a username or password. While no commands can be executed without logging in, this can be used for a weak denial-of-service (DoS).
2. **FTP access without credentials:** Anyone can FTP to the switch without credentials. This allows for:
    - Reading all files in the flash memory, including SNMP community strings stored in clear text.
    - Uploading files to the switch.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **DoS (Telnet):** The telnet vulnerability can be exploited for a weak DoS by holding up the single interactive session available on the switch.
2. **Information Disclosure (FTP):** Reading files via FTP allows for the disclosure of sensitive information such as SNMP community strings.
3. **Remote code execution (FTP):** The ability to upload files through FTP could potentially be used to introduce malicious files into the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Telnet: Network access to the switch on the telnet port (typically 23).
- FTP: Network access to the switch on the FTP port (typically 21).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have network access to the switch on the telnet and FTP ports.
- No prior authentication is required for either telnet or FTP access.
