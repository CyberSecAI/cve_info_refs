- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `CALL` function in Microsoft Excel 97. This function, designed to call procedures in a dynamic link library (DLL) or code resource, does not generate a warning when used as a worksheet function, unlike when used in macros.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of a warning message when the `CALL` function is executed from a worksheet. This allows an attacker to call an external DLL without user knowledge or consent. This is a case of insufficient security measures for external code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by calling a malicious DLL using the `CALL` function. This could lead to a wide range of attacks, such as malware installation, data theft, or system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector involves embedding a malicious `CALL` function within an Excel spreadsheet and sending it to a victim. The function could be configured to trigger either when the spreadsheet is opened or when a specific event occurs, without warning to the user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create and distribute an Excel spreadsheet containing a malicious `CALL` function, and must have a malicious DLL to be executed. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim, only have the means to distribute the malicious spreadsheet.
