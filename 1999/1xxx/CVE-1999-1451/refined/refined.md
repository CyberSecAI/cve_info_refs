- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `winmsdp.exe` file viewer, included in Microsoft Site Server and Internet Information Server, does not restrict which files a web site visitor can view. This allows a user to potentially view any file on the same disk partition as the currently displayed web page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper file access restrictions within the `winmsdp.exe` file viewer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view (but not change or create) files on the server by guessing or knowing the file names. The attacker needs to have read access permissions to those files based on Windows NT ACLs.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can access the vulnerable file viewer by using a web browser. The attacker must know or guess the name of the file they wish to view and must have the required access rights based on the file system's ACLs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to access the web server hosting the vulnerable file viewers. They must know or guess the file names and have the required file access rights, based on Windows NT ACLs.
