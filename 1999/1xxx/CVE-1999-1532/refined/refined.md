The provided content describes a vulnerability in Netscape Messaging Server 3.6 SP2 for NT related to excessive RCPT TO commands.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the server's inability to handle a large number of RCPT TO commands with long recipient addresses. Repeatedly sending RCPT TO commands with 8000-byte recipient addresses causes the server to allocate memory without releasing it, leading to memory exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Memory exhaustion due to improper handling of multiple RCPT TO commands with long recipient addresses.
- Lack of resource limits or proper memory management for RCPT TO command processing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The server becomes unresponsive and unavailable due to memory exhaustion and high CPU usage.
- Server crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: An attacker sends a large number of RCPT TO commands with excessively long recipient addresses to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the vulnerable server (port 25).
- The attacker can be remote.
- The attacker has the ability to send SMTP commands.

The provided information includes a C code example (rcpt2.c) that demonstrates the vulnerability by sending multiple RCPT TO commands with long recipient addresses. This level of detail exceeds the typical information found in a basic CVE description.
