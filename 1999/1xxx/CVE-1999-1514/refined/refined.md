The content is related to CVE-1999-1514.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the ExpressFS 2.x FTP server. The server does not properly handle excessively long user names in the USER command, leading to a buffer overflow when followed by a PASS command.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The FTP server lacks proper input validation for the USER command, causing a buffer overflow when a long username is provided, followed by the PASS command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: The buffer overflow can cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: In a worst-case scenario, the attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack is conducted over the network via the FTP protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server.
- The attacker needs to send the crafted USER command with a very long username, followed by a PASS command.
