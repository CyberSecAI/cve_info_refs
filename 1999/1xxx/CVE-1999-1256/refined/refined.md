- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Oracle Database Assistant logs the master password in plaintext within the `spoolmain.log` file during database creation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext storage of sensitive information (master password) and insecure file permissions that grant full control to everyone.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to the Oracle database with administrative privileges using the exposed master password.
- **Attack vectors:** Local file system access to the `spoolmain.log` file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the file system of the server where Oracle is installed and to read the log file located at `\orant\database\spoolmain.log`
