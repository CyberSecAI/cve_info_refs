Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the insecure use of the `FileSystemObject` (FSO) in an Active Server Page (ASP) script named `showfile.asp`. The script takes a `file` parameter from the URL, which is then used directly with `Server.MapPath` and `fso.OpenTextFile` to open and display the contents of the specified file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The script does not sanitize or validate the `file` parameter, allowing attackers to use ".." sequences to traverse directories outside the web root (`\InetPub\wwwRoot\`). This allows access to arbitrary files on the server.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  By accessing arbitrary files, attackers can potentially view sensitive data, including source code of other ASP applications, configuration files, and more.
*   **File Overwrite:** Although not directly the vulnerability, the author points out a potential for a small modification to write content into arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Exposure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially gaining access to configuration files, source code, and other sensitive data.
*   **Data Corruption:** By overwriting ASP files of other users, an attacker could cause data corruption and application malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the `file` parameter with path traversal sequences to access files outside the intended web root. Example: `http://www.server.foo/showfile.asp?file=../../global.asa`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   The attacker must be able to identify and access the `showfile.asp` script on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is in the server-side code, not the client-side.
*   The code snippet provided clearly demonstrates the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
* The author mentions that while the TextStream won't execute ASP code (thus avoiding remote code execution), it can still expose the source code.
* The content provides more detail and specific technical context than a typical CVE description might contain, including the exact vulnerable code.
