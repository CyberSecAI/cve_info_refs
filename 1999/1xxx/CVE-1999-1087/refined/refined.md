Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-1999-1087:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer 4 interprets and resolves dotless IP addresses. Specifically, when a URL uses a 32-bit number (e.g., `https://031713501415`) instead of the standard dotted decimal notation (e.g., `https://207.46.131.13`), Internet Explorer incorrectly categorizes the website into the "Local Intranet Zone" instead of the "Internet Zone."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Zone Determination:** Internet Explorer fails to properly identify the correct security zone for dotless IP addresses, misclassifying them as local intranet sites.
- **Bypassing Security Restrictions:** By misrepresenting the URL, a malicious website can bypass the restrictions enforced on Internet Zone or Restricted Sites Zone.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevated Privileges:** The primary impact is that a malicious website could gain privileges normally reserved for local intranet sites. This allows the attacker to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted in the Internet Zone.
- **NTLM Authentication Bypass:** A specific difference between the default settings of the Internet Zone and the Local Intranet Zone is that NTLM challenge response authentication is enabled by default for local intranet machines. A successful exploit could allow a malicious website to leverage NTLM authentication against the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker creates a malicious website using a dotless IP address.
- **User Interaction:** A user visits the malicious website using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Website Hosting:** The attacker needs the capability to host a website and deliver it via a dotless IP address.
- **Target Vulnerability:** The target machine must be using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer 4.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability does not affect Internet Explorer 3 or Internet Explorer 4 for the Macintosh.
- Microsoft released a patch to fix this issue.
- A workaround is available: manually configuring the Intranet Zone settings to be the same as those used by the Internet Zone.
