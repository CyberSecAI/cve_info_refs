Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `aspppd` (a PPP daemon) handles the `.asppp.fifo` file in the `/tmp` directory and its interaction with a potential symbolic link created by a malicious user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **World-Writable FIFO:** When `aspppd` is not running, the file `/tmp/.asppp.fifo` is world-writable.
*   **Symbolic Link Creation:** An attacker can create a symbolic link named `/tmp/.asppp.fifo` pointing to a sensitive file, such as `/.rhosts`.
*   **Uncontrolled File Access:** When `aspppd` starts (as root), it opens `/tmp/.asppp.fifo` (which is now the symbolic link to `/.rhosts`) for read/write as a FIFO. If the link points to a file that is not a FIFO, `aspppd` will handle the file like a normal file, thus exposing its contents to world read/write.
*   **Race condition**: The vulnerability requires the attacker to create the symbolic link before root executes `aspppd`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can gain read/write access to an arbitrary file on the system (in this case, `/.rhosts`). This enables further attacks such as privilege escalation by modifying the `/.rhosts` file, a vulnerability present in older Unix systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  The attacker creates a symbolic link at `/tmp/.asppp.fifo` to the targeted file, such as `/.rhosts`. This is done when `aspppd` is not running
2.  The attacker triggers the execution of `aspppd` (typically by a root user).
3. `aspppd` opens the path pointed by the symbolic link created by the attacker
4. Once `aspppd` stops, the file pointed by the symbolic link becomes a normal world-readable/writable file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have write access to `/tmp`.
*   The attacker must know when `aspppd` is not running to create the symbolic link.
*   The attacker has to know when a root user will execute `aspppd`.
*   The attacker needs to wait for the process to exit so that the symbolic link becomes a regular file.

**Additional Notes:**
* The attack has a race condition where the symbolic link needs to exist before the root user launches `aspppd`
* The vulnerability is not straightforward and may not be exploitable in typical scenarios.
* This vulnerability is specific to older versions of Solaris and `aspppd`.
*  This particular exploit relies on a script used to keep the link up. The author has said he no longer uses it due to its vulnerability.
