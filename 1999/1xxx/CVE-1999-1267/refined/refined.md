- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The KDE file manager communicates with other modules over an unsecured TCP socket.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unsecured TCP socket communication, allowing remote manipulation of file operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially copy files to arbitrary locations on the victim's system, including sensitive areas like `~user/.rhosts`, by sending commands over the unsecured TCP socket.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the unsecured TCP socket used for communication between KDE modules. They also need the ability to get a file onto the victim's machine (e.g. via anonymous FTP).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same network or have network access to the victim's machine.  Additionally, the attacker needs the ability to upload a file to the victim's machine.
