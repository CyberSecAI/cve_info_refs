Here is some additional information since my previous email, below.

The issue involves using the existing SSL certificates to access any
web page on a server and the CPU utilization of passing normal, non-
secure pages containing graphics or whatever sizable information
through SSL.  We have not found a way to limit the use of SSL to only
the designated pages, aside from distributing secure pages to a
separate server only.  This would require a rewrite of our current
application.  Here is the information we have gathered.
We have noticed that if a certificate is applied to a site w/o IP specified,
as is the case with most large sites, https can be used on any page,
containing large graphics and consume alot of CPU.  If this was done as an
attack, could take the server down.

We haven't driven a machine into the ground yet - but we know from
statistics that one SSL session will require about 100x the
processing of 1 normal session.

Here's our real concern:
Malicious User elects to cause a problem at XXX.com.  Our legal
agreements cover our hardware, so most DOS attacks are eliminated,
but Malicious User decides to use one of the freeware load generators
to hit <https://ntserver.target.com/> repeatedly.  The NT server cannot
be set to deny the SSL (or redirect to the non-SSL page), so it bears
the load.  One machine on a reasonably fast internet connection can
stress the web server to such a point that it will not be able to
respond.

Our network layout has 4 identical web servers in the NT web farm.
Portions of these should be handled with SSL on, while most of the
site has no need for secured data.  IIS has no way to limit what
Malicious User can require to have in SSL by just having https
instead of http - the user can request the largest web page with
encrypted images, etc.

Is there another way to limit this?
