Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the inability of IIS (Internet Information Services) to restrict the use of SSL/TLS to specific pages when a certificate is applied to a website without specifying a specific IP address. This means any page on the site can be accessed via HTTPS, even if it doesn't need encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Granular SSL Control:** IIS does not offer the ability to limit SSL usage to only designated pages. Once a certificate is applied to a site, any resource on that site can be accessed through HTTPS.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Processing SSL sessions consumes significantly more CPU resources than normal HTTP requests. This can lead to a Denial-of-Service condition if malicious users repeatedly request large pages via HTTPS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious user can overload the web server by repeatedly requesting large, resource-intensive pages over HTTPS, leading to server unresponsiveness and downtime. This attack exploits the CPU intensive nature of SSL processing.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Even without a full DoS, the excessive use of SSL can degrade the performance of the web server, impacting legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTPS Requests:** The attacker uses a load generator or similar tool to send a large number of HTTPS requests to the target server, specifically requesting large pages with graphics, etc.
*   **Lack of SSL Restriction:** The vulnerability lies in the server's inability to limit SSL to only necessary content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the target server over the network.
*   **Basic Scripting/Tool Knowledge:** The attacker needs to use or create simple tools for generating HTTP requests (load generators).
*   **Knowledge of target server:** The attacker needs to know the address and some information about the target web server to make effective attacks.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided content indicates that one SSL session requires approximately 100 times the processing power of a normal HTTP session. This highlights the severity of the issue.
*   The email also points out that redirecting to the non-SSL version of the page is not an option when an SSL request is made on IIS.
