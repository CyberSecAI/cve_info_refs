The provided content relates to CVE-1999-1398.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `xfsdump` utility creates a log file at `/usr/tmp/bck.log` without being asked to. This is a classic symlink vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Creation of a log file in a shared temporary directory without proper checks.
- Vulnerability to symlink attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation to root. An attacker can exploit the log file creation to overwrite a file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution as root, especially if a SUID binary is targeted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required. An attacker must be able to create a symlink to a file they want to overwrite in the `/usr/tmp` directory before xfsdump is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  Local user access is needed to create symlinks in `/usr/tmp`.
