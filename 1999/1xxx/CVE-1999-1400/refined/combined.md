Subject:    Official response from The Economist re: 1999 Screen Saver

I just got off the phone with Anthony Goetleib (sp?) of The Economist in
the U.K. He told me that his hosting provider, Digex, caught wind of the
issue last night after the message was sent to NTBugtraq. They
immediately pulled the 1999 Screen Saver until they have had an
opportunity to fully investigate the issues (I have since forwarded him
a copy of the NTBugtraq message from Ed Walsh).

Pamela Fusco, Systems Security Operation Manager for Digex, told me that
as soon as she saw the message she had her staff stop availability of
the Screen Saver. Now that's a hosting provider if you ask me.

Good catch by Digex, and The Economist's response has been great too.
All concerned have taken the issue very seriously, and kudos to us all
for being watched so closely.

Now of course if Digex were a member of the NTBugtraq VAN
(<http://ntbugtraq.ntadvice.com/ntbugtraqvan.asp>)...;-]

Cheers,
Russ - NTBugtraq Editor
