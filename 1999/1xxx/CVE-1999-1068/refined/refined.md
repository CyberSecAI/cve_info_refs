Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Vulnerability:** A denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability exists in Oracle Webserver 2.1 when handling PL/SQL stored procedures.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an overly long string of 'a' characters as a parameter in a GET request. The server crashes silently without leaving any logs.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The server does not properly handle excessively long parameters in requests.
*   Lack of input validation or length limitations.
*   Insufficient error handling, leading to a silent crash instead of a graceful error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Denial of Service: The Oracle Webserver 2.1 crashes, becoming unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vector:**
*   Network-based. An attacker can send a malicious request to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the server.
*   They need to know the path to a PL/SQL stored procedure on the server, although a non-existing path can also cause the crash.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by sending a GET request with a long parameter. The provided Perl script demonstrates this:
    ```perl
    perl -e 'print "GET $ARGV[0]/fnord?foo=", "a" x 2600, " HTTP/1.0\n\n\n\n";' "$3"|nc $1 $2
    ```
    Where $1 is the host, $2 is the port, and $3 is the path.
*   The "fnord" part of the path is arbitrary. It does not seem to matter if such a procedure exists or not, as long as the path matches the server's configured mapping to the PL/SQL procedure handler.
