- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `cue` program in HP-UX 10.20 incorrectly uses the `LOGNAME` environment variable to determine the user, instead of relying on the actual user ID. Additionally, the program creates a temporary file (`IOERROR.mytty`) and follows the user's umask, and also follows symlinks when creating that temporary file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    -  Use of `LOGNAME` environment variable instead of the actual user ID for privilege checks.
    -  Creation of a temporary file (`IOERROR.mytty`) with permissions based on the user's umask.
    -  Following symbolic links when creating the temporary file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can manipulate the `LOGNAME` environment variable to mislead the `cue` program into thinking they are another user, and through the program create/overwrite files with permissions determined by the attacker's umask. This allows for the potential overwriting of system binaries, escalating privileges to root. The attacker can overwrite the target file pointed by symlink, thus being able to overwrite system files such as `/etc/passwd`.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Setting the `LOGNAME` environment variable to "root" before executing the `cue` program.
    - Creating symbolic links to system files.
    - Setting umask to a less restrictive value before executing the `cue` program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable `cue` program which has the setuid bit set.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to set environment variables like `LOGNAME`.
    - The attacker needs to have knowledge of the filesystem and be able to create symlinks.
