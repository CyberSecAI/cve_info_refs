Hi all

Tanks for all the mail and all the different approaches to a solution for
my problem.
But I have to say that I liked Marc Albrecht solution? so simple and just
the thing I needed. Can't figure out that MS didn't tips me about this
one?. And for my self, I just have to have coma or something?
Now I only have to implement this in ZAK.
I have only tested this on my home computer and not at work but it seems to
get the job done.  And it shouldn't be a problem to implement this in ZAK.
Thanks Marc J

Here follows Marc's mail

The way to stop the explorer from being an option is to remove it from
under the file association for folders. To do this follow these
directions.

Go to My Computer
Select View and Options
Click on the File Types tab
Find the Folder association and double click to open it
Highlight explore and click Remove

This will remove the explorer option from all right mouse button
calls.

The next area to look at is to give the everyone group Execute rights
only to explorer.exe command. This will allow explorer to run for the
desktop but it will not be available to be added by embedding it into
a Word or Excel document.

Another good are to look at is after you install SP4 there are some
new policies that can keep the user from showing all files. Check out
TechNet for reference to the update.

Hi all

Im working whit a couple of projects that uses ZAK for WinNT 4.0
(SP3) and Office 97
We use ZAK in "Appstation" mode.
Now the only ZAK "security hole?" Office "bug?" that the users have
discovered and we have been unable to plug is the following.
When you are in some Office application ex. Word click on the Open
dialog box, now right click on the Open dialog boxs background and
you get a dialog with Explore.
Choose this "explore", and you have a perfectly working Explorer.
The harddrive is hidden with a Policy entry and the ZAK
installation has run the ACLS.CMD and HIDE.CMD. (Note: ACLS.CMD is modified like \
described in Q182367) But in your newly opened Explorer you can take the Go to dialog \
and write C: then OK now you choose to show all files.
Ok what can you do when everything is locked? Go to C:\TEMP or you can create your \
own directory, copy your favorite program or Game here and change the executable file \
name to ex. Winword.exe. This have to be done or the policy Run only allowed apps \
will stop you....  All off this the kids at the school has figured out :-( learning \
fast Eh? And I can tell you that they are using it... Quake runs well on a WinNT \
machine...

I have contacted Microsoft and after a couple of weeks they tell me
that they cant help me. And if I want to close this hole I have to
write an app that sniffs system calls from the Office programs and if
there is a call after this imbedded Explorer then the app should stop
this. Hmmm well I am kind off stuck here.... I cant program at all, Eh!
Ok well some batch "programming" but I dont think it will help me in this case.
Does anyone have a solution to this problem or do I have to give up all
hope of finding one (Ok I could read a book about C++ use Spy to sniff system calls \
and make an app, but I dont have the time to do this.) Or is it me, have I missed \
something? I have applied everything that I have found in TechNet whit no success
