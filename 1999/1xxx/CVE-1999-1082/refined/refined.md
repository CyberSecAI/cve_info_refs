The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Jana 1.0 webserver.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The web server does not properly handle path traversal sequences ( "../" ) in the URL, allowing access to files outside of the intended web root directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access and read arbitrary files on the server's file system, potentially exposing sensitive information. In the specific example, the attacker is able to read the `autoexec.bat` file.

**Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable server with a path containing traversal sequences, for example, `http://server/....../autoexec.bat`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges are required.
