- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in StackGuard's previous canary implementation allows an attacker to overwrite a pointer on the stack and redirect it to an arbitrary memory location, including the return address, bypassing the canary protection mechanism.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - StackGuard's Random and Terminator Canary mechanisms assume a linear attack, where an attacker overflows a buffer on the stack and moves up in memory through the canary word to reach the return address.
    - The vulnerability allows an attacker to change the value of a pointer, redirecting it to an arbitrary memory location, including the return address, without having to overwrite the canary.
    - The `gets()` function is used which does not perform any boundary checks, allowing for buffer overflows.

- **Impact of exploitation:** By overwriting the return address, an attacker can redirect the program's execution flow to malicious code, leading to arbitrary code execution.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack involves overflowing a buffer to overwrite a pointer to a location of the attacker's choice.
    - Then another buffer can be overflowed through the attacker controlled pointer.
    - An attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable program.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable program, particularly input that can cause a buffer overflow.
    - The attacker needs to know how the stack is laid out to be able to point the overwritten pointer to the return address.
