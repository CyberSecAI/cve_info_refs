## Wang/Kodak Image Admin ActiveX Control

#### Vulnerability Note VU#26924

Original Release Date: 2000-10-31 | Last Revised: 2000-10-31

---

### Overview

### Description

| The Image Admin control is incorrectly marked safe for scripting. This control is sometimes identified as from "Kodak" and other times as from "Wang". The Image Admin control is one of several controls used to provide image editting services through a web site. Because the control is marked safe-for-scripting, an attacker may be able to script this control and exploit the vulnerability when you visit a web page.  This control is implemented in the file imgadmin.ocx and has a ClassID of {009541A0-3B81-101C-92F3-040224009C02}.This vulnerability is closely related to these vulnerabilities:     + VU#26924 Wang/Kodak Image Admin ActiveX Control + VU#41408 Wang/Kodak Image Scan ActiveX Control + VU#23412 Wang/Kodak Image Edit/Annotation ActiveX Control + VU#24839 Wang/Kodak Image Thumbnail ActiveX Control + VU#9162 Wang/Kodak Image Edit ActiveX Control  Each of these controls appears to have a similar problem. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can use the control to create files on a system viewing a malicious web page. By carefully constructing the files and specfying which files to overwrite, an attacker can cause arbitrary commands to be execued. The attacker can also overwrite existing files, causing the system to fail. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Apply the patch provided by Microsoft in [Security Bulletin MS99-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-037.asp). This patch sets the kill bit which prevents the control from being loaded by Internet Explorer. |
| --- |

| **Disable "Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting"**In your Internet Explorer security settings, set this option to "disable" or "prompt". |

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-037 - Critical

## Patch Available for "ImportExportFavorites" Vulnerability

Published: September 10, 1999 | Updated: December 08, 1999

**Version:** 1.3

**Originally Posted:** September 10, 1999

**Re-released:** September 24, 1999

**Revised:** December 08, 1999

**Summary**

On September 10, 1999, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin, in order to provide a workaround for a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 5 that could allow a malicious web site operator to take inappropriate action on the computer of a person who visited the site. Microsoft has completed a patch that completely eliminates the vulnerability, and has re-released this bulletin in order to advise customers of its availability. In addition to eliminating the "ImportExportFavorites" vulnerability, the patch also eliminates a security vulnerability posed by several ActiveX controls that ship as part of Internet Explorer 4.01 and 5.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-037.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-037)

**Issue**

IE 5 includes a feature that allows users to export a list of their favorite web sites to a file, or to import a file containing a list of favorite sites. The method that is used to perform this function, ImportExportFavorites(), should only allow particular types of files to be written, and only to specific locations on the drive. However, it is possible for a web site to invoke this method, bypass this restriction and write files that could be used to execute system commands. The net result is that a malicious web site operator potentially could take any action on the computer that the user would be capable of taking.

This vulnerability would chiefly affect workstations that are connected to the Internet. The patch restores correct operation to the ImportExportFavorites() method. In addition, the patch addresses security problems posed by several ActiveX controls. The specific controls and the actions taken are discussed in the FAQ.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 and 5

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0702](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0702)

**Patch Availability**

## Wang/Kodak Image Edit ActiveX control

#### Vulnerability Note VU#9162

Original Release Date: 2000-10-31 | Last Revised: 2005-08-29

---

### Overview

### Description

| The Image Edit control is incorrectly marked safe for scripting. This control is sometimes identified as from "Kodak" and other times as from "Wang". The Image Edit control is one of several controls used to provide image editting services through a web site. Because the control is marked safe-for-scripting, an attacker may be able to script this control and exploit the vulnerability when you visit a web page.  This control is implemented in the file imgedit.ocx and has a ClassID of {6D940280-9F11-11CE-83FD-02608C3EC08A}.This vulnerability is closely related to these vulnerabilities:     + VU#26924 Wang/Kodak Image Admin ActiveX Control + VU#41408 Wang/Kodak Image Scan ActiveX Control + VU#23412 Wang/Kodak Image Annotation ActiveX Control + VU#24839 Wang/Kodak Image Thumbnail ActiveX Control + VU#9162 Wang/Kodak Image Edit ActiveX Control  Each of these controls appears to have a similar problem. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can use the control to create files on a system viewing a malicious web page. By carefully constructing the files and specfying which files to overwrite, an attacker can cause arbitrary commands to be executed. The attacker can also overwrite existing files, causing the system to fail. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch**Apply the patch provided by Microsoft in [Security Bulletin MS99-037](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-037.asp). This patch sets the kill bit which prevents the control from being loaded by Internet Explorer. |
| --- |

| **Disable "Script ActiveX controls marked safe for scripting"**In your Internet Explorer security settings, set this option to "disable" or "prompt". |
