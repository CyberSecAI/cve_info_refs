# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS98-017 - Important

## Patch Available for 'Named Pipes Over RPC' Issue

Published: November 20, 1998 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** November 19, 1998

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that fixes a vulnerability in the way Windows NT Â® 4.0 handles named pipes over the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) services. An attacker could create a denial of service situation on a Windows NT 4.0 system by opening multiple named pipe connections to RPC services and sending random data.

A fully supported fix for this problem is available. As detailed below in What Customers Should Do, Microsoft recommends that customers evaluate the risk that this vulnerability poses to their systems and apply the patch if appropriate.

**Issue**

The underlying problem is the way that Windows NT 4.0 attempts to shut down invalid named pipe RPC connections. An attacker could exploit this problem to create a denial of service condition by opening multiple named pipe connections and sending random data. When the RPC service attempts to close the invalid connections, the service consumes all CPU resources and memory use grows considerably, which may result in the system hanging. This is a denial of service vulnerability only; there is no risk of compromise or loss of data from the attacked system.

Different attack programs may target different system services. Two of the services typically targeted are the SPOOLSS and LSASS system service processes.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-1127](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-1127)

**What Microsoft is Doing**

On November 19 Microsoft released a patch that fixes the problem identified. This patch is available for download from the sites listed below.
