- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Windows NT 4.0 attempts to shut down invalid named pipe RPC connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system fails to properly handle invalid named pipe RPC connections, leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can create a denial-of-service condition by opening multiple named pipe connections to RPC services and sending random data. When the RPC service tries to close the invalid connections, it consumes excessive CPU resources and memory, potentially causing the system to hang.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by opening multiple named pipe connections to RPC services and sending random data over these connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to establish named pipe connections to the vulnerable system's RPC services. This could potentially be achieved remotely if the RPC service is exposed over a network.
