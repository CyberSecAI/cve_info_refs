- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When a port is configured with "set host prompt", the configured access filters (ifilter) are ignored. This allows dial-up users to bypass configured restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the access filter logic where it fails to apply the configured filters when the "set host prompt" command is used. This is an implementation bug that makes the access filters ineffective.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass configured access filters, initiating unauthorized telnet sessions to internal hosts, even if they're not in the allowed hosts list, which can lead to further exploitation. This bypass could allow unauthorized access to the network or allow an attacker to use the vulnerable system as a relay.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a dial-up connection to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to dial into the vulnerable system and the knowledge to type a hostname twice at the prompt.
