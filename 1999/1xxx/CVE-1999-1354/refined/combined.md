Mr. Litchfield is correct. However, the documentation recommends that the user
NOT store their userid and password in the settings document (the " *.fc "
files referred to below). If it is stored, then anyone with physical access to
the client computer will be able to access the user's account on the FirstClass
Server. It is very much like saving your POP3 password in Outlook and then
giving someone use of your computer while you are away from the console.

All versions of FirstClass client software are affected. We presently have no
plans to change this.

The account information can be saved to any FirstClass setting document. Again,
it is not recommended that anyone save password information for any protected
application where the client console is accessible to untrusted persons. This
is especially true where the user is an administrator of a system.

We are quite confident in the security of our products. No one, to our
knowledge, has ever "hacked" into a FirstClass server that has proper
passwording in place.

I have included the text of a document (below) that gives an overview of why
FirstClass is a secure email environment.

If you have any further concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to
contact me or Jeff Parker <jeff@softarc.com> in my absence.

FirstClass and Security Concerns
FirstClass is designed as an extremely secure communications system.  This
document describes some of the strategies FirstClass utilizes to provide a
secure medium for sensitive corporate communications.

Today as organizations invite their customers, vendors and even the general
public to participate in electronic workgroup communications one of their most
important concerns is security.

User Account Security:
Every user's UserID and Password is distinct and unrelated to each other, or
to the name of the user online. This makes it far more difficult to hack into a
user's mail account.  With most e-mail systems logins are accomplished using
the mail address, which is public.

FirstClass offers packet-level encryption, every piece of data is encrypted .
FirstClass uses a fast stream-level cipher on the packets as they are
transmitted. To ensure that each stream is uniquely encrypted, a random
challenge-response is performed at link negotiation time. Due to real-time
computational limitations on a high speed stream the cipher is not as
cryptographically strong as something like RSA, but is still very difficult to
break.

Almost all network applications, from file sharing to printing to mail expose
content directly to anyone utilizing a simple packet analyzer program.  Packet
level encryption is inherent to FirstClass and, as such, works regardless of
whether the system is communicating using TCP/IP, IPX, AppleTalk or even by
modem.

Content/Conference Security:
Unlike most mail systems,  FirstClass offers a complete User and Group access
control system, and provides this at both the system and the conference level.
It is possible to control access to specific information, conferences, and
folders extremely tightly, by allowing the administrator to assign discreet
levels of access permissions for individual users, or groups, based on their
requirements.  An individual's access is secured through their unique User ID
and Password which, as discussed above, is difficult to compromise.

FirstClass and Network Security:
Security risks, from outside the local area network, are generally associated
with a remote access solution such as remote IPX or TCP/IP routers, ARA and
terminal servers.  These can easily expose a network to outside and potentially
damaging access.

FirstClass is an excellent network firewall.
FirstClass allows connections directly to the server machine via both direct
modem and remote TCP/IP protocols.  There is no method for such a connection to
bypass the server machine, access the network or access anything other than the
FirstClass server, as controlled by the users' permissions.

In the event that a user has gained knowledge of the Administrator's password
(perhaps through observing the login process or other physical means) there is
still no facility to have access to the server machine's file structure or the
network.

One of the reasons for this is that FirstClass employs entirely proprietary
protocols that are designed to run on top of inherently secure operating
systems.  Windows NT and the Macintosh O/S (both used as FirstClass servers)
are not susceptible to the intrusive O/S level access provided by Unix
operating systems, which can effectively be reprogrammed over a remote
connection.

With FirstClass, users are completely locked into an environment that cannot be
accessed or bypassed from within that environment.  If a user, in an attempt to
break in, were to attempt to bypass FirstClass by somehow disabling FirstClass
(which is not something FirstClass is susceptible to), the user would be
instantly disconnected when the server ceased working.  FirstClass, because it
handles all of the communication protocols internally, is the only element
handling the connection and no connection will exist when it ceases to function.

The FirstClass Post Office files all reside on locked volumes, so the files
themselves cannot be accessed from the network, except when logged in as a
FirstClass user.  This, as discussed above, strictly controls the level of file
access.  This contrasts with several well-known e-mail products that require
that their mail users have read AND write access to their post office files
that must reside on an accessible volume on the file server.  This allows
completely free ability to edit, corrupt or even delete select files.  The
standard method suggested to protect against this eventuality is to frequently
back up the files in question so that restoration is more easily accomplished.
While providing some protection against data loss, this in no way prevents
intruders from gaining access to the information contained within the mail
system.

Physical Security:
True security requires that the server machine and associated hard drives be
physically inaccessible.   It is easily possible to retrieve information from
any hard drive, if the perpetrator can gain physical access to the server for a
protracted period of time.

SoftArc's own internal FirstClass system, SoftArc Online, is used for both
internal communications and for support of a body of approximately 10,000
remote users.  These individuals connect to SoftArc Online either via direct
modem, or over TCP/IP from the internet.  SoftArc is entirely confident in
FirstClass' ability to protect our sensitive internal communications, regarding
our product, directions and development from any outside intrusion.

  Any mail, upon leaving FirstClass using either the UUCP or SMTP internet
protocols become vulnerable to interception.

SoftArc (<http://www.softarc.com>) produce FirstClass Intranet Server and the
client software used to access the server. The UserID and password to
connect to the server are stored in clear text by the e-mail client in the
relevant
*.fc file.

Versions known to do this are 5.506 (the most up to date version) and 3.5.
Other versions are likely to have this problem too.

5.506 stores the account information in the
%FirstClassInstallDirectory%\Settings\home.fc
file and 3.5 in the %FirstClassInstallDirectory%\Settings\network.fc file.
