The provided content describes vulnerabilities in several security tools: Satan v1.1.1, cops v1.04, and tiger v2.2.3, due to insecure temporary file handling. These issues stem from the use of predictable temporary file names and locations, which can lead to race conditions and allow attackers to create or overwrite files on the system.

**Satan v1.1.1:**
*   **Root cause:** The `rex.satan` script creates a temporary file in `/tmp` with a predictable name (`/tmp/rex.$$`).
*   **Weakness:**  The use of `/tmp` makes the file susceptible to race conditions. An attacker could create a symlink with the same name, redirecting the output to an arbitrary file.
*  **Impact:** Allows arbitrary file creation/overwriting. This could result in denial of service and potentially root compromise.
*   **Attack vector:**  Local attacker, race condition on temporary file creation.
*   **Required capabilities:**  Ability to create files/symlinks in `/tmp`.

**Cops v1.04:**
*   **Root cause:** Several scripts use predictable temporary file names in `/tmp` (`/tmp/tmp.$$.foo`, `/tmp/tmp.$$.bar`, `/tmp/makedots${THISSHELL}`, `/usr/tmp/mchk.p$$`, `/usr/tmp/mchk.t$$`).
*  **Weakness:** The use of predictable tmp files and directories makes it susceptible to race conditions, including symlink attacks. In the case of `ca.src`, `touch` command follows symlink, allowing arbitrary file creation.
*   **Impact:** Allows arbitrary file creation and overwriting. This could result in denial of service, including .nologin file to prevent logins and potentially root compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Local attacker, race condition on temporary file creation, symlink following in touch.
*   **Required capabilities:** Ability to create files/symlinks in `/tmp` and `/usr/tmp`.

**Tiger v2.2.3:**
*   **Root cause:** The default working directory `$WORKDIR` is set to `/tmp`, and many temporary files are created there.
*   **Weakness:** The use of `/tmp` as the default working directory allows race conditions, allowing an attacker to overwrite or create files by replacing them with symlinks, similar to other tools.
*   **Impact:** Allows arbitrary file creation and overwriting. This could result in denial of service, and potentially a root compromise.
*   **Attack vector:** Local attacker, race condition on temporary file creation.
*   **Required capabilities:** Ability to create files/symlinks in `/tmp`.

The provided text includes patches for these issues that include the following fixes:
*   **Satan:** The temporary file is created in the current directory (`./rex.$$`).
*   **Cops:** The scripts now use a unique subdirectory in `/tmp` or `/usr/tmp` created with a `umask 077` to mitigate the race condition, the use of relative paths is also avoided, and the temporary directory is removed after use.
*   **Tiger:** The default working directory is changed to `$TIGER_HOME/tmp`, and the directory is created if it doesn't exist.
