{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Microsoft SNMP agent (snmp.exe) does not properly free memory when it cannot decode an OID (Object Identifier) from a network packet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to improper resource management when handling undecodable OIDs in SNMP packets."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor can cause a denial or degradation of service by crafting SNMP packets with undecodable OIDs. This will consume memory on the vulnerable system, leading to resource exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks via crafted SNMP packets."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send SNMP packets to the vulnerable system. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."

    "product": "Microsoft SNMP agent (snmp.exe)",
