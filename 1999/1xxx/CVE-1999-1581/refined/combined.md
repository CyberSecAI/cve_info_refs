## Windows NT SNMP agent leaks memory

#### Vulnerability Note VU#4923

Original Release Date: 2001-11-15 | Last Revised: 2001-11-15

---

### Overview

The Microsoft SNMP agent, prior to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0, will leak memory.

### Description

| Microsoft's SNMP agent, snmp.exe, priot to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0, will leak memory if the OID cannot be decoded. Quoting from [Microsoft KB article Q178381](http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q178/3/81.asp),  *If SNMP cannot decode an OID from a network packet, SNMP does not free up the memory, resulting in a memory leak in the Snmp.exe processes. The impact of this leak will be more evident on a system running on a network segment that receive lots of SNMP broadcast traffic.* An intruder can craft a malicious SNMP packet and consume memory on a victim host. This problem was addressed by Microsoft in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 4. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Intruders can consume memory on vulnerable machines, causing denial or degredation of service. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Upgrade to Windows NT service pack 4 or later, as described in <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q178/3/81.asp>. |
