I didn't see this, or anything similar to it in the archives, but please
forgive me if it's well known:

If a Solaris 2.6 host is a NIS+ client, and any user other than root is
running CDE at the console, CDE's screen locking feature does not work.
Any random string is sufficient to unlock to console. Obviously, this is
not a root-compromise-from-the-network sort of bug, but it can be a
problem if your machine is located somewhere physically insecure
(university labs, for example). I made Sun aware of this a month ago, and
there seems to be a bug ID opened by someone else even farther back (bug
id 4115685).  This is not fixed in any current release (up through
Hardware 5/98 w/current patches). I don't have older versions to test this
on, but I can reproduce it running 2.6 on a variety of hardware (email me
if you care).

Workaround: use /usr/openwin/bin/xlock instead of CDE's screenlock, stop
using NIS+, stop using CDE.
