SCO Advisory 94:001
November 30th, 1994
Patches for at(C), login(M), prwarn(C), sadc(ADM), pt\_chmod
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Santa Cruz Operation has been informed of the following problems present
in our software.
I. Description
The programs at(C), login(M), prwarn(C) sadc(ADM), and pt\_chmod
may each allow unauthorized root access to the system.
There are four unrelated issues present, one for each program listed
above.
II. Impact
Any user with an account on the system may obtain root access using
any one of the programs listed.
III. Releases
These problems exist on the following releases of SCO Products:
SCO Unix System V/386 Release 3.2 Versions 4.2, 4.1, and 4.0
SCO Open Desktop Lite Release 3.0
SCO Open Desktop Release 3.0 and 2.0
SCO Open Server Network System Release 3.0
SCO Open Server Enterprise System Release 3.0
IV. Solution
SCO is providing the following (S)ystem (S)ecurity (E)nhancements, SSEs,
to address these problems. These are preliminary patches which SCO
feels addresses the issues at hand, but these patches have not been
fully tested and integrated and hence cannot officially be supported.
Official patches should be available in the near future via a
(S)upport (L)evel (S)upplement. (SLS). The README file mentioned below
will be updated when an official Supplement is available.

- -------------------------- Here is the ftp.sco.com:/SSE/README file -----
Welcome to the System Security Enhancement (SSE) Area
- ----------------------------------------------------
The System Security Enhancement directory, (SSE), is here to
provide timely fixes to problems with system security. Binaries
acquired from this directory are to be considered preliminary fixes
only, and have not been fully tested or integrated. As such, these
patches are not officially supported. They are provided as a timely
response to security concerns that have been brought to the
attention of The Santa Cruz Operation.
When final, approved patches are available, usually by a Support Level
Supplement, the README files below will be modified to indicate the
existence of the finalized version of the supplement.
SCO reserves the right to change the contents of these supplements at any
time.
The format of the Supplements found here are as follows:
ssexxx.tar.Z - a compressed tar file
ssexxx.ltr.Z - cover letter, release information,
and installation instructions
where xxx indicates the number of the supplement.
Please note that the ssexxx.tar.Z files are \*not\* diskette images.
After downloading an SSE, uncompress both the tar file and the cover
letter. For example, if you were trying to install SSE001, after
downloading sse001.tar.Z and ssexxx.ltr.Z, you would uncompress
both files:
# uncompress ssexxx.tar.Z
# uncompress ssexxx.ltr.Z
After uncompressing both files, you should then follow the instructions
provided in the sse001.ltr file for installation instructions.
These Supplements should be available in the following locations:
