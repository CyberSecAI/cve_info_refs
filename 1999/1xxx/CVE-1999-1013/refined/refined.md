- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `named-xfer` utility on AIX has the SUID bit set, causing it to run with root privileges even when executed by non-root users within the system group. When used with the `-f` option, `named-xfer` writes the resulting zone file to a specified location before relinquishing its root privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - SUID bit set on `named-xfer` which allows users in the system group to execute it with root privileges.
    - `named-xfer` does not drop root privileges before writing the zone file to disk.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary content, as they control the zone file that `named-xfer` writes. This can lead to:
    - Root access by creating a `.rhosts` file in the root user's home directory allowing remote login via rlogin.
    - Overwriting `/etc/passwd` or even the kernel.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker must be a member of the `system` group on an AIX system
    - The attacker then executes `named-xfer` with the `-f` option, specifying a target file and the malicious zone data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Must be a member of the `system` group on a vulnerable AIX system.
    - Needs to be able to provide an arbitrary zone file to the `named-xfer` utility via the `-f` option.
