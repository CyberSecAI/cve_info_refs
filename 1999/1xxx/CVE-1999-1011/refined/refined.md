Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-1999-1011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe methods exposed by the RDS DataFactory object, a component of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC). This object allows for implicit remoting of data access requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Data Access:** The RDS DataFactory object, when installed on a system running Internet Information Server (IIS), allows unauthorized web users to access OLE DB data sources available to the server.
*   **SQL Injection:**  Attackers can use the DataFactory to execute SQL commands against ODBC-compliant databases using the server's installed drivers. This includes the ability to specify a remote SQL server, user credentials, and a database query.
*   **Command Execution:** With specific OLE DB providers (like "Microsoft DataShape Provider" and "Microsoft JET OLE DB provider"), attackers could execute shell commands on the IIS server.
*   **Data Tunneling:** On multi-homed IIS servers, MDAC can be used to tunnel SQL and other ODBC data requests from a public connection to a private back-end network.
*   **File Access:**  Unauthorized access to secured, non-published files on the IIS system is possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can perform privileged actions on the IIS server, including the execution of shell commands with elevated privileges.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data residing in databases accessible to the server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Command execution could lead to server compromise, including denial of service or complete system control.
*   **Network Exposure:** Attackers can exploit data tunneling to gain access to internal resources through the compromised server.
*   **Access to non-public Files:** Attackers can gain access to files that are not meant to be public.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Requests:** The primary attack vector is through web requests to the vulnerable IIS server, leveraging the RDS DataFactory object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IIS server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the RDS DataFactory vulnerability and how to exploit it.
*   **Server Knowledge (Optional):** Some attacks are more effective with inside information such as SQL server names, accounts, and database names.

**Affected Software:**

*   Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 1.5 and 2.0
*   MDAC 2.1 if installed as an upgrade from a previous version.
*   Any version of MDAC if Sample Pages for RDS are installed
*   Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 and 4.0

**Mitigation:**

*   Disable the implicit remoting functionality of the RDS through the DataFactory object by removing the specified registry entries.
*   Remove sample files related to RDS
*   Configure customized handlers for requests to RDS server and implement stricter rules on data access and shell command execution

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported in MS98-004 and was later re-released as MS99-025 to emphasize the need for addressing it.
*   The issue can be addressed with configuration changes rather than a patch
*   The problem is compounded if the database administrator uses blank or easy-to-guess passwords
