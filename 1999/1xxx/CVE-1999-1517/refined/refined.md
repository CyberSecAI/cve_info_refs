The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Amanda backup package, specifically within the `runtar` program. This is not directly related to CVE-1999-1517, which is a placeholder. However, the content provides information about security issues.

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **`runtar` running `tar` with root privileges:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `runtar` program, which is setuid root, directly executes the `/usr/bin/tar` command, passing all its arguments.
    *   **Weakness:**  This allows a regular user to execute `tar` with root privileges by simply invoking `runtar` with the desired `tar` arguments.
    *   **Impact:**  A user can use `tar` to archive/extract any file, including sensitive files such as `/etc/master.passwd`, with root privileges, leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Executing the `runtar` binary with manipulated arguments.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Any user with access to the system can execute the `runtar` binary.

2.  **Buffer Overflow in `tar`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `tar` program itself has a buffer overflow vulnerability.
    *   **Weakness:** By passing an overly long string to `runtar`, which then passes it to `tar`, an attacker can cause a buffer overflow in `tar`.
    *   **Impact:**  This overflow allows execution of arbitrary code as root.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Passing a long string to `runtar` which is then passed to `tar`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:**  Any user with access to the system can execute the `runtar` binary.

3.  **Symlink Vulnerability:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `amandad` daemon creates a file named `amandad.debug` in `/tmp`.
    *   **Weakness:** A user can create a symbolic link from `/tmp/amandad.debug` to any other file on the system.
    *   **Impact:** When the `amandad` daemon runs, it will overwrite the target file with its debug information. This could lead to denial of service or potentially other impacts depending on the overwritten file.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Creating a symlink at `/tmp/amandad.debug`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Any user can create files in `/tmp`

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided exploit code targets the buffer overflow in `tar` 1.11.2.
* The vulnerabilities are described as existing in Amanda versions 2.3.0 and 2.4.1 on FreeBSD 3.3.
* The report suggests that other operating systems with similar packaging may be vulnerable (RedHat, TurboLinux, PowerTools CD, SuSE 6.2)
