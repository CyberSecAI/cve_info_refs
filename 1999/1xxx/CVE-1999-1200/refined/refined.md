The provided content relates to CVE-1999-1200.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the handling of the `expn` command in the Vintra systems Mailserver software, which is based on sendmail. When a remote user sends an `expn` command with an invalid argument (e.g., `expn *@`), the software enters an infinite loop, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is the lack of proper input validation or error handling when processing the `expn` command, causing an infinite loop.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Specifically:
- The MTA process consumes excessive CPU resources (up to 99%).
- The MTA process consumes all available memory.
- The MTA process fills up disk space.
- Overall, the mail server becomes unresponsive and unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can connect to the mail server via port 25 (SMTP) and send specific commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to connect to the target mail server's port 25 and send SMTP commands. No authentication or special privileges are required. The attacker can be a remote unauthenticated user.
