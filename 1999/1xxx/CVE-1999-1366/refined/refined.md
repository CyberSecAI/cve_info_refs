- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Weak encryption algorithm used by Pegasus Mail to store POP3 passwords in the `pmail.ini` configuration file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The encryption algorithm is extremely simple and predictable.
    - The encrypted password is the same length as the plaintext password.
    - The encryption algorithm is consistent across different versions.
    - The configuration file (`pmail.ini`) is world-readable/writable by default.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker can easily decrypt stored POP3 passwords.
    - An attacker can read and potentially modify the mail configuration settings (such as redirection of mail, disabling deletion of mail on host) by modifying the `pmail.ini` configuration file.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access to the file system of a machine running Pegasus Mail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to access the `pmail.ini` file on the victim's machine.
