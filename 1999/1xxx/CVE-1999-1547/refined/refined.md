The provided content describes a vulnerability in Oracle Web Listener where URL encoding can bypass access controls.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Oracle Web Listener fails to properly normalize URL encoded characters when evaluating access control rules. Specifically, it does not recognize URL encoded representations of underscores (`%5f`) and periods (`%2e`) as the same as their unencoded counterparts when evaluating permissions to access resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper URL normalization
- Inconsistent access control enforcement

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to restricted resources, specifically the `owa_util` package.
- Ability to execute database queries via `showsource`, `cellsprint`, `tableprint`, and `listprint`.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted HTTP requests with URL encoded characters (`%5f` and `%2e`) in the resource path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the Oracle Web Listener.
- Knowledge of the restricted resource path and ability to craft HTTP requests.

The content provides more detail than the typical CVE description by specifying the vulnerable components (Oracle Web Listener), the specific encoding bypass (`%5f`, `%2e`), and examples of exploitation (via `showsource`, etc.).
