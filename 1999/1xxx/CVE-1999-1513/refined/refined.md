- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The 3Com SuperStack II hubs MIB exposes a table of SNMP communities (including read-write and read-only) through an OID (.1.3.6.1.4.1.43.10.4.2) that is accessible using a read-only community.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the exposure of sensitive information (SNMP community strings) through a read-only community. This violates the principle of least privilege and allows unauthorized access to configuration data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially obtain read-write SNMP community strings. This would allow them to reconfigure the device, potentially disrupting network operations, or conduct a variety of malicious attacks through the SNMP interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network by sending SNMP requests using the read-only community to the specific OID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable 3Com SuperStack II hub on the network, and have knowledge of the read-only SNMP community string, which is usually a public default string.
