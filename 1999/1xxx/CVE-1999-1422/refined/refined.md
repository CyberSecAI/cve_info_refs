The content relates to CVE-1999-1422.

Root cause of vulnerability:
The default PATH environment variable in Slackware 2.0.35 includes ".:" (current directory) which allows for the possibility of executing malicious scripts if a user places a trojan in a writable directory and the root user executes a command with the same name from that directory.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Inclusion of "." (current directory) in the root user's default PATH.

Impact of exploitation:
- A user could place a malicious script (e.g., a trojan) in a writable directory that could be executed as root if the root user attempts to execute a command with the same name from that directory.
- Privilege escalation to root by planting a SUID copy of bash via a script.

Attack vectors:
- An attacker places a malicious script with a command name (e.g., "mroe") in a directory writable by them.
- If the root user attempts to execute the command by typing the name from that directory, the attacker's script will execute instead of the original command, allowing for privilege escalation

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to have the ability to write to at least one directory that is writable to them
- The attacker must be able to predict a command that root would execute by name.
