### thttpd - tiny/turbo/throttling HTTP server

[Fetch the software.](thttpd-2.29.tar.gz) [Release notes.](#releasenotes)

![IPv6](/resources/images/ipv6-ready.gif)

thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.

 Simple:
It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.
Well, maybe a little more than the minimum.

 Small:
See the [comparison chart](benchmarks.html).
It also has a very small run-time size, since it does not fork and
is very careful about memory allocation.

 Portable:
It compiles cleanly on most any Unix-like OS, specifically including
FreeBSD, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, BSD/OS, Linux, OSF.

 Fast:
In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers
(Apache, NCSA, Netscape).
Under extreme load it's much faster.

 Secure:
It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine against
attacks and breakins from other sites.

It also has one extremely useful feature
([URL-traffic-based throttling](thttpd_man.html#THROTTLING))
that no other server currently has.
Plus, it supports
[IPv6](http://www.ipv6.org/)
out of the box, no patching required.

How do you pronounce thttpd? Ask Bloom County's Bill the Cat, as seen in
[User Friendly](http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19990926&mode=classic),
the excellent geek-positive comic.

~~Are you using thttpd?
There's a mailing list:
thttpd@mail.acme.com
(thttpd-request@mail.acme.com
to subscribe,
[archived here](https://marc.info/?l=thttpd&r=1&w=2)).
And an announcements-only mailing list:

Anything sent to the announcements list also goes to the regular list,
so you don't need to be on both.~~

Also if you have any nice quotes I can use, send 'em in.

New in version 2.29:

* Allow CGI to handle HTTP methods besides GET/HEAD/POST.

New in version 2.28:

* Improvements to the FreeBSD startup script. (Craig Leres)
* Minor portability tweak in mmc.c.
* Fix to buffer overrun bug in htpasswd. Reported by Alessio Santoru as CVE-2017-17663.

New in version 2.27:

* Stats syslogs changed from LOG\_INFO to LOG\_NOTICE.
* Use memmove() for self-overlapping string copies instead of strcpy().
* Couple of subroutine name changes for consistency.

New in version 2.26:

* Ignore ECONNABORTED on accept().
* Correctly implemented the config-file option change from "nosymlink" to "nosymlinkcheck", which was supposedly done in version 2.24.
* Removed mailto: link from default index page.
* Allow CGIs to provide both Location and Status headers. (A. Skrobov)
* Better logic for figuring out CGI SERVER\_NAME environment variable. (Oleg)
* Updated for clang, and general cleanup.

New in version 2.25b:

* Move fdwatch initialization before the chroot, so that /dev/poll can work.
* Multiple fdwatch cleanups and fixes (Adam Zell).

New in version 2.25:

* Prohibit "Host: ." and "Host: .." (David Leadbeater).
* Don't free memory prematurely on SIGUSR1 (A.D.F.).
* Use the specified charset in directory listings and errors (Jonas Ohlsson).
* Lowered THROTTLE\_TIME from 60 seconds to 2 seconds, plus more aggressive computation of sending rate, to improve throttle reaction time (E Frank Ball).
* Added code to redistribute the throttled bandwidth fairly among the currently sending connections.
* Some more throttling changes that smooth things out a lot.
* Added an experimental limitation on the number of simultaneous CGIs.
* Chown the log file when starting as root, so that it can later be re-opened when running as nobody (or whatever user you configure). Also tweak the logfile pathname so that it still works inside a chroot tree.
* Make sure URL paths begin with a slash.
* Generate multiple MIME encodings in the correct order, and with the correct separator.
* Ignore EINTR on read() and write().
* Fix error in httpd\_read\_fully() and httpd\_write\_fully() that could cause incorrect data to be read or written (Daniel Jensen).
* Don't attempt to double-free a file descriptor if a connection times out while it is paused for throttling.
* Save and restore errno in signal handlers.
* The non-local referer check is no longer fooled by URLs with query strings.
* Simplified handling of HAVE\_INT64T (Trisk). If this causes problems, e.g. if there are still systems which don't have "long long", we can back out the change.
* Keep a list of free connection structs, instead of doing linear search to find a free one (Adam Zell).
* Added config.h option FLUSH\_LOG\_EVERY\_TIME - if it's turned off, the log does not get fflushed after each request (Adam Zell).
* Multiple robustness improvements to the fdwatch module (Adam Zell).

* Prohibit slashes in the Host: header (Marcus Breiing).
* Added a -dd data\_dir flag and corresponding config-file option.
* Got rid of the old timer-based zombie process reaper, replacing it with a SIGCHLD handler.
* Changed the idle connection checking from using a separate timer for each connection to using a single timer that checks all active connections.

* Added include of config.h in mmc.c (A.D.F.).
* Fixed compile nit in syslog.c (Peter Harris).
* Added configure test for int64\_t.
* Fix CGI variable AUTH\_TYPE (Alexandre CHERIF).
* Slight correction to SIGUSR1 handling.
* Split clear\_connection() into two routines, one which sends a possible buffered response and the other which ignores such (David Burgess).

* Shortened LINGER\_TIME from two seconds to half a second.

* New throttling syslogs.
* Tuning tweaks to throttling, it's much more accurate now.
* Tweak to the sample log-rotation script.
* Allow trailing whitespace on the HTTP request line - it violates the HTTP/1.1 spec, but it's harmless, and at least one client (TiVo's v1.3 http\_get [not related to my own http\_get]) generates it.
* Changed the capitalization on some HTTP headers we generate, to interoperate with a client (yes, the same one) that is too stoopid to do case-insensitive matching.

* Added -g global passwd file option, suggested by Craig Leres.
* Robustness and performance improvements for mmap cache, from Evan Jones.
* kqueue support, from Niels Provos.
* If both select and poll are available, always use poll.
* Don't syslog "Connection reset by peer" errors.
* If the logfile is "/dev/null", don't bother logging at all.
* The mmap cache now tries to keep the total number of maps below a configurable parameter. See [DESIRED\_MAX\_MAPPED\_FILES](http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/options.html#DESIRED_MAX_MAPPED_FILES).

* Off-by-one error in base-64 decoding (Archie Cobbs).

New in version 2.20b:

* Corrected version of Marcel Telka's ssi fix. My bad.

New in version 2.20:

* Performance improvements to the timer package via hashing, and double-linking / sorting the lists. Partially based on a suggestion by Michal Ostrowski.
* Performance improvement to the mmap cache package, from Evan Jones.
* Minor Linux fix for open files limit, from Jordan Ritter.
* Fix for null ClientData, which picky compilers didn't like.

* IPv6 fix.
* Made MIME text character-set an option, with iso-8859-1 the default.

New in version 2.17:

New in version 2.14:

* Fix to non-local referer code - it was trying to dereference a null pointer under some circumstances.
* Fix to If-Modified-Since - some leap year problems.
* Rewrote match() - it was using a whole lot of CPU time for patterns with lots of |'s, such as those used by the new non-local-referer filtering.
* Fix to host lookup code for -h flag.
* Fix custom error pages to work with 401 Unauthorized.
