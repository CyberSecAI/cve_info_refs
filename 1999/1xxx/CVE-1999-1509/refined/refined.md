- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Eserv Web Server does not properly sanitize user-supplied URLs, allowing directory traversal using the "../" sequence.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can gain read access to arbitrary files outside of the intended web-published filesystem directory, including sensitive configuration files containing account names.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL containing "../" sequences, an attacker can access files they would not normally have access to via the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs network access to the Eserv web server and the ability to send HTTP requests.
