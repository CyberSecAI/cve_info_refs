- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ARCAD package for Linux unpacks with insecure default file permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The package sets all directories, binaries, and scripts to mode 777 (read, write, and execute for all users), and all non-executable files to mode 666 (read and write for all users).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could modify the binaries and scripts within the ARCAD package, leading to a trojan horse attack, where the malicious user can execute arbitrary code on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by a local attacker who modifies files within the ARCAD package.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to modify the files of the ARCAD package due to insecure permissions.
