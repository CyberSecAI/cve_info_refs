Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the Sendmail ETRN denial-of-service vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Sendmail handles the ETRN command. When Sendmail receives an ETRN command, it forks a child process. The parent process does not handle output, and thus doesn't get notified of send/write failures when the client drops the connection. The parent process continues to fork new child processes and sleep for 5 seconds, reading the buffered ETRN commands from the input buffer until it's empty.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of the ETRN command.
- Lack of parent process awareness of connection drops/failures.
- Accumulation of buffered ETRN commands without proper handling.
- Uncontrolled forking of child processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS).
- Exhaustion of server resources, particularly memory.
- Potential crashing of the server or other services (e.g., klogd).
- Creation of numerous unusable sendmail child processes that hang for an extended period.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote network connection.
- Sending multiple ETRN commands to the Sendmail server over a single TCP connection, and then dropping the connection.
- The attack is low-bandwidth, requiring only one connection at a time, which can make it difficult to detect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with the Sendmail server.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the target server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the server, specifically the ETRN command.

**Additional Details:**
- The `MaxDaemonChildren` option in `sendmail.cf` can limit the number of child processes, mitigating the impact of this DoS. However, this option is often disabled by default.
- This issue is being addressed in the upcoming 8.10.0 beta release of Sendmail.
- The vulnerability is triggered by a design flaw where the parent process is not notified of send/write failures.
- The attack can be performed with low bandwidth.
- The vulnerability can cause Linux 2.0 kernels to crash with "no memory" errors.
- The exploit involves sending a large number of ETRN commands before dropping the connection.
