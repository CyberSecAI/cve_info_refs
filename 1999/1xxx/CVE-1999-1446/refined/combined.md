%SystemRoot%\History too has MM2048.DAT and MM256.DAT. These two files
also contain every url you visited and every query you made in search
sites.

You can choose in IE 3 View/Options/Navigation/Clear History. After this
NT Explorer shows you have (almost) empty history. But when you open
these files with whichever binary editor (or just TYPE command), ALL THE
URLS ARE STILL THERE.

Gretings,

I tried to duplicate this situation on the NT 4.0 setup I have and did
face the same problem. Perhaps even more interesting, when I went to a
command prompt and performed a directory list of my local
"SystemRoot%\Temporary Internet File", it was empty. Opening the
directory and selecting a "details" view also give information which
seems to be quite different from a standard detail view of any other
directory. Right clicking an item in the Temporary Internet Files
directory also give a different pop-up, with an option to delete a local
copy, which does seem to indicate that the file is stored both locally
and at the internet address location shown in detail view.

technet has this to say about the directory:

9. Warn Users About the Dangers of Snooping
It isn't much fun to think about, but somebody snooping around on your
system could learn a great deal about what you've been up to. Suppose,
for example, you've gone off to lunch, and left your door open and your
computer running. Anyone who walks in could learn a lot about where
you've been online, just by looking in the folder where Internet
Explorer caches the pages you've downloaded.
Users can delete these files, but that's not a bulletproof solution.
Unbeknownst to most Internet Explorer users, the program keeps an exact
byte-by-byte record of where they've been online. This record is stored
in .DAT files located in the Temporary Internet Files folder. Amazingly
enough, these files also include an exact byte transcription of
everything you've uploaded and everything you've downloaded, right back
to the time you installed the program.
Here's the rub. Unlike files stored in Internet Explorer's cache, you
can't delete these .DAT files. (Try it-you'll be denied access.) By
copying these files and inspecting them with a binary decoder, a
knowledgeable intruder could reconstruct your users' every move going
back months, even years. If you're worried about snooping, the best
defense is to install a bulletproof, password-based authentication
program on your users' computers.

        Greetings,

          I was wondering if anyone could tell me why the "Temporary
Internet
        Files" directory (under \windows in 95 and %SystemRoot% in NT
4.0) behave
        differently. If you are using explorer and try to access this
file on a
        remote machine, the directory that is displayed is actually the
local
        directory, even though the path displayed in the title bar of
the window
        says "\\<remote machine>\Windows\Temporary Internet Files"

          If you try this from a Windows NT 3.51 machine, the directory
is empty.

          Regards,
            Richard
