Eastman Software's Work Management 3.21 for NT stores cleartext passwords
in the registry.

My company is enduring a forced migration from Eastman's Unix-based imaging
and workflow products to their NT products.  During the initial
installation and configuration of their software, I was called in to assist
with troubleshooting a connection to an optical disk drive.

While I was on the phone with Eastman's tech support, I was asked to check
some values in HKLM\Software\Kodak\Eastman Software Work Management\3.2\ODA
Drives.  While I was in the area, I browsed some of the other keys and
discovered to my horror that passwords were being stored in cleartext in
the COMMON and LOCATOR keys.

I immediately asked the tech support representative when this would be
fixed and he replied that he thought it would be fixed in their 4.0
release.  I warned him that I would submit my findings to the NTBugTraq
list, to which he had no response.

I am currently in the process of determining how much I can lock down those
registry keys to prevent unauthorized users from viewing these passwords.
 I will post my findings to the list if anyone is interested.
