Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from older (circa 1995) versions of SunOS `sendmail` using the `popen` function to process the `-oR` option. This option specifies the mail hub to forward mail to.
*   **Weakness:** The `popen` function, when used with untrusted input, allows for the execution of arbitrary shell commands due to insufficient sanitization of the arguments provided via the `-oR` option.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited by local users. They can manipulate the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) environment variable and supply malicious input to the `-oR` option, causing the `popen` function to execute arbitrary commands instead of the intended actions.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Local users on the vulnerable system can exploit this vulnerability. They need to be able to execute `sendmail` commands with the `-oR` option.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to local users gaining root access, giving them complete control over the system.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `-oR` option is used to specify the mail hub to forward mail to when a user on a client of that hub receives mail.
*   This host name can be specified on the command line as `-oR*host_name*`, in the configuration file as `OR*host_name*`, or by NFS mounting `/var/spool/mail` from a file server (where the file server's host name becomes the forwarding host).
*   All these configurations are vulnerable because of the usage of `popen`.
*   An exploit is known to exist for this vulnerability.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Older versions of SunOS (circa 1995) `sendmail`, specifically versions in SunOS 4.1.X, including patches 100377-19 (for SunOS 4.1.3), 101665-04 (for SunOS 4.1.3\_U1), and 102423-01 (for SunOS 4.1.4).

**Mitigation:**

*   The recommended solution is to upgrade to the most recent version of `sendmail`.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by Sun Microsystems around the time it was first discovered (circa 1995).
*   The vulnerability is also described in CERT Advisory CA-95-11.
