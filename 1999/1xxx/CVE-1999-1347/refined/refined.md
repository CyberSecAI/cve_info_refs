The provided content discusses two issues in RedHat 6.0 and 6.1. The second issue, which is related to `pam.d/rlogin`, is a vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists due to the order of modules in the `pam.d/rlogin` configuration file. The `pam_rhosts_auth.so` module, which allows authentication based on rhosts, is placed before `pam_nologin.so`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The weakness is in the PAM configuration for `rlogin`. Because the `pam_rhosts_auth.so` module is checked before `pam_nologin.so`, a user can bypass the `/etc/nologin` restriction if the rhosts authentication succeeds.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can bypass the `/etc/nologin` restriction and log into an account that is intended to be disabled. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is `rlogin`. An attacker needs to be on a host that is allowed through the rhosts authentication, either via `.rhosts` or `/etc/hosts.equiv`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have an account on a host that is trusted by the vulnerable system via rhosts authentication.

This vulnerability is related to CVE-1999-1347, as this CVE ID is associated with a missing nologin check in rlogin.
