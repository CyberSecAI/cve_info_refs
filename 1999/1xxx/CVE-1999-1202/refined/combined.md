While playing with a proxy server the other day, I have accidently
stumbled across two remote bugs in numerous proxy servers. Those
affected are "WinGate and StarTech". Both companies have been previously
notified of their vulnerability, and in WinGate's case I guess it has
been patched already.

The bug is pretty straight forward, telnet to the proxy server at its
pop3 port and type

For WinGate:
    USER x#99999.....

    With lots of nine's, the proxy server stops responding and needs to
be restarted.

For Startech:
     USER x<9999999.....>

      Once again, as many nines as possible, startech quits responding.

In Startech's case, this can also be done in the telnet daemon part of
it also...

Havent tried much others...

My Startech proxy server did not have a version number on it, and the
Wingate's wasn't available. Sorry, I will try to get this in tommarrow
if neccessary...
