- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The tin newsreader application, version 1.4.0, by default, stores all keystrokes typed into it, including passwords for authenticated news servers, in the file `~/.tin/.inputhistory`. The default permissions of this file allow other users to read it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insecure default file permissions that allow other users on the system to read the `.inputhistory` file. This file stores sensitive information like passwords for authenticated news servers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who has local access to the system can read the `~/.tin/.inputhistory` file and potentially obtain user passwords for authenticated news servers.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the user's account on the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have local access to the user's account on the system in order to read the `~/.tin/.inputhistory` file.
