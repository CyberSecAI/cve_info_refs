- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of local users to send forged packets using raw IP sockets, bypassing firewall rules, particularly when SLIP or PPP support is enabled in the kernel. This is due to insufficient checks on the source address when sending raw IP packets via those interfaces.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  -  Lack of proper source address validation when sending raw IP packets.
  -  Vulnerability exists on systems where SLIP or PPP support is compiled into the kernel or available as modules.
  -  Bypassing firewall rules due to the raw IP socket access.

-  **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Local users can send forged packets to any host.
    -  This can lead to attacks such as NFS attacks or exploitation of any protocol relying on IP addresses for authentication.
    -  Attackers can potentially bypass firewall restrictions, even those set up to protect from external threats.
    -  The impact is equivalent to a write-only access to raw IP sockets.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Local access to a shell account on the system is required.
    - The attacker uses raw IP sockets to send packets with spoofed source addresses.
  
-  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - Requires a local user account on a vulnerable Linux system.
   - No specific root privileges or suid flaws are needed.
