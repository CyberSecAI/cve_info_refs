- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rxvt` terminal emulator, when compiled with the `PRINT_PIPE` option and run suid root, does not drop root privileges before opening a pipe to a user-specified program using `popen()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The program is designed not to be run suid root but was by administrators, leading to privilege escalation.
    - The `PRINT_PIPE` option allows users to specify an arbitrary program to be executed via `popen()`.
    - The program retains root privileges while executing `popen()`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker uses the `-print-pipe` command-line option to specify a malicious program.
    - The attacker then sends the VT100 printer-on escape sequence (`ESC[5i`) to trigger execution of the specified program via `popen()`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs an account on the system.
    - The attacker needs access to an X server.
    - `rxvt` must be installed suid root with `PRINT_PIPE` enabled.
