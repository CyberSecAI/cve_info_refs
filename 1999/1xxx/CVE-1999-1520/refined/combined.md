====================================================
Site Server's AdSamples Directory Reveals ID and PSW
           Discovered by Andrey Kruchkov
====================================================

VERSIONS EFFECTED

* Tested on Microsoft Site Server 3.0 Commerce Edition

DESCRIPTION

Site Server allows the installation of an AdSamples directory, which serves
to demonstrate the capabilities of the Ad Server component. If this
directory is installed and left open to the public without limiting
directory permissions, a user can obtain a site configuration file
(SITE.CSC) that contains sensitive information pertaining to an SQL
database. This information could contain a DSN, as well as a a username and
password used by the Ad Server to access the SQL server database.

COMMENTS

Andrey reported this problem to NTSECURITY.NET and has informed Microsoft of
this issue.

Andrey points out an easy way to eliminate this risk:

Remove the "AdSamples" virtual directory from the DEFAULT root Web site, or
change security permissions for this folder to sufficiently restrict access.
If you must provide loose access to this virtual directory for some strange
reason, then you should at least adjust the security permissions for the
SITE.CSC file so that it's not available for viewing. Also keep in mind that
there may be numerous  other SITE.CSC files under your Site Server
installation, all of which need to be secured.

For a URL that demonstrates the problem, please visit
<http://www.ntsecurity.net/scripts/loader.asp?iD=/security/siteserver-2.htm>

This is probably a great time to remind people once again to NEVER install
sample content on production servers and to NEVER use the built-in IIS
DEFAULT Web site without first thoroughly investigating the implications of
doing so.

Thanks,
Mark - <http://www.ntsecurity.net>
