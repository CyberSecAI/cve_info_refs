- **Root cause of vulnerability:** MySQL server creates log files with world-readable permissions (644). These log files can contain sensitive information, such as user passwords, if they were included in SQL queries (e.g., INSERT statements) and logged.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure file permissions, logging of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can read the log files and gain access to sensitive information, including database user passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs access to the file system where the MySQL logs are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have read access to the server's filesystem where the MySQL log files are stored.
