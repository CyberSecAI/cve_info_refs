Hi Guys.

This may be old news to many of you, but it's new to me, so here we go.

Dr Solomon's will now be distributing alert & update notifications to
corporate customers using BackWeb to effectively "push" such
notifications to their customers.

I downloaded & installed the BackWeb client, noting that it required a
username & password for access through a Proxy server (as per our
set-up).

Seeing as our Proxy servers validate Internet access via our NT accounts
(& as my account carries administrator rights), I initially entered a
dummy account & then immediately checked in the registry. Sure enough,
there was my dummy username & password in CLEAR TEXT under
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Backweb\Backweb\Communication.

All you admins out there using similar proxy authentication should
beware!!

I've used a separate non admin account for this purpose, & have submitted
a request to the authors to change BackWeb to enable it to request a
username/password at start-up if required, but I'm not holding my breath.

Regards,
 Steven Vale.
