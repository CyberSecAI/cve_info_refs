The provided content is related to the following CVE: CVE-1999-1195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the VirusScan engine holding the main definition file `scan.dat` open during the FTP update process. This prevents the file from being overwritten with the new version.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The scan engine doesn't check return codes during the update process.
- The application log falsely reports successful updates even when the definition file update fails.
- Subsequent downloads of new definitions files also fail due to the old file being locked by the service.
- The software incorrectly indicates it has the latest definition file when it does not.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is that the system remains vulnerable to viruses because the virus definition file is not updated, despite the software reporting otherwise. The user or admin would believe they have the latest protection but in fact the software is not updated.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through normal automatic or manual updates of the virus definitions file via FTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
No specific attacker capabilities are required. The issue can occur via normal scheduled or manual updates to the software. The issue arises from a flaw in the update mechanism.
