The provided content describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in `counter.exe` version 2.70.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of specific crafted input to the `counter.exe` application. Specifically, two different inputs trigger the vulnerability.
1. Input containing a newline character: `<http://no-such-server-really/scripts/counter.exe?%0A>`
2. Input containing a large number of 'A' characters `<http://no-such-server-really/scripts/counter.exe?AAAAAover-2200-As>`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation leading to an Access Violation (null pointer dereference)
- Inability to handle large request strings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service. The application hangs and does not process further requests until someone interacts with the console and dismisses the Access Violation error.
- Memory consumption can occur if the malicious requests are sent continuously.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `counter.exe` application through a web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to a web server hosting the vulnerable `counter.exe` application.
