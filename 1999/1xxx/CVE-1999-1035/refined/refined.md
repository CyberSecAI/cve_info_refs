- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A vulnerability exists in the handling of HTTP GET requests by Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS). Specifically malformed GET requests can cause a denial-of-service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper handling of specially crafted HTTP GET requests leading to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. The server can become unresponsive, potentially requiring an IIS restart or even a server reboot.
- **Attack vectors:**  Attackers send specially crafted, malformed HTTP GET requests to the affected IIS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. The attack requires deliberate crafting of the malicious GET requests.
