# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS98-019 - Important

## Patch Available for IIS 'GET' Vulnerability

Published: December 21, 1998 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** December 21, 1998

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that fixes a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Information ServerÂ® that could allow denial-of-service attacks to be mounted against web servers.

There have been no reports of customers being affected by this vulnerability. However, Microsoft is publishing this bulletin and releasing the patch to allow customers to address the potential security risk it poses. As detailed below in What Customers Should Do, Microsoft recommends that users evaluate whether they are at risk from this attack and install the patch if appropriate.

**Issue**

This vulnerability involves the HTTP GET method, which is used to obtain information from an IIS web server. Specially-malformed GET requests can create a denial of service situation that consumes all server resources, causing a server to "hang." In some cases, the server can be put back into service by stopping and restarting IIS; in others, the server may need to be rebooted. This situation cannot happen accidentally. The malformed GET requests must be deliberately constructed and sent to the server. It is important to note that this vulnerability does not allow data on the server to be compromised, nor does it allow any privileges on it to be usurped.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Information Server, versions 3.0 and 4.0, on x86 and Alpha platforms.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-1035](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-1035)
