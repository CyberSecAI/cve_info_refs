The provided document contains information about two vulnerabilities, one of which is CVE-1999-1233.

**Vulnerability:** Domain Resolution Vulnerability

*   **Root Cause:**  IIS 4.0 restricts access to a website based on the user's domain. However, if IIS cannot resolve a user's IP address to a domain, it incorrectly grants the user's *first* request for a session. Subsequent requests are correctly denied.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper access control due to failure to handle unresolved domain names in the initial request.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Bypassing of domain-based access restrictions on the first request from an unresolvable IP.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A user whose IP address cannot be resolved to a domain can bypass access restrictions on their initial request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a network location where the server cannot resolve their IP to a domain name.

The document also mentions CVE-1999-0777 which is an FTP No Access Vulnerability but this is not relevant to CVE-1999-1233.
