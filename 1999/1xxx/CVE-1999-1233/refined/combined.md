# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-039 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Domain Resolution" and "FTP Download" Vulnerabilities

Published: September 23, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** September 23, 1999

**Revised:** September 30, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates two security vulnerabilities in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 and Microsoft Commercial Internet System (MCIS) 2.5. The vulnerabilities allow security restrictions in IIS and MCIS to be bypassed under certain conditions, as discussed below. Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-039.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-039).

**Issue**

There are two vulnerabilities at issue here:

* IIS 4.0 provides the ability to restrict access to a web site based on the user's domain. However, if IIS cannot resolve a user's IP address to a domain, it will grant the user's first request for a session. It will correctly deny them thereafter. This vulnerability affects IIS 4.0 only; it does not any other Microsoft product, including MCIS.
* A user who accesses an FTP site via a browser will be able to download files even if they are marked No Access. This vulnerability is due to a regression error that was introduced in hotfixes released after Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5; it does not exist in SP5 or in previous versions. This vulnerability affects both IIS 4.0 and MCIS 2.5, but no other Microsoft products.

Neither vulnerability provides a means to usurp control of the server. A patch is available that eliminates both vulnerabilities.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0
* Microsoft Commercial Internet System 2.5

**Vulnerability Identifiers**

* FTP No Access Vulnerability: [CVE-1999-0777](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0777)
