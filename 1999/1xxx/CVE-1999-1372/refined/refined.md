- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Triactive Remote Manager software stores the username and password in plaintext within the Windows registry if the user chooses not to use User-Level access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Plaintext storage of sensitive authentication credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker gaining access to the registry could obtain the username and password, allowing them to remotely control the machine and potentially cause damage to the system or use it for further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Gaining access to the Windows registry of the machine where Triactive Remote Manager is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to read the contents of the registry on the target machine. This could be achieved through local access, or via a remote compromise if other vulnerabilities exist.
