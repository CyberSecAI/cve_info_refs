# **SunOS 4.1.4 crashes when (l)users read /dev/tcx0**

| **Summary** |
| --- |

| **Description:** | Sparcstations running 4.1.4 (probably other versions too) crash when users read /dev/tcx0 with something like 'cat'. Not that this is a VERY generall problem. There are a lot of devices on many devices that will crash if you do wierd things to them. Especially cat'ing binary files to them. I am not going to write up a page on each. |

| **Author:** | Dixon Ly <dly@BAYNETWORKS.COM> mentioned this particular problem. |
| **Compromise:** | DOS attack, obviously annoy people. You could also do more devious thing, taking down the machine so you can IP spoof "from" it without it sending thos damn RST's! |
| **Vulnerable Systems:** | Sparc 5,10,20,etc. running SunOS 4.1.4 probably other versions. |

Subject: /dev/tcx0 crashes SunOS 4.1.4 on Sparc 20's

A while ago, I asked on Sun Managers group who I should tell about
a crash bug I found on Sparc 20's running SunOS 4.1.4.  The general
consensus was not to tell anyone except maybe send a message to CERT.
So I did.  Since then more people have suggested that I should send
it to Bugtraqs as well....so while I still have messages sprouting
from my previous email address reminding me this, let me post it before
I cut everything off:

If you try to read /dev/tcx0 on a SunOS 4.1.4 Sparc 20 (it didn't
work on a 10; didn't have access to a Sparc 5, so I couldn't check
that), you will cause a system panic.  How do you read it, you ask?
Simply "cat /dev/tcx0" or "ls /dev/tcx0/*".  You don't need special
privileges to use it.

Now, I have never own'ed a tcx frame buffer.  These only exist on Sparc 5
right?  So I don't know what will happen if you do have a tcx device.
If you don't, then the simplest fix is to just remove the darn entry under
/dev.
