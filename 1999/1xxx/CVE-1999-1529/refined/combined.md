As microsofts mail hubs seem to be going a little haywire at present,
we'll let them off the hook with a quick patch to prevent the helo
overflow.

A patch for version 3.3 will be released shortly.

The patch is available at <http://www.beavuh.org>

A buffer overflow exists on the VirusWall smtp gateway - by sending a long
HELO command you can overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code.

Example code has been written which will spawn a command prompt on a port
you specify.

Before you shrug this one off, take a look:

The ironic thing here is, VirusWall was designed to prevent viruses and
'malicious code'.

Obviously not a lot of thought was taken before laying their trust into
3rd party 'security' products.

A quick note to the millions out there who would give their right arm to
compromise microsofts network - sorry, their firewall would prevent the
payload from spawning a remote shell.. unless of course it was modified to
stop an existing service to open a port :)

Exploit source and binary is available at <http://www.beavuh.org>.

Just to keep everyone updated, Trend has examined the exploit and is
currently in the process of testing an official patch for this problem.
This should be available within a few hours at most.
