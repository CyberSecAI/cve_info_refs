## Weak CRC allows packet injection into SSH sessions encrypted with block ciphers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#13877

Original Release Date: 2001-11-07 | Last Revised: 2003-05-20

---

### Overview

There is an information integrity vulnerability in the SSH1 protocol that allows packets encrypted with a block cipher to be modified without notice.

### Description

| **Preconditions:**  Attacker has a fragment of plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext.Attacker must be able to actively intercept a connection attempt or hijack an existing SSH session.Session is encrypted using a block cipher.Compression is disabled.SSH1 sessions that encrypt traffic with block ciphers in cipher feedback (CFB) mode are vulnerable to an attack similar to one described in [VU#315308](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/315308). However, if the attacker has additional information consisting of both a fragment of plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, it is then possible to overcome the protection introduced by cipher feedback, thus allowing the attacker to modify **any** packet in the stream. As in [VU#315308](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/315308), this vulnerability is caused by inherent weaknesses in CRC checksums. For more details on these weaknesses, please see [VU#25309](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/25309). Also, it is important to note that this vulnerability also affects SSH1 sessions that use block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can modify arbitrary packets within an encrypted SSH session. |

### Solution

| **Apply a patch from your vendor**In June 1998, CORE-SDI released code to detect and block attacks exploiting this vulnerability. This code was subsequently incorporated into several SSH implementations, but it contained a flaw that introduced a remote integer overflow. For vendor-specific information regarding this vulnerability, please see the Systems Affected section of this document. For more information regarding the vulnerability introduced by previous attempts to patch this vulnerability, please see [VU#945216](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/945216). |

### [SSH Communications Security](#JPLA-53TUHA) Affected

Updated:  November 06, 2001

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

The vendor has not provided us with any further information regarding this vulnerability.

### Addendum

This vulnerability first addressed by incorporating code written by CORE-SDI to detect and block CRC32 attacks. However, an implementation error in this code caused the vulnerability described in [VU#945216](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/945216), which was ultimately addressed in Secure Shell 1.2.32, available at

ftp://ftp.ssh.com/pub/ssh/

SSH Communications has released a public statment regarding ; for more information, please visit

<http://www.ssh.com/products/ssh/advisories/ssh1_crc-32.cfm>

It is important to note that versions 2.x and 3.x of SSH Secure Shell do not serve as replacements for the SSH1 protocol. Rather, they rely upon an existing installation of Secure Shell 1.x to handle SSH1 connections. Thus, installing a version 2.x or 3.x server does not obviate the need to maintain installations of Secure Shell 1.x.

If you have feedback, comments, or additional information about this vulnerability, please send us email.
