A few clarifications on my last post.

- I mixed up iris and retina scans.  The iris is the thing in front of your
eye with the pretty colors.  The retina is the thing in the back with the
photoreceptors.  Both are useful for identification, but the iris is
somewhat less difficult to scan.  Bank United of Texas intends to do iris
scans.

- Two companies who are apparently big into eye-dentification are Sensar [1]
and IriScan [2].  The latter site has more depth in its description of the
technology.  One private e-mail I received described that modern ATM
machines from Diebold and NCR run Windows NT (*sigh*) and allow third
parties to integrate their own security measures.

- As biometrics go, iris scans seem to be pretty good.  I'm willing to
believe vendor claims of high discrimination and low error rates.  In
particular, [3] claims that the system can be designed to have an error rate
of approximately 1 in a million (both false accepts and rejects).  There is
a tradeoff where the designer can choose to decrease the odds of a false
accept in exchange for increasing the odds of a false reject.  One such
stated data point would have one in 22700 customers falsely rejected in
return for a one in 10^11 false accept rate.  "Authentication failed.
Please try again."

- Claims that iris biometrics cannot be copied or spoofed seem less
believable.  Once I've got a good photograph of your iris, I should be able
to (with some expense) construct an artificial eye that matches the
original.  Vendors claim recognition times of 2-4 seconds.  That's how long
you hold your styrofoam head in front of the machine.  [3] mentions various
other spectral scans (i.e., infrared light) that might distinguish a
styrofoam dummy from an actual head and a glass eye from a real eye.  I'm
sure this stuff works great, but again will be broken in due course.

- I've received some interesting private e-mail on this subject.  There are
some people who don't have irises (300 children born this way per year in
the U.S., says one person preferring to remain anonymous).  One issue with
pure biometric authentication is dealing with the non-zero number of people
who don't happen to *have* your preferred biometric.

- Both companies seem to be marketing their products as the only form of
authentication you need.  This is my strongest complaint.  I could support
the use of a smartcard as the primary identification and the biometric as a
replacement for PINs or passwords.  That would be sensible for banking
applications and would help quash any desires for evil-doers to try beating
the system.  Also, for the biometrically-challenged, their cards could be
coded in such a way as to indicate the customer is a special case for the
system.  Indeed, I find it hard to imagine my bank not wanting to keep a
piece of plastic in my wallet with their name on it.

- Lastly, we haven't even begun to discuss the risks that occur when an
industrious bank officer physically hacks the ATM.  If the ATM hacker need
only intercept the video camera wires, a quite nasty attack could be
developed which nicely generates perfect "evidence" that a transaction
occurred.  Conversely, a crypto smartcard could go great distances in
eliminating the ease of such an insider attack.  (Not that smartcards don't
have their own problems, for example, differential power analysis [4].)
