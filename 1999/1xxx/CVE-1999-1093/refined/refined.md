Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, 4.01, and 4.01 SP1 handle JScript scripts, specifically the `Window.External` function when called with a very long string. This can lead to a termination of the browser.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow or similar memory corruption issue triggered by providing an excessively large string to the `Window.External` function within the JScript engine (version 3.1).
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could cause Internet Explorer to terminate. More critically, a skilled attacker could leverage this to execute arbitrary code contained within the malicious long string.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious web page that intentionally includes a JScript script designed to call `Window.External` with a very long string. The user must visit this malicious website to be affected.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to create a malicious website that contains the specific malicious JScript code. The attacker has to entice the victim to visit the malicious website.

The document also mentions that there were no reports of this vulnerability being exploited before the patch was released.
