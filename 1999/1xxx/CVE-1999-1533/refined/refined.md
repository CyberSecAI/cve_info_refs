Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the password handling mechanism of the Eicon Diehl LAN ISDN modem's web interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The web interface does not properly validate the length of the password parameter in the `login.htm` request. Supplying an overly long password causes a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability causes the modem to lock up and become unresponsive, requiring a hard reset to restore functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/login.htm` page with an overly long password provided via the `password` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the modem's web interface. This typically means being on the same local network as the modem or having access through a network connection.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP requests**: The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to send an HTTP request through a browser or other means.

**Additional Details:**
- The content suggests that the overflow likely overwrites the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) register, leading to the crash.
- The reported exploit uses a password length of 40 characters (`0123456789012345678901234567890123456789`).
- The vendor, Eicon Diehl, was informed about the bug.
