```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The GWWEB.EXE program does not properly sanitize user input provided through the HELP argument, allowing for directory traversal and arbitrary file access.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path disclosure: The server reveals its full web path when provided with an invalid filename in the HELP argument.",
    "Directory traversal: By using relative paths like '../../../../', an attacker can access files outside of the intended web directory.",
    "Arbitrary file access: The attacker can read any .htm file on the system by exploiting the directory traversal vulnerability."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read sensitive HTML files stored on the server, potentially exposing confidential information or the structure of the web application. The full web path disclosure can be used for further exploitation.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the GWWEB.EXE program with a malicious HELP argument.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server."
