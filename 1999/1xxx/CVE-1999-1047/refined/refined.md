Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a specific order of installing patches on a Gauntlet 5.0 BSDI firewall. Installing the BSDI patch M310-049 *after* installing Gauntlet 5.0 and its kernel patch level 2 leads to a bypass of the firewall's security rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a flaw in how the Gauntlet firewall interacts with the BSDI kernel after the application of specific patches in a specific order. It seems that the kernel patch installation modifies network processing such that Gauntlet's rules are no longer correctly enforced. This results in a complete bypass of the firewall rules, irrespective of the proxies used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is severe. It allows:
*   Local trusted and remote non-trusted users to bypass all Gauntlet security rules.
*   Exposure of the internal network scheme.
*   Unauthorized access to internal systems and resources.
*   Network traffic will not be NATed by the firewall, meaning a route to the internal network through the firewall must exist.
*  No logging of the traffic bypass in the firewall logs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network routing:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by setting up routes through the firewall, essentially making the firewall transparent. This can be done by setting a gateway on the client to point to the firewall's internal interface, and a gateway on a server to point to the firewall's external interface, removing the requirement for a proxy on the client machine.
*   **Direct TCP connections:** Any TCP connection can bypass the firewall in the described configuration, not just proxy connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the firewall, either from the internal or external network, with the ability to route traffic through the firewall.
*   **Configuration Knowledge:** The attacker doesn't need to know the specific configurations of Gauntlet, since the vulnerability completely bypasses it.

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue is specific to Gauntlet 5.0 on BSDI, when BSDI patches M310-049 and Gauntlet kernel patch level 2 are installed in the specified order.
*   The vulnerability is not present in unpatched systems or if the patches are applied in a different order (specifically, M310-049 must be installed *before* Gauntlet 5.0)
*   The provided steps for reproducing the issue are detailed, allowing easy verification.
*   The vendor was contacted and a patch was expected, but no specific patch is mentioned.
*   A workaround is provided, which involves manually copying the `ip_input.o` file and rebuilding the kernel, but this is done without any warranty, and is not recommended by the author.
