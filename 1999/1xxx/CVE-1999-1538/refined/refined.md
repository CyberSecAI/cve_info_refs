The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in Microsoft IIS:

**1. Vulnerability in `ism.dll` (IIS 2 and 3 relic)**

*   **Root Cause:** The presence of `ism.dll`, a leftover ISAPI application from IIS 2 and 3, in the `/scripts/iisadmin` directory in IIS 4.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** `ism.dll` allows remote access to web-based administration functionality, which is intended to be restricted to the loopback address (127.0.0.1) in IIS 4. This bypasses the intended security measure of IIS 4.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can access sensitive server information by authenticating to `ism.dll` by guessing the Administrator password through a brute-force attack and gain significant reconnaissance information. While changes can't be made, it provides a stepping stone for further attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Accessing `ism.dll` through a URL like `<http://www.server.com/scripts/iisadmin/ism.dll?http/dir>` from a non-loopback IP address.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and be able to attempt brute-force authentication.

**2. Buffer Overflow in `fpcount.exe` (FrontPage Server Extensions)**

*   **Root Cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `fpcount.exe` utility located in the `/_vti_bin/` directory when FrontPage Server Extensions are installed alongside IIS 4.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** An exploitable buffer overflow in the `fpcount.exe` executable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The content only mentions this vulnerability exists, and is exploitable, but doesn't describe the impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The content does not describe how this buffer overflow can be triggered.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Not described in detail within the content.
