- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Matrix" screensaver for Windows 95/NT fails to properly enforce password protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The screensaver allows termination without requiring a password when the "Escape" key is pressed, even when password protection is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to a user's PC when the screensaver is active.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the computer when the screensaver is active. The user wakes the screensaver up by moving the mouse or pressing a key, and then simply presses the "Escape" key to terminate the screensaver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the computer and be present at the time the screensaver is active.
