Summary: "The Matrix" Windows 9.x/NT screensaver password protection
doesn't work.

This is *not* a major problem, especially for those folks who stick
to guidelines and never install any screensavers that weren't supplied
by Microsoft with Windows ;-).   In fact it hardly seems worth bothering
Bugtraq with it, except that so many admins seem to be quite taken
with "Matrix theory" ...

[ I tried informing the owners of this "product" by emailing
webmaster@whatisthematrix.com, but my email was bounced (connection
refused), so they've had their chance - other folks need to know. ]

Copy of what I emailed to the authors of the "Matrix" screensaver available
at <http://www.whatisthematrix.com> :

Dear Whoever-runs-your-website,

I just downloaded your Matrix screensaver for Windows 95/NT (for which :
thanks) and having now tried it I feel I must bring to your attention a
*serious* security bug in the screensaver :-

Running on Windows 95 OSR2, if I set the "Password protected" screensaver
option, then when the screen saver is running, if I move the mouse or press
a key to wake the screensaver up, a password prompt appears as it should,
but I can then simply press the "Escape" keyboard key and the screensaver
terminates with no password required - aaaaggghh !

Given the popularity of the Matrix film among computer industry people, I
imagine many people are running the screensaver, and therefore are
subjecting themselves to a significant risk of unauthorised access to
their PCs. I decided I should inform you of the bug, to give you a chance
to fix it, before I start publicising the risk in the regular security
forums on
the Internet.
