{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ActiveX control Cenroll allows creation of arbitrary files on the local system.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The Cenroll ActiveX control, specifically the Enroll.createFilePKCS10 method, allows callers to create files with arbitrary names and contents (base-64 encoded PKCS#10 request) with the permissions of the process running the control. The control is marked as 'safe-for-scripting'.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can create files with arbitrary names and influence their content using a base-64 encoded PCKS#10 request. While the provided information does not specify a definite attack vector for exploiting the influenced content, the vulnerability can be used for creating an arbitrary number of files.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a caller utilizing the 'Enroll.createFilePKCS10' method of the 'Cenroll' ActiveX control, typically through a web browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code with the permissions of the user that runs the ActiveX control. This would normally be through a web browser by loading a webpage that executes the control."
