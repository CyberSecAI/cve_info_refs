The provided content is a security advisory detailing two vulnerabilities in Kerberos V, specifically:

**Problem 1:**

*   **Root cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Kerberos IV compatibility library under Kerberos V. This occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when reading configuration files, which can be specified via an environment variable (`KRB_CONF`).
*   **Weaknesses:**  Improper bounds checking of the `KRB_CONF` environment variable when processing config files.
*   **Impact:** Exploiting this allows a malicious local user to gain root privileges if any setuid programs use the vulnerable Kerberos IV functions. This is due to overflowing a buffer with a crafted configuration file, and allowing the attacker to seize control of the application calling the vulnerable function and thus gaining root access.
*   **Attack vector:** Local attack, requiring the ability to set the `KRB_CONF` environment variable and execute a setuid program using Kerberos IV functions.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to set environment variables and execute vulnerable setuid programs locally.

**Problem 2:**

*   **Root cause:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the Kerberized telnet daemon due to improper bounds checking of the `TERM` environment variable.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Insufficient bounds checking when using the `getenv("TERM")` function to create a string.
*   **Impact:** Remote attackers can achieve root access on systems running the vulnerable Kerberos V telnet daemon.
*   **Attack vector:** Remote exploitation of the telnet daemon.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to a vulnerable Kerberos V telnet daemon.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory specifies affected systems, including Kerberos V 1.0, KTH 0.9.3, OpenBSD 2.0, and Cygnus R3 derived Kerberos implementations. The vanilla MIT Kerberos IV code was not vulnerable to the first problem.
*   The advisory provides fix information, directing users to update to Kerberos V 1.0 patch level 1 or update to OpenBSD-current.
