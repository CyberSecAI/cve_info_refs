- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The DIT TransferPro package installs device driver files (`/devices/sbus@1,f8000000/esp@0,800000/ff@0,0:a,0,blk` and `/devices/sbus@1,f8000000/esp@0,800000/ff@0,0:a,0,raw`) with insecure permissions (0666). These devices are used for accessing removable media but can also interact with regular disks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file permissions on device driver files. The permissions are set to `rw-rw-rw-`, allowing any user to read and write to the device.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A normal user can access and potentially corrupt any disk by specifying the device file. In this case, the user specified the device for the primary hard drive which resulted in disk corruption, requiring a reinstall of the operating system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access through the file system. A user can interact with the device driver files directly via command-line tools like `tar` or other utilities that read and write to device files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Any local user. No special privileges are needed due to the insecure permissions on the device files.
