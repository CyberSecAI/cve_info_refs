The provided content relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-1999-1582.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the interaction between the `established` command and static conduits in Cisco PIX firewalls. When a firewall allows "established" TCP connections and has a static NAT mapping to internal servers with conduits for specific ports, an external attacker can bypass the firewall restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `established` command allows subsequent connections to any TCP port on an internal machine if an initial connection attempt, even if it fails, is made to a port with a configured conduit.
- The firewall does not check the direction of the initial connection, meaning that an external connection to an internal server, even if only an attempt, allows subsequent connections from the attacker to any port of the internal server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the firewall and gain access to any TCP port on an internal server.
- This bypass defeats the purpose of the firewall and exposes the internal network.
- If a vulnerable FTP server with PORT command support is present on the internal network, an attacker can connect to any internal machine that is running any public facing service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An external attacker initiates a connection to a TCP port on an internal server that has a conduit defined on the firewall.
- This initial connection attempt, even if unsuccessful, opens a window of opportunity for the attacker.
- The attacker can then establish connections to any TCP port on the internal server during that window.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to initiate an external connection to a port on an internal machine for which there is a static conduit defined in the firewall configuration.
- The attacker must be able to leverage this initial connection to establish a subsequent connection to any desired TCP port on the internal server.
