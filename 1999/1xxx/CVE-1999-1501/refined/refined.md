- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SGI O2 system running Irix 6.3 included two setuid (suid) root binaries, `ipxchk` and `ipxlink`, related to the Novell IPX protocol. These binaries did not properly reset the environment, called other programs via `system`, and had issues with temporary files.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The suid binaries `ipxchk` and `ipxlink` did not reset the environment, allowing attackers to manipulate the environment variables.
    - The binaries called other programs via the `system()` function, which can be vulnerable to shell injection or path manipulation.
    - The use of temporary files created additional vulnerabilities.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain root privileges on the system.

- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the environment variables, specifically IFS, and taking advantage of how the programs call other binaries and use temporary files, an attacker could execute arbitrary code as root.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the system where the vulnerable suid binaries are present. No special position or capability is noted beyond the ability to execute programs.
