- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Microsoft SQL Server stores the password for the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account in an unprotected section of the registry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The password for the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account is stored in the registry under the key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSqlServer\SQLExecutive` as a REG_BINARY value named `CmdExecAccount`. The password data is encrypted using the PKZip algorithm with a fixed key, making it easily decryptable.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker who obtains the decrypted password can potentially gain control over the SQLExecutiveCmdExec account. Although this account has limited rights, this could still allow for some level of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:**  An attacker would need to access the registry of the server where SQL Server is installed, either remotely or locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to access the registry on the target server. This could be achieved through various means, such as compromising an existing user account on the system, or leveraging a separate vulnerability.
