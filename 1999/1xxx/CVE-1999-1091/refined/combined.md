Hi everyone,

I am not sure if this is a known vulnerability, but the newsreader
tin also has a problem with mode 666 temp files. The standard distribution
creates /tmp/.tin_log by default, and can be abused to create any
file writable by the tin user. Existing files can be overwritten
and made world writable as long as this is so.

The tin user's account can similarly be compromised with the creation
of an .rhosts file as with other recent exploits of the same nature.

This bug is less convenient to exploit than the others since the log file
is created only by the first person to run tin before .tin_log exists.
Subsequent tin users are appended to this log file. It would therefore
take some guess work to determine who this first tin user would be. This
is perhaps easier to accomplish on a dedicated user workstation.
The opportunity to exploit tin would be after each reboot when /tmp is
cleared up.

This problem affects tin 1.2 PL1 and the current PL2 as well.

Here's the offensive source code:

                joinpath (log_file, TMPDIR, LOG_USER_FILE);

                if ((fp = fopen (log_file, "a+")) != (FILE *) 0) {
                        time (&epoch);
                        fprintf (fp, "%s%s: %-32s (%-8s) %s",
                                VERSION, PATCHLEVEL,
#ifdef M_AMIGA
                                get_val ("REALNAME", "Unknown"),
                                get_val ("USERNAME", "Unknown"),
#else
                                buf,
                                myentry->pw_name,
#endif
                                ctime (&epoch));
                        fclose (fp);
                        chmod (log_file, 0666);
                }

Rgds,
Song

Small bug I discovered in the unix NEWS reader tin/rin.

Then a user run rtin/tin a user-list will be created in /tmp/.tin_log
with mode 0666. and if a user makes a symlink from /etc/passwd (or any
file) to /tmp/.tin_log and root or another user with uid 0 runs rtin/tin,
tin will follow the symlink to /etc/passwd and change the mode to 0666.

I hope no admin's are stupid enough to run rtin/tin as uid 0. :-)

        I consider it well known, but that could just be me.
        In any event, add

        -DDONT_LOG_USER

to your Makefile, and it won't compile in this code.  Security hole
aside, it is also potential an invasion of user privacy.
