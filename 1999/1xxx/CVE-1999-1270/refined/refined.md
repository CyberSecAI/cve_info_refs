- **Root cause of vulnerability:** KMail passes the PGP secret key's passphrase as a command-line argument to the `pgp` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Passphrases being exposed in command-line arguments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Any user logged on the same machine as a KMail user using PGP can obtain the passphrase. This allows the attacker to potentially decrypt the user's emails or forge signatures.
- **Attack vectors:**  Local access to the same machine where KMail is being used.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged into the same system as the KMail user and be able to run commands. They can use a simple script to monitor process listings to capture the passphrase.
