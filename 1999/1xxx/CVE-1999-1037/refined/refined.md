Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The core issue is the use of predictable temporary file names in `/tmp` (or `/usr/tmp` in some cases) by several security tools: `satan`, `cops`, and `tiger`. These tools often run with root privileges, making the vulnerability more critical.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Race Conditions:** The tools create temporary files in shared directories (like `/tmp`) with predictable names based on process IDs ($$) or other simple patterns. This allows an attacker to potentially create a symbolic link with the same name before the tools do, or use the temporary file before it's removed. This time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition is the main vulnerability.
    *   **Insecure File Creation/Overwrite:**  The vulnerable tools use insecure methods to create or write to temporary files. The `touch` command and file redirection with `>` can be abused to overwrite or create arbitrary files if the attacker wins the race condition.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite:** An attacker can use the race condition to create or overwrite any file on the system, potentially gaining root access by overwriting critical system files.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overwriting key system files, an attacker can cause a denial of service.  The email mentions .nologin as a possible file to target for DoS.
    *   **Potential Root Compromise:** Depending on system configuration and timing, successful exploitation could lead to complete root compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a symbolic link with the same name as the temporary file created by the vulnerable program. This is done before the vulnerable program creates the actual file, leveraging the race condition.
    *   For the `cops` vulnerability in `checkacct/ca.src`, the `touch` command following a symbolic link allows arbitrary file creation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to run a process on the target system.
    *   The attacker needs to have sufficient privileges to create symbolic links in the directories where the tools create temporary files, which is often world-writable.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to execute their attack script simultaneously with the vulnerable program to win the race condition.

**Specific Vulnerable Tools:**

*   **Satan v1.1.1:**
    *   Vulnerable file: `bin/rex.satan`
    *   Issue: Uses `/tmp/rex.$$` for a temporary file, creating a race condition.
    *   Fix: Change to `./rex.$$`.
*   **Cops v1.04:**
    *   Vulnerable files:
        *   `res_diff`: Uses `/tmp/tmp.$$.foo` and `/tmp/tmp.$$.bar` for temporary files, creating a race condition.
        *   `checkacct/ca.src`: Uses `touch` with a path containing `/tmp`, allowing for arbitrary file creation through symlink following.
        *   `extra_src/mail.chk`: Uses `/usr/tmp/mchk.p$$` and `/usr/tmp/mchk.t$$` for temporary files, creating a race condition.
    *   Fix: Implement directory creation with umask 077, then create temp files in those directories.
*  **Tiger v2.2.3:**
    *   Issue: Uses `/tmp` as the working directory ($WORKDIR), resulting in many temporary file race conditions.
    *  Fix: Set the $WORKDIR to `$TIGER_HOME/tmp` and create the directory if it doesn't exist.

**Patches:**
The provided text includes patches for `cops` and `tiger`, these patches create a temporary directory and use it for temporary files, avoiding the use of /tmp and race conditions.

**Additional Notes:**
* The email emphasizes that many security tools had been around for years without these flaws being caught.
* The message mentions that COPS should not be run as root, but if it is, the vulnerabilities can be exploited.

This is a classic example of a TOCTOU (time-of-check to time-of-use) vulnerability and highlights the need to carefully manage temporary files.
