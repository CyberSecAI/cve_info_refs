- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in `inetd` on AIX 4.1.5 causes it to listen on a port one less than the port assigned to `ttdbserver`. This port isn't associated with a service, but allows connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** `inetd` incorrectly listens on an unintended port. The lack of proper handling for connections to this port leads to resource exhaustion.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Memory exhaustion on the target machine.
    - Increased CPU usage by the "gil" kernel thread.
    - Unresponsive target machine, requiring reboot.
    - Exhaustion of mbufs.
    - Accumulation of CLOSE_WAIT connections.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network-based attack via `telnet` or similar tools.
    - Sending characters to the open, but unhandled port.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - No authentication or special privileges required.
    - Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable AIX machine.
