Hello.

I've recently completed a preliminary analysis of a rather bothersome flaw
with the Windows 9x TCP/IP stack.  Seeing as how this is a bug in 95/98,
you may be wondering why I am posting this to the NTBugTraq list.
Since many, if not most NT network installs are on the same subnet
as 95/98 clients, and since this bug can drastically increase network
traffic to unusable levels, I feel that this is relevant to NT users.

From the abstract:

====

ABSTRACT FOR TCP CHORUSING

Microsoft Windows 95 and 98 clients have the capability to bind multiple
TCP/IP stacks to the same MAC address, simply by having the protocol added
more than once in the Network control panel.  This is actually quite useful,
except for the fact that these stacks can run concurrently on the same IP,
even if they receive their IP through BOOTP/DHCP.  The effect of the bug is
to cause the number of ACKnowledgement packets sent to be equal to that of
the number of loaded and bound TCP/IP stacks, creating excessive and
significant network noise and collisions.  At least one Samba 2.0.0beta1
server on an affected subnet becomes completely inaccessible when one of
these machines is activated.

Redundant ACKing can be referred to as TCP Chorusing, due to the minor time
delays introduced between multiple copies of identical data.  The problem is
undetectable using the Ping command built into Windows 95 or 98--this is a
significant bug in and of itself.  Linux´s ping is not similarly crippled.
NT was not available for testing.

By preliminary, I explictly mean that while I've done my best to clear out
any errors, factual or typographical, some may remain.  So, if there's
anything amiss, please email me at effugas@best.com and I will attempt to
address your concerns.

Yours Truly,
