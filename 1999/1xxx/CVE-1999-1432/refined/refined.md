- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When a Solaris system resumes from a suspended state (using power management), there is a period after the "Restoring system..." message disappears but before the lock screen activates where keyboard input is processed by the last active application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A race condition exists between system restoration and the activation of the lockscreen, allowing for input to reach applications before they are secured.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands as the user who suspended the system, potentially including privileged users.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs physical access to the machine, the ability to power it on from a suspended state, and the knowledge of the timing window to enter commands during the vulnerable period.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to a suspended system and the knowledge of the timing of the vulnerability to execute commands. They don't need root privileges prior to the attack, as they can obtain it by entering commands during the vulnerable period.
