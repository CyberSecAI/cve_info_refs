Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: Stack-based buffer overflow in `save_embedded_address()`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `save_embedded_address()` function copies data from an email header (specifically `From:` or `Reply-To:`) into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. The loop continues to copy data even if it exceeds the buffer size (512 bytes), resulting in a buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to uncontrolled data copy into a fixed-size buffer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote:**  A remote attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code as the user running `filter`, and possibly gain additional privileges that would allow them to write to the mail spool directory.  This is contingent on the way the victim's MTA handles oversized headers.
    *   **Local:** A local user can read other users' mail spools and gain write access to the mail spool directory, which can be used to disrupt the mail subsystem.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote:** Sending a crafted email with an excessively long `From:` or `Reply-To:` header.
    *   **Local:** Sending a crafted email processed by the vulnerable filter locally.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote:** Ability to send emails to a system using the vulnerable `filter` program.
    *   **Local:** Ability to send or manipulate email that gets processed by the local vulnerable `filter` program.

**Vulnerability 2: Stack-based buffer overflow in `get_filter_rules()`**

*   **Root Cause:** The `get_filter_rules()` function uses `strcpy()` to copy the filename given via the `-f` command-line argument into a stack buffer, without any bounds checking.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stack-based buffer overflow due to the usage of `strcpy()` without bounds checking.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Local:** A local user can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running `filter`, which may be root, by providing a long filename as a command-line argument, leading to local privilege escalation. A local user can also read other users' mail spools and gain write access to the mail spool directory.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  A local user providing a long filename using the `-f` command-line argument when running `filter`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local:** Ability to execute the `filter` program on the target system with control over command-line arguments.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that `filter` is not supported in `elm 2.5` and it is recommended to not use the program.
*   The advisory includes the code changes to address the buffer overflows, which include changing `strcpy()` to `strncpy()` with a size limit and changing the size of the buffer in `save_embedded_address()`.
