# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-008 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Registry Permissions" Vulnerability

Published: March 09, 2000 | Updated: April 14, 2000

**Version:** 1.1

**Originally Posted:** March 09, 2000

**Revised:** April 14, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a tool that installs tighter permissions on three sets of registry values in Windows NT 4.0. The default permissions could allow a malicious user to gain additional privileges on an affected machine.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-008.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-008).

### General Information

## Issue

This vulnerability involves three sets of registry keys whose default permissions are too permissive. These permissions could allow a malicious user who could interactively log onto a target machine (or,in one case, access an affected machine from the network) to:

* Cause code to run in a local system context.
* Cause code to run the next time another user logged onto the same machine.
* Disable the security protection for a previously-reported vulnerability.

These three key sets are not related to each other except by the fact that their permissions should be tightened. A tool is available that will reset all of the affected keys to the correct default value.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition

  NOTE: Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability.
