The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the bash shell.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how `bash` handles the expansion of the prompt line, specifically the `\w` escape sequence within the `PS1` variable.
- When `\w` is used, bash reads the current working directory from the `PWD` environment variable. This value is then copied into a fixed-size buffer.
- If the `PWD` environment variable contains a path longer than the buffer can hold, a buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: The fixed-size buffer used for storing the prompt string is overflowed by an overly long working directory string from the `PWD` variable.
- Unsafe use of environment variables: `bash` trusts the content of the `PWD` environment variable without sufficient bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, including shellcode injected into the environment.
- In the described exploit, the attacker replaces the return address with the address of shellcode injected into the `EGG` environment variable. This shellcode is designed to execute `/bin/ls` but could be replaced with more malicious payloads.

**Attack vectors:**
- Environment variable manipulation: The attacker sets the `PWD` environment variable to a string longer than the buffer used by `bash` when expanding `\w` in the prompt, causing a buffer overflow when the prompt is generated.
- The `PS1` variable must contain `\w` to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to modify environment variables, particularly `PWD` and `PS1`, before running a bash session.
- The vulnerability is triggered when bash needs to expand the prompt (PS1) containing the `\w` sequence. This happens each time bash displays a prompt.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to deduce the approximate location of the stack, so they can place the shellcode at a known address. The provided exploit code `eggo.c` aids in this, calculating the stack address with `get_sp()`
