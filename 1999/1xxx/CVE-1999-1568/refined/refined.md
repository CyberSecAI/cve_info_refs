- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack buffer overflow exists in the `PORT` command parsing function of NcFTPd. This function incorrectly handles the input provided, specifically by modifying certain characters to a space.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow vulnerability due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing the `PORT` command.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Remote code execution is theoretically possible, although difficult due to the program's character conversion in the vulnerable function.
    -  Denial-of-service by crashing the child process handling the connection. This results in a temporary zombie process and a new one being spawned.
    -  Possible log evasion.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted `PORT` command with an overly long string to the vulnerable FTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the FTP service. An attacker can be an unauthenticated user (anonymous login is used in the PoC).
