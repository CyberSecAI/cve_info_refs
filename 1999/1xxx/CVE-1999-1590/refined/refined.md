Root cause of vulnerability:
The wwwcount CGI script version 2.3 fails to properly validate user-supplied input when handling the "image" parameter. Specifically, it does not sanitize path traversal sequences, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Path Traversal vulnerability
- Improper input validation

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker can read arbitrary GIF files on the server.
- Sensitive information contained in GIF files (charts, drafts, etc.) can be exposed.
- Attackers can potentially bypass user-level authentication to access images if they know the file path.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is exploitable through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the Count.cgi script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- The attacker needs to know the path to the `Count.cgi` script.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the path to the target GIF file.
