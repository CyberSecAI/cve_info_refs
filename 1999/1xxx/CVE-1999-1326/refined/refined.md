- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from a race condition between the SIGPIPE and SIGURG signal handlers in wu-ftpd. When a data connection is closed unexpectedly (triggering SIGPIPE) and an ABOR command with out-of-band signaling is sent simultaneously (triggering SIGURG), the dologout() function, which is part of the SIGPIPE handler, sets the effective UID to 0. Then, before dologout() completes, the SIGURG handler executes a longjmp(), returning execution to the main command loop, which is now running as root because dologout() partially executed.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Race condition:** The core issue is a race condition between the signal handlers. The program doesn't properly handle concurrent signal arrivals during logout procedure, causing an unexpected change of privilege.
    - **Insecure signal handling:** The program does not disable the transflag early enough to prevent an attacker from jumping back to the main loop after the uid has been set to 0.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Privilege escalation:** An attacker can gain root privileges by exploiting this race condition and get the server to return to the main loop while having an effective uid of 0.
    - **Logging bypass:** The xferlog file is closed during the dologout() process, so actions taken after regaining control in the main loop will not be logged.
    - **Resource exhaustion:** The advisory lock on the pid file may not be released. Also, the described behavior of the program may lead to blocked access to future ftp logins and filling up the process table and swap space until the server dies.

- **Attack vectors:**
    -  **Network:** The attack is network-based and the vulnerability can be triggered by any user (including anonymous ones) who can establish an FTP connection with the server.
    - **Signal manipulation:** The attack exploits the timing of SIGPIPE and SIGURG signals.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable wu-ftpd server.
    - The attacker needs to initiate a file transfer.
    - The attacker needs to be able to close the data connection while simultaneously sending the ABOR command through out-of-band signaling to trigger the race condition. This is achievable using a specially crafted client.
