```
Root cause of vulnerability: The Artisoft XtraMail v1.11 software has multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities due to lack of proper bounds checking in the login functions of different services.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Buffer overflow in the POP3 service login function.
- Buffer overflow in the SMTP service login function.
- Buffer overflow in the Control Service login function.

Impact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to a Denial of Service (DoS) against the affected services.

Attack vectors: Sending excessively long strings as input to the login functions of the respective services (POP3, SMTP, Control Service) over the network.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the affected services running on the target machine and send crafted malicious strings to the services.
