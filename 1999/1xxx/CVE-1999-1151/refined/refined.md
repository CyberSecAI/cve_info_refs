- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Microcom 6000 Access Integrator allows an unlimited number of failed login attempts and does not enforce a timeout for telnet connections, leading to denial of service and brute-force password attack vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The system does not limit the duration of open telnet connections, nor does it have a timeout. A malicious user can open four telnet connections and keep them open, thus preventing legitimate users from connecting. The system only allows 4 telnet connections at once.
    - **Brute-force password attack:** The system does not close a connection after a specific number of failed login attempts, allowing attackers to repeatedly try different passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **DoS:** Legitimate users are unable to connect to the Microcom 6000 Access Integrator, disrupting normal operations.
    - **Brute-force password attack:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized administrative access to the device.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **DoS:** Attacker establishes multiple telnet connections (up to the maximum allowed), and keeps them open indefinitely.
    - **Brute-force password attack:** Attacker makes repeated telnet connection attempts with various login credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Microcom 6000 Access Integrator, specifically access to the telnet service. The attacker can be any user with network access, including someone external.
