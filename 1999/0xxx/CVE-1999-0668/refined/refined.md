- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `scriptlet.typelib` ActiveX control was incorrectly marked as "safe for scripting". This allowed it to be called from Internet Explorer without prompting the user for permission.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The control allows local files to be created or modified.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious web page could use the control to perform unauthorized actions on a user's computer, with the same privileges as the user. This could include reading, modifying, or deleting local files.
- **Attack vectors:** A user visits a malicious web page that uses the `scriptlet.typelib` ActiveX control to perform malicious actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page that the victim visits using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer.
