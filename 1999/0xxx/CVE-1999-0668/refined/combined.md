# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-032 - Critical

## Patch Available for "scriptlet.typelib/Eyedog" Vulnerability

Published: August 31, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Revised:** October 12, 1999

**Revised:** September 02, 1999

**Originally Posted:** August 31, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates security vulnerabilities in two ActiveX controls. The net effect of the vulnerabilities is that a web page could take unauthorized action against a person who visited it. Specifically, the web page would be able to do anything on the computer that the user could do.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-032.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-032)

**Issue**

This issue involves two ActiveX controls, scriptlet.typelib and Eyedog. These controls are not in any way related to each other; their only relationship is that both are incorrectly marked as "safe for scripting" and can therefore be called from Internet Explorer.

scriptlet.typelib is a control used by developers to generate Type Libraries for Windows Script Components. It is marked as "safe for scripting", but should not be because it allows local files to be created or modified. The patch removes the "safe for scripting" marking, thereby causing IE to request confirmation from the user before loading the control.

Eyedog is a control used by diagnostic software in Windows. It is marked as "safe for scripting", but should not be because it allows registry information to be queried and machine characteristics to be gathered. In addition, one of the control's methods is vulnerable to a buffer overrun attack. The patch sets the so-called "kill bit", which prevents it from loading within IE.

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and 5.0
