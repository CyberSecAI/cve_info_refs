The provided content is a security advisory (CERT Advisory CA-97.08) that details two vulnerabilities found in the InterNetNews (INN) server software. This content is directly related to the vulnerability described by CVE-1999-0868 which references the same advisory.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Topic 1 (innd):** The `innd` daemon processes "newgroup" and "rmgroup" control messages using a shell script (`parsecontrol`) that uses the shell's `eval` command.  Insufficient sanitization of input from the message before passing it to `eval` allows injection of shell metacharacters.
*   **Topic 2 (ucbmail):**  While INN attempts to remove shell metacharacters, the `ucbmail` program (often used as INN's mailer) lacks similar checks.  INN passes unchecked data to `ucbmail`, which in turn passes it to a shell for processing, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** Both vulnerabilities allow for arbitrary command execution due to a lack of input sanitization before passing data to shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:**  Unauthorized users can execute arbitrary commands on the server running INN.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Commands are executed with the privileges of the `innd` process.
*   **Bypass of Firewalls:** Attacks can originate from remote locations and penetrate firewalls, since news messages can be sent to a news server even if it is behind a firewall.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious News Control Messages:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted news control messages to the vulnerable INN server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Usenet Access:** Attackers need to be able to send messages to the INN server. This generally means having access to Usenet.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send news messages to the target server.
