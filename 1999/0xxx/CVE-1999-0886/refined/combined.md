# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-041 - Critical

## Tool Available for "RASMAN Security Descriptor" Vulnerability

Published: September 30, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** September 30, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® 4.0. The vulnerability could enable a user to execute arbitrary code on a Windows NT machine under certain conditions.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-041.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-041).

**Issue**

The security descriptor that secures the Remote Access Connection Manager, RASMAN.EXE, contains an inappropriate ACE in its DACL and would allow an unprivileged user to levy requests on it via the Service Control Manager. Among the actions that could be requested is to change the location and name of the executable code for the service. By doing so, a malicious user could substitute arbitrary code for the legitimate service, which then would run in a System Context.

A malicious user could only exploit this vulnerability if he or she had a valid userid and password on the target machine. If the machine allowed users to log on from the network, the vulnerability could be remotely exploited. In addition, the arbitrary code could, under certain conditions, reside on a remote machine. A tool is available to reset the permissions to the appropriate value and eliminate the vulnerability, and should be run against any machine that allows unprivileged users to perform either interactive or network logons under any account.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0886](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0886)

**Tool Availability**

* [https:](https://)
  **Note**    The URL above lists the tool as residing in the "Hotfixes-PostSP6" folder even though Service Pack 6 has not shipped as of this writing. This was done because the vulnerability was discovered too late to be corrected in SP6, and the tool therefore needs to be run even on SP6 systems. The [**FAQ**](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-041) contains more information on this subject.
