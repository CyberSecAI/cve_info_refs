- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The security descriptor of the Remote Access Connection Manager (RASMAN.EXE) contained an inappropriate Access Control Entry (ACE) in its Discretionary Access Control List (DACL). This allowed unprivileged users to send requests to it via the Service Control Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. The DACL of the RASMAN service allowed unauthorized users to interact with it through the Service Control Manager.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user could change the location and name of the executable for the service, substituting arbitrary code that would run in the System context, thus gaining elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability could be exploited if a user had valid credentials on the target machine. The attack could be performed remotely if the machine allows network logons. The arbitrary code could also be located on a remote machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid user credentials on the target machine. For remote exploitation, the machine needs to allow network logons.
