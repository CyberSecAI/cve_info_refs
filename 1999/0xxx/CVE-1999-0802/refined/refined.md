- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer exists when handling icons supplied by websites in the Favorites list feature of Internet Explorer 5. A specially crafted, malformed icon can cause a buffer overrun.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability due to unchecked input when processing a malformed icon.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the user's computer.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious website can provide a specially crafted icon that, when added to the user's Favorites list, will trigger the buffer overflow and allow arbitrary code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to make the victim add a malformed icon to their Favorites list in IE 5. This likely means an attacker needs a malicious website.
