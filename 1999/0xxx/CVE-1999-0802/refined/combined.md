# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-018 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Malformed Favorites Icon" Vulnerability

Published: May 27, 1999 | Updated: May 16, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Originally Posted:** May 27, 1999

**Updated:** May 16, 2003

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a single patch that eliminates two security vulnerabilities in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 4.0 and 5. The first potentially could allow arbitrary code to be run on a user's computer. The second potentially could allow the local hard drive to be read. A fully supported patch is available to eliminate both vulnerabilities, and Microsoft recommends that affected customers download and install it, if appropriate.

**Issue**

This update eliminates two vulnerabilities:

* **The "Malformed Favorites Icon" vulnerability.** The Favorites feature allows IE users to keep a list of their favorite web sites. In IE 5, the Favorites list can contain icons that are supplied by the associated web sites. However, there is an unchecked buffer in the implementation. A specially-malformed icon could overrun the buffer and be used to run arbitrary code on the user's computer. This vulnerability only affects IE 5 when run on Windows 95 or 98; it does not affect Windows NT systems.
* **The "Legacy ActiveX Control" vulnerability.** An ActiveX control that was used by previous versions of IE also was included in IE 4.0 and IE 5 even though it is not used by either. It could be misused to allow a web site to read the user's local hard drive. The update eliminates the vulnerability by removing the control.

While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by these vulnerabilities, Microsoft is proactively releasing the patch to allow customers to take appropriate action to protect themselves against it.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and 5.0

  **Note**    The patch, provided below in What Customers Should Do, will determine the version of IE and the platform on which it is installed, and will apply only the appropriate fix. As a result, the single patch below is appropriate for use by customers who are affected by <B>either or both</B> of the vulnerabilities.
