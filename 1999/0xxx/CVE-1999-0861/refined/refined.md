- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A synchronization error in the SSL ISAPI filter when called by a multi-threaded application under specific conditions, leading to a race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition in the SSL ISAPI filter, leading to a plaintext leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A single buffer of plaintext data could be leaked back to its owner. The integrity check of the leaked data would fail, causing the SSL session to immediately collapse.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can only occur when a single user's session is multi-threaded and traffic volumes are extremely high.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The condition cannot be induced by a hostile user and would occur as a target of opportunity.
