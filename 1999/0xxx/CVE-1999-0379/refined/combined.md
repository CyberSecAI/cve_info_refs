# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-007 - Critical

## Patch Available for Taskpads Scripting Vulnerability

Published: February 22, 1999 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** February 22, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the Taskpads feature, which is provided as part of the MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 98 Resource Kit, Windows 98 Resource Kit Sampler, and BackOfficeÂ® Resource Kit, second edition. The vulnerability could allow a malicious web site operator to run executables on the computer of a visiting user. Only customers who have installed one of the affected products and who surf the web using the machines on which they are installed are at risk from this vulnerability.

A fully supported patch is available to remove the Taskpads functionality, and Microsoft recommends that affected customers download and install it.

**Issue**

Taskpads is a feature provided by several Microsoft Windows Resource Kit products, as detailed below in *Affected Software Versions*. It is part of the Resource Kits' Tools Management Console Snap-in, and allows users to view and run Resource Kit Tools via an HTML page rather than through the standard Large Icon, Small, Icon, List, and Detailed Views. A vulnerability exists because certain methods provided by Taskpads are incorrectly marked as "safe for scripting" and can be misused by a web site operator to invoke executables on a visiting user's workstation without their knowledge or permission.

The affected products are, by default, not installed on Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NTÂ®. The Windows 98 Resource Kit and Resource Kit Sampler can only be installed on Windows 98. The BackOffice Resource Kit can be installed on Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows NT, but is most commonly installed on Windows NT servers, which, per recommended security practices, usually will not be used for web surfing.

While there have not been any reports of customers being adversely affected by these problems, Microsoft is releasing a patch to proactively address this issue. The patch for this issue works by removing the Taskpads functionality, which is rarely used. It does not affect any other features of the affected products.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows 98 Resource Kit
* Microsoft Windows 98 Resource Kit Sampler (included as part of Windows 98 but not installed by default)
* Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, second edition

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0379](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0379)
