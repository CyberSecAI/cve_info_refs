Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-1999-0278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how IIS parses file names when handling NTFS alternate data streams. IIS does not properly canonicalize filenames, allowing access to alternate data streams, specifically the `$DATA` stream, which contains the primary file content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access:**  IIS improperly handles NTFS alternate data streams, allowing direct access to the contents of files through their `$DATA` stream. This bypasses the intended execution of script files (like .asp) by directly returning the source code.
*   **Bypassed Application Mappings:**  Normally, files like .asp are executed by a script engine. However, by specifying the alternate data stream, an attacker can bypass this and obtain the plain text content of these files.
*  **Incorrect access controls:**  While read access is needed to trigger the vulnerability, the fact that read access was not required for .asp files but could be granted to web users was a misconfiguration issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read the source code of script files (e.g., ASP files). This can expose sensitive information such as embedded passwords, database connection strings, API keys, or proprietary business logic.
*  **No Code Execution:** The vulnerability does not allow the attacker to alter server-side code or execute arbitrary code. The exposure is limited to reading the content of files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Browser Request:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific URL request to the IIS server, including the alternate data stream identifier within the file path.
*   **Direct File Access:** The attacker must know the name of the file they want to access

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IIS server.
*  **File Read Permissions:** The user must have read access to the targeted file according to the ACLs.
*   **Knowledge of File Names:** The attacker must know the name of the file and the alternate stream they are targeting (specifically the `$DATA` stream).
*   **NTFS File System:**  The targeted file must reside on an NTFS partition.

**Affected Software Versions:**

*   Microsoft Windows NT Server's Internet Information Server versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0
*   Microsoft Peer Web Server versions 2.0, 3.0
*   Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 on Windows NT 4.0 Workstation

**Mitigations:**

*   **Hotfix:** Microsoft provided hotfixes for IIS versions 3.0 and 4.0.
*   **Restrict File Permissions:** Remove read access to script files (like .asp) for non-administrative users, ensuring they only have execute permissions.
*   **Application Mapping Modifications:** Modify Application Maps in IIS 4.0 to account for the existence of alternate data streams.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Review user and group access to the web server, and implement auditing on sensitive files.
