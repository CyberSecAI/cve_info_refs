Here is a breakdown of the relevant information for CVE-1999-0145:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The "wizard" mode in older versions of sendmail had a vulnerability due to incorrect initialization and handling of the wizard password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The pointer to the hashed password `char *wizpw = NULL;` was initialized to NULL which placed the variable in the data section and not the bss section of the binary when the configuration was "frozen". This resulted in the password pointer not being written to the frozen config file, effectively disabling the password protection of the wizard mode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could connect to the mailer port, type "wiz", and gain elevated privileges, including an interactive shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- Connecting to the mailer port and typing "wiz".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to connect to the mailer port of the vulnerable sendmail server.
