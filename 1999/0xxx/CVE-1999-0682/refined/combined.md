# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-027 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Encapsulated SMTP Address" Vulnerability

Published: August 06, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** August 06, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® ExchangeÂ® Server. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform mail relaying via an Exchange server that is configured to act as a gateway for other Exchange sites, using the Internet Messaging Service.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-027.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-027)

**Issue**

Exchange Server implements features designed to defeat "mail relaying", a practice in which an attacker causes an e-mail server to forward mail from the attacker, as though the server were the sender of the mail. However, a vulnerability exists in this feature, and could allow an attacker to circumvent the anti-relaying features in an Internet-connected Exchange Server.

The vulnerability lies in the way that site-to-site relaying is performed via SMTP. Encapsulated SMTP addresses could be used to send mail to any desired e-mail address. The patch eliminates the vulnerability by making encapsulated SMTP addresses subject to the same anti-relay protections as non-encapsulated SMTP addresses.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0682](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0682)
