- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how Exchange Server handles encapsulated SMTP addresses when performing site-to-site relaying via SMTP. The server fails to apply the same anti-relay protections to encapsulated SMTP addresses as it does to non-encapsulated ones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of encapsulated SMTP addresses, which allows the circumvention of anti-relaying features. This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform mail relaying through a vulnerable Exchange server. This means the attacker can send emails as if they originated from the compromised server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending emails with encapsulated SMTP addresses to an Exchange Server configured as a gateway.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send emails to a vulnerable Exchange server configured to act as a gateway for other Exchange sites. The attacker must also be able to craft emails with encapsulated SMTP addresses.
