- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Word 97 does not warn users when opening a document that is linked to a template containing macros, even though the document itself does not contain macros.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper macro warning handling when a document is associated with a template that contains macros.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious macro code can be executed without user warning, potentially allowing attackers to damage or retrieve data on the user's system.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malicious Word document as an email attachment or hosting it on a website controlled by the attacker. The malicious document is linked to a template containing the malicious macro code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Word document and a corresponding template that contains a malicious macro and deliver this to the target user.
