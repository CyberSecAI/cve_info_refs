# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-002 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Word 97 Template" Vulnerability

Published: January 21, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** January 21, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that fixes a vulnerability in Word 97 which could permit macros to run without warning the user when the user opens a document based on a template containing macros. A malicious hacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause malicious macro code to be run without warning if a user opens a Word attachment that was sent by a malicious hacker, or posted on a web site controlled by the malicious hacker. This malicious macro could possibly be used to damage or retrieve data on a user's system.

A fully supported patch is available to fix this vulnerability, and Microsoft recommends that customers download and install it to protect their computers.

**Issue**

Now available for download, the Word 97 Template Security Patch addresses a vulnerability that could allow malicious macro code to be run in a Word 97 document without warning a user when the user opens the document.

A standard safety feature of Word 97 is that it warns users when a document containing macros is opened; however, if that document does not itself contain macros, but rather is linked to a template that does contains macros, no warning is issued. A malicious hacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause malicious macro code to run without warning if a user opens a Word document attached to an email sent by the malicious hacker, or if the user opens a Word document on a web site controlled by the malicious hacker. This malicious macro could possibly be used to damage or retrieve data on a user's system.

The Word 97 Template Security Patch prevents a hacker from exploiting this vulnerability. After installing the patch, users will be warned before they launch a document based on a template that contains macros. Installing the patch will not disable the use of templates or macros on templates.

While there have not been any reports of customers being adversely affected by these problems, Microsoft is releasing a patch to address any risks posed by this issue.
