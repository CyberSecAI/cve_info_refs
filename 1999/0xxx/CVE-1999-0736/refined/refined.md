- **Root cause of vulnerability:** File viewers included in Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and Site Server do not restrict which files a web site visitor can view. These viewers were intended for viewing sample code for learning purposes, not for production servers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of access control in file viewers (specifically ShowCode.asp, ViewCode.asp, Code.asp, and CodeBrws.asp) allowing unauthorized file access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can view files on the server by guessing or knowing the file names, potentially exposing sensitive information, including source code, configuration files, or other data accessible via the file system. This access is read-only, meaning attackers cannot modify or create new files.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends HTTP requests to the vulnerable file viewer scripts (ShowCode.asp, ViewCode.asp, Code.asp, CodeBrws.asp) with the file path they wish to view.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server and know or guess the names of the files they want to access. They are also restricted by the normal Windows NT file permission ACLs. They can only read files for which they have read access. The files are limited to the same disk partition as the currently displayed web page.
