# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-052 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Legacy Credential Caching" Vulnerability

Published: November 29, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** November 29, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 95 and 98 caused by a legacy mechanism for caching network security credentials. The vulnerability could allow a user's plaintext network password to be retrieved from the cache.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/fq99-052.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-052).

**Issue**

Windows for Workgroups provided a RAM-based caching mechanism that cached the user's plaintext network credentials for use by real-mode command-line networking utilities. Part of this mechanism was carried forward into the Windows 95 and 98 designs, even though it is not used by either. A malicious user could query this mechanism to obtain the network credentials of the last person to use the machine for network access, as long as they had physical access to the machine and it had not been rebooted since the last networking session.
