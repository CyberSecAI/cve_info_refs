- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A legacy RAM-based caching mechanism, intended for Windows for Workgroups, that cached plaintext network credentials, was carried forward into Windows 95 and 98. This mechanism was not actively used by these operating systems, but remained accessible.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the presence of a legacy mechanism that stores network credentials in plaintext. This mechanism can be queried by a malicious user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with physical access to a vulnerable machine could retrieve the plaintext network credentials of the last user who accessed network resources.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires physical access to the computer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the vulnerable machine and the machine must not have been rebooted since the last network session.
