# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-059 - Important

## Patch Available for "Malformed TDS Packet Header" Vulnerability

Published: December 20, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** December 20, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® SQL Serverâ¢ 7.0. The vulnerability could cause a SQL server to crash.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-059.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-059).

**Issue**

If a specially-malformed TDS packet is sent to a SQL server, it can cause the server to crash. This vulnerability would not allow any inappropriate access to the data on the server, nor would it allow a malicious user to usurp any administrative control on the machine. An affected machine could be put back into service by restarting the SQL service. This vulnerability could only be remotely exploited if port 1433 were open at the firewall.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft SQL Server 7.0

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0999](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0999)
