- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially-malformed TDS packet sent to a SQL server can cause the server to crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Malformed TDS packet handling.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS). The SQL server crashes and needs to be restarted to restore service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially-malformed TDS packet to the SQL server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the SQL server, which typically listens on port 1433.  The port must be open at the firewall to be exploited remotely.
