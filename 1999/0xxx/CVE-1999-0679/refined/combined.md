* ## Data breach

  Due to an insecure password on an old admin account, hackers were able to retrieve a data dump of the forum database. At this point, it is safe to assume that all passwords are compromised. All passwords have been reset to a random string, you will need to perform a ~~[url=http://forum.efnet.org/ucp.php?mode=sendpassword]~~password reset[/url] in order to login.

* ## Connections tagged as TOR exit node by mistake

  Some EFnet servers mistakenly tagged all incoming connections as TOR Exit node by mistake and issued a kline. The reason for this is that the blacklist provider ahbl.org have decided to shut down the service and returns positive responses for the queries our monitoring bots sends. So if you unexpectanly got tagged as TOR exit node the last days that might be a false positive.
