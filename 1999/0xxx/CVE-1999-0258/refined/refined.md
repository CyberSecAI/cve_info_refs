- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the TCP/IP stack of unpatched Windows 95 and Windows NT systems, specifically related to the handling of fragmented UDP packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how the TCP/IP stack reassembles fragmented UDP packets. Malformed UDP packets are sent after an initial DNS packet, triggering a flaw during the reassembly process, which corrupts the stack, causing a crash or reboot.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, typically resulting in a blue screen of death (BSOD) or system reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted over a network using a two-packet sequence involving fragmented UDP packets. The first packet uses the DNS port (port 53) and the second packet completes the attack by being a malformed UDP packet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target system. The attacker does not need to be on the same local network.
