# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-044 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Excel SYLK" Vulnerability

Published: October 20, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted**: October 20, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates two vulnerabilities in MicrosoftÂ® Excel 97 and 2000 that could allow macros to run without warning under certain conditions.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-044.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-044).

**Issue**

The primary vulnerability addressed by this patch is the "Excel SYLK" vulnerability. Symbolic Link (SYLK) files can contain macros; if such a file were opened in Excel 97 or 2000, the macro would run without asking for the user's permission. These macros could take any action on the computer that the user could take.

This patch also eliminates a vulnerability involving how Excel 97 imports macros created by Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro Pro. When such a macro is imported, Excel 97 runs it without asking for the user's permission. These macros could be used to delete files on the user's computer, but could take no other action.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Excel 97, whether shipped alone or as part of Office 97.
* Microsoft Excel 2000, whether shipped alone or as part of Office 2000.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0794](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0794)
