Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in how Microsoft Excel 97 and 2000 handle Symbolic Link (SYLK) files and imported macros from Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro Pro. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that Excel doesn't prompt users for permission before executing macros embedded within these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Unrestricted Macro Execution from SYLK Files:**  Excel 97 and 2000 automatically run macros contained in SYLK files without user interaction or warning.
2.  **Unrestricted Macro Execution of Imported Lotus 1-2-3/Quattro Pro Macros (Excel 97 only):** Excel 97 automatically runs macros imported from Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro Pro files without user interaction or warning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full system compromise:**  Macros executed through the SYLK vulnerability could take any action on the user's computer that the user themselves is capable of. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, malware installation, and complete system compromise.
*   **File Deletion (for Lotus 1-2-3/Quattro Pro Macro Import in Excel 97):**  Macros imported from Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro Pro could delete files on the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious SYLK files:** Attackers can craft malicious SYLK files containing harmful macros and distribute them to victims, such as via email attachments or downloads from malicious websites.
*   **Malicious Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro Pro files (Excel 97 specific):** Attackers can create malicious files in Lotus 1-2-3 or Quattro Pro formats, containing malicious macros. When imported into Excel 97, the macros are automatically run.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted SYLK file or a Lotus 1-2-3/Quattro Pro file (for Excel 97) to the victim.
*   The victim must open the malicious file using a vulnerable version of Excel (97 or 2000).
