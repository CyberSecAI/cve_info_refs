# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-014 - Critical

## Patch Available for Excel 97 Virus Warning Vulnerabilities

Published: May 07, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** May 7, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates vulnerabilities in the MicrosoftÂ® Excel 97 virus warning mechanism. The patch is fully supported, and Microsoft recommends that affected customers download and install it, if appropriate.

**Issue**

Microsoft Excel 97 provides a feature that warns the user before launching an external file that could potentially contain a virus or other malicious software. This feature allows the user to weigh the risk of opening the file, based on its origin, the network it is located on and the security practices in operation there, the sensitivity of the data on the user's computer, and other factors.

However, certain scenarios have been identified that could be misused to bypass the warning mechanism. In general, they require the use of infrequently-combined features and commands, and are unlikely to be encountered in normal use. This patch addresses these issues so that they cannot be taken advantage of by a malicious user.

While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by any of the vulnerabilities eliminated by the patch, Microsoft is proactively releasing the patch to allow customers to take appropriate action to protect themselves against it. These fixes are already built into Excel 2000 and users of that product will not need to download this patch.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Excel 97

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0717](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0717)
