- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the Terminal Server's behavior of performing resource-intensive operations to prepare for a new terminal connection *before* authenticating the request. This allows an attacker to exploit this by sending numerous bogus connection requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the lack of authentication before resource-intensive connection processing. This makes the server vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The server's memory resources can be consumed, leading to performance degradation and, in extreme cases, a server crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, involving sending a large number of bogus connection requests to the Terminal Server over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the Terminal Server. No authentication is required for the initial stage of the attack.
