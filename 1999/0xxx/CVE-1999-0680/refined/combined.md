# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-028 - Important

## Patch Available for "Terminal Server Connection Request Flooding" Vulnerability

Published: August 09, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** August 09, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability that could pose a denial-of-service threat to MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® Terminal Servers. Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-028.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-028)

**Issue**

When a request to open a new terminal connection is received by a Terminal Server, the server undertakes a resource-intensive series of operations to prepare for the connection. It does this before authenticating the request. This would allow an attacker to mount a denial of service attack by levying a large number of bogus connection requests and consuming all memory on the Terminal Server.

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely if connection requests are not filtered. In extreme cases, the server could crash in the face of such an attack; in other cases, normal processing would return when the attack ceased. The patch works by causing the server to require authentication before processing the connection request.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0680](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0680)
