- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher allows an attacker to decode SSL encrypted transactions by exploiting weaknesses in the server-side implementation of the protocol.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way server software handles error messages during SSL transactions. By sending a large number of specially crafted messages to the server and analyzing the responses, an attacker can decrypt recorded SSL transactions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially decrypt sensitive information from recorded SSL transactions. However, this would only affect single recorded transactions and not give the attacker an advantage in decoding other transactions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must first record an encrypted SSL transaction between a client and a server. Then, they send a large number of crafted messages to the server and analyze responses to decode the transaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to observe the encrypted transaction between a client and a server. They also need the ability to send a large number of messages to the server and analyze the responses.
