Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the insecure storage of sensitive customer information (including credit card numbers, names, addresses, phone numbers, and order details) by various commercial and freeware shopping cart applications.
*   These applications create world-readable files within the web server's document tree that contain this information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary weakness is the creation of world-readable files, making the sensitive data accessible to anyone with access to the web server.
*   **Clear Text Storage:** The data was stored in clear text, making it easily readable upon access.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** No proper access control mechanisms were in place to protect these files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Complete exposure of customer information, including highly sensitive data like credit card numbers, allowing for identity theft and financial fraud.
*   **Financial Loss:** Potential for significant financial loss to both customers and businesses.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Severe damage to the reputation of affected businesses.
*   **Fraud:** Allows attackers to make purchases using stolen credit card data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Search Engine Indexing:** The world-readable files were indexed by search engines, making it easy for attackers to locate them.
*   **Direct Access:** Attackers could also potentially directly access these files if they knew the specific paths and file names.
*   **Web Browsers:** The data could be accessed by anyone with a web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** Attackers only needed basic knowledge of search engines and how shopping carts are typically structured, which are readily available.
*   **Internet Access:** An internet connection was the main requirement.
*   **No Prior System Access:** Attackers did not require any prior access to the target systems. They could leverage world readable files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content highlights the lack of understanding and response from some vendors when notified about the issue.
*   The author attempted to get credit card companies involved but they were unwilling to take direct action.
*   The author chose to publicize the issue through the media to potentially reach a wider audience and encourage a faster response.
*   The content does not name the specific shopping carts affected, but mentions that a number of different carts were vulnerable.
*   The timeframe for this vulnerability is specifically mentioned as April 1999
