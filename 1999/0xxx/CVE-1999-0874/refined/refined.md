- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists in the filter DLLs for .HTR, .STM, and .IDC file types in Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 (IIS 4.0).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the processing of .HTR, .STM, and .IDC files by IIS 4.0.
- **Impact of exploitation:** 
  - Denial of Service: A malformed request for .HTR, .STM, or .IDC files can cause a buffer overflow, leading to an IIS crash. The server would need an IIS restart to resume service.
  - Arbitrary Code Execution: A carefully crafted file request could cause arbitrary code execution on the server via a buffer overrun.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malformed HTTP request targeting .HTR, .STM, or .IDC files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IIS server. No special privileges or access to the server's file system is mentioned.
