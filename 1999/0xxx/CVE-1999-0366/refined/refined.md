- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic error in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4's authentication process. When a user's password was last changed via a downlevel client (DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 or Macintosh), a null value was stored in the "NT hash" field. The authentication process incorrectly allows a null "NT hash" value to be used for authentication from Windows NT systems, resulting in the system using the "LM hash" and allowing a blank password to be used if the NT hash was null.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect handling of null "NT hash" values during authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could log on interactively and connect to network shares using a blank password for accounts whose password was last changed from a downlevel client.
- **Attack vectors:** Interactive logon or network share connection attempts from a Windows NT system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must target a Windows NT system where at least one user account password has been last changed from a downlevel client. The attacker needs to have network access or the ability to attempt an interactive logon.
