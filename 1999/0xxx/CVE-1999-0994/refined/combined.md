# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-056 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Syskey Keystream Reuse" Vulnerability

Published: December 16, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** December 16, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in Syskey, a utility that provides additional protection for MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® password databases. The vulnerability allows a particular cryptanalytic attack to be effective against Syskey, significantly reducing the strength of the protection it offers. The patch eliminates the vulnerability and restores strong protection to the password database.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-056.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-056).

**Issue**

Syskey is a utility that strongly encrypts the hashed password information in the SAM database in order to protect it against offline password cracking attacks. However, Syskey reuses the keystream used to perform some of the encryption. This significantly reduces the strength of the protection it provides by enabling a well-known cryptanalytic attack to be used against it.

A patch is available that eliminates the key reuse vulnerability and again makes it computationally infeasible to mount a brute-force attack against the SAM database when Syskey has been applied.
