- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Syskey utility, designed to strongly encrypt password hashes in the SAM database, reuses the keystream during encryption. This key reuse weakens the encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Keystream reuse in the Syskey encryption process. This makes the system susceptible to cryptanalytic attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability significantly reduces the strength of the protection provided by Syskey, making the SAM database vulnerable to offline password cracking attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** A cryptanalytic attack can be used against the reused keystream, making brute-force attacks against the SAM database computationally feasible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to perform a cryptanalytic attack on the SAM database, which is usually done offline after obtaining a copy of the database.
