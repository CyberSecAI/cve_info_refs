This content does not directly relate to CVE-1999-0526. The vulnerability described is related to insecure default configurations of X servers, which is a broader issue and is documented in Vulnerability Note VU#704969.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure default configuration of X server software, allowing connections from any remote X client.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Default configuration that allows any remote X client to connect to the X server.
*   Use of `xhost +` command which enables insecure access.
*   Lack of proper access control mechanisms.
*   Plaintext transmission of Xauthority secrets over the network (if Xauthority is used).

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Attackers can monitor keystrokes.
*   Attackers can inject commands into X window sessions.
*   Potential to gain privileges of the user running the insecure X server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-based attacks where attackers can connect to the X server over the network.
*   Exploiting the insecure configuration to inject X events.
*   Sniffing Xauthority secrets on the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Network access to the vulnerable X server.
*   Ability to connect to the X server, if remote.
*   Ability to execute commands that inject X windows events.
*   If sniffing Xauthority secrets, network monitoring capabilities are required.
