- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the implementation of the `LsaLookupSids()` function within the Windows NT Local Security Authority (LSA) causes it to incorrectly handle certain types of invalid arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of invalid arguments in the `LsaLookupSids()` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious user can cause the LSA to crash, preventing the machine from performing useful work, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. The machine would need to be rebooted to restore service, with a loss of any unsaved work.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by making an affected call to the `LsaLookupSids()` function with invalid arguments.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to make an affected call to the vulnerable function. Remote attacks are possible, but not if NetBIOS is filtered at the firewall.
