# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-042 - Important

## Patch Available for "IFRAME ExecCommand" Vulnerability

Published: October 11, 1999 | Updated: November 04, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** October 11, 1999

**Updated:** October 15, 1999

**Re-released:** November 04, 1999

**Summary**

On October 11, 1999, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin, in order to advise customers of a workaround for a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow a malicious web site operator to read files on the computer of a user who visited the site, under certain circumstances. On October 15, 1999, Microsoft released a patch that eliminated the vulnerability.

However, a regression error was subsequently discovered and corrected. The bulletin has been re-released to provide a corrected version of the patch. The regression affects only IE 5 users; IE 4 users do not need to re-apply the fix for this issue. The FAQ discusses the regression error in more detail.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at

[https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-042.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-042).

**Issue**

The Internet Explorer security model normally restricts the Document.ExecCommand() method to prevent it from taking inappropriate action on a user's computer. However, at least one of these restrictions is not present if the method is invoked on an IFRAME. This could allow a malicious web site operator to read the contents of files on visiting users' computers, if he or she knew the name of the file and the folder in which it resided. The vulnerability would not allow the malicious user to list the contents of folders, create, modify or delete files, or to usurp any administrative control over the machine.

A patch that corrects this vulnerability is available at the location discussed below. This patch also includes the previously-released fix for the **"**[**Download Behavior**](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms99-040)**"** vulnerability.
