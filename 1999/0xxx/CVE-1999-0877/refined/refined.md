- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Document.ExecCommand()` method in Internet Explorer did not have all its security restrictions enforced when invoked on an IFRAME element.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A missing security restriction on the `Document.ExecCommand()` method when used within an IFRAME.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious website operator could potentially read the contents of files on a visiting user's computer if they knew the file's name and path.
- **Attack vectors**: By hosting a malicious website containing a crafted IFRAME, an attacker could attempt to use the vulnerable `Document.ExecCommand()` method to access local files on a visitor's machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a website that the victim visits using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. The attacker must also know the full path and name of the files they are trying to access on the victim's machine.
