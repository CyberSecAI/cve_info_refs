- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially-malformed image header in an executable file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of malformed image headers in executable files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: System failure (crash), requiring a reboot to restore service. Any unsaved work in progress is lost. This results in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Executing a file with a malformed image header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to execute the crafted file on the target machine.
