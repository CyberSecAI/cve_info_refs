- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An untrusted scripted paste vulnerability exists within the MSHTML.DLL parsing engine of Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows a script to paste a filename into the file upload control, which should only be possible with explicit user action.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could use this vulnerability to paste a file path into a file upload control. Then, when the user submits the form, the file specified would be sent to the attacker's server without any warning if the user has disabled the default warning for unencrypted form submissions.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious website operator can use a script to paste a filename into the file upload control, then trick the user into submitting the form, which would send the file to the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website or control a website that a victim visits, and have the ability to execute Javascript on the victim's browser. The user would have to have disabled the warning that is displayed when submitting unencrypted forms.
