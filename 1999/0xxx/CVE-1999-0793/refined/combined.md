# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-043 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Javascript Redirect" Vulnerability

Published: October 18, 1999 | Updated: November 17, 1999

**Version:** 1.1

**Originally Posted:** October 18, 1999

**Re-released:** November 17, 1999

**Summary**

On October 18, 1999, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin, in order to advise customers of a workaround for a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow a malicious web site operator to read files on the computer of a user who visited the site, under certain circumstances. Microsoft has completed a patch that completely eliminates the vulnerability, and has re-released this bulletin in order to advise customers of its availability.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-043.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-043).

**Issue**

Client-local data that is displayed in the browser window can be made available to the server by using a redirect to a Javascript applet running in the same window. This in effect bypasses cross-domain security and makes the data available to the applet, which could then send the data to a hostile server. This could allow a malicious web site operator to read the contents of files on visiting users' computers, if he or she knew the name of the file and the folder in which it resided. The vulnerability would not allow the malicious user to list the contents of folders, create, modify or delete files, or to usurp any administrative control over the machine.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 and 5.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0793](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0793)
