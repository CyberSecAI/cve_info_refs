- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer allows a malicious website operator to read files on a user's computer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Client-local data displayed in the browser window can be made available to the server by using a redirect to a JavaScript applet running in the same window. This bypasses cross-domain security, making the data available to the applet.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious website operator can read the contents of files on visiting users' computers if they know the file's name and location. The vulnerability does not allow listing folder contents, creating, modifying, or deleting files, or gaining administrative control.
- **Attack vectors**: A user visits a malicious website. The website uses a javascript redirect to an applet which can then read local files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to host a malicious website and know the name and path of a file on the victim's computer.
