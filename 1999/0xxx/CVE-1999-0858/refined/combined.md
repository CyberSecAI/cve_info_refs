# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-054 - Critical

## Patch Available for "WPAD Spoofing" Vulnerability

Published: December 01, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** December 01, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a version upgrade that eliminates a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 5. Under very specific conditions, the vulnerability could allow a malicious user to provide proxy settings to web clients in another network.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletins/fq99-054.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-054).

**Issue**

The IE 5 Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) feature enables web clients to automatically detect proxy settings without user intervention. The algorithm used by WPAD prepends the hostname "wpad" to the fully-qualified domain name and progressively removes subdomains until it either finds a WPAD server answering the domain name or reaches the third-level domain. For instance, web clients in the domain a.b.microsoft.com would query wpad.a.b.microsoft, wpad.b.microsoft.com, then wpad.microsoft.com. A vulnerability arises because in international usage, the third-level domain may not be trusted. A malicious user could set up a WPAD server and serve proxy configuration commands of his or her choice.

**Affected Software Versions**
