- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) feature in Internet Explorer 5 automatically detects proxy settings. The vulnerability arises from the way WPAD constructs domain names to search for WPAD servers. It prepends "wpad" to the fully qualified domain name and progressively removes subdomains until a WPAD server is found or it reaches the third-level domain. In international usage, the third-level domain may not be trusted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient trust in third-level domains during WPAD discovery.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can set up a WPAD server on a third-level domain and provide arbitrary proxy configuration commands to web clients, potentially redirecting their traffic through malicious proxies.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user sets up a rogue WPAD server on a third-level domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control a server on a third-level domain that can respond to WPAD queries. They also need to be in a position where their rogue WPAD server can be reached by the targeted clients.
