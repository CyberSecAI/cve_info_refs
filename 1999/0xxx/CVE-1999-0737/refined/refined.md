- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The file viewer tools included in Microsoft Site Server and Internet Information Server do not restrict which files a web site visitor can view.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate access controls in file viewer tools (specifically `ViewCode.asp`).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can view files on the server if they know or guess the file names and have read access based on Windows NT ACLs.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote access via HTTP requests to the vulnerable file viewer tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
    - The attacker needs to know or guess the name of the file they wish to view.
    - The attacker must have the necessary Windows NT ACLs permissions to read the file.
