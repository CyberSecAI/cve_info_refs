Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the "download behavior" feature of Internet Explorer 5, which is a DHTML behavior that allows web pages to download files for client-side scripting.
*   The intended design was to restrict file downloads to the website's domain, preventing access to local files. However, a server-side redirect can bypass this restriction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Bypassed Domain Restriction:** The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass the domain restriction intended for the "download behavior" feature by using a server-side redirect. This allows a malicious website to initiate downloads from locations outside of the website's domain, including the local file system.
*   **Arbitrary File Access:**  The `startDownload` method of the "download behavior", paired with the redirect, allowed the attacker to specify a local file path. The callback function receives the file contents as a parameter, which can then be manipulated by the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Exposure:** A malicious web site can read arbitrary files from the victim's local system, including potentially sensitive information. The file content is made available to the attacker through the callback function.
*   **Potential Data Exfiltration:**  The malicious callback function can perform arbitrary actions with the file content, including sending the file data to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:**  An attacker hosts a malicious web site containing code that leverages the vulnerable "download behavior."
*   **Server-Side Redirect:** The malicious website uses a server-side redirect to force Internet Explorer to download a local file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server Control:** The attacker needs to control a web server to host the malicious content and perform the redirect.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs to lure victims to visit the malicious web site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability primarily impacts workstations connected to the Internet.
*   The vulnerability was initially addressed with a workaround before a patch was released.
