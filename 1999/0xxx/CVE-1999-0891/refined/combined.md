## Internet Explorer DHTML"Download Behavior" can be tricked into exposing local files

#### Vulnerability Note VU#37828

Original Release Date: 2001-08-15 | Last Revised: 2001-08-21

---

### Overview

The download behavior of Internet Explorer 5.0 can be used to perform arbitrary operations on local files.

### Description

| Internet Explorer 5.0 includes a dynamic HTML (DHTML) behavior called "download behavior." A "behavior" is a software object that specifies some behavior of a web page element, for example, the behavior of an object when the mouse is placed over the object. Some behaviors are included by default in IE 5, including the download behavior. This feature allows a web site to download files for use in a client side script. The "start download" method of the "download" behavior has the following syntax:*oDownload.startDownload (sUrl, fpCallback)*sURL is a string specifying the file, and fpCallback is a pointer to a function to handle the downloaded file. The contents of the file are returned to fpCallback as its only parameter. sURL is supposed to originate in the same domain as the web site. However, you can construct the web site so that it redirects the browser to a local file (if the name of the file can be guessed or is known). The callback function can then perform arbitrary operations on the file, including possibly sending it to the intruder.

### Impact

| Malicious web site operators can retrieve files from your system. |

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-040 - Important

## Patch Available for "Download Behavior" Vulnerability

Published: September 28, 1999 | Updated: October 12, 1999

**Version:** 1.2

**Originally Posted:** September 28, 1999

**Updated:** October 08, 1999

**Revised:** October 12, 1999

**Summary**

On September 28, 1999, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin, in order to provide a workaround for a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 5 that could allow a malicious web site operator to read files on the computer of a person who visited the site. Microsoft has completed a patch that completely eliminates the vulnerability, and has re-released this bulletin in order to advise customers of its availability.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-040.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-040).

**Issue**

IE 5 includes a feature called "download behavior" that allows web page authors to download files for use in client-side script. By design, a web site should only be able to download files that reside in its domain; this prevents client-side code from exposing files on the user's machine or local intranet to the web site. However, a server-side redirect can be used to bypass this restriction, thereby enabling a malicious web site operator to read files on the user's machine or the user's local intranet. This vulnerability would chiefly affect workstations that are connected to the Internet.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 5
