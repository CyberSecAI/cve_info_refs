Its known, its fixed in current setups

Netkit 0.08/9 telnetd do not pass any environment variables,

libc5.4 is immune, RedHat has been shipping the fixed libc5.3.12 for a long
time, and all the vendors I had security contacts for where told ages ago.
If they haven't fixed it then Im disappointed with them, they dont have
an excuse. That libc5.3.12 unpatched also has other fun bugs with buffer
overruns in libc some in the BSD stuff akin to the BSD bugs in rcmd() etc.
