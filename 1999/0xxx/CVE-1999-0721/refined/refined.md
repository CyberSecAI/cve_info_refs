- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Certain API methods within the Local Security Authority (LSA) API do not correctly handle specific types of invalid arguments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation within the LSA API. Specifically, certain API methods fail to handle malformed requests, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malformed request to the LSA service causes it to stop responding, requiring a system restart to restore service. This constitutes a denial-of-service vulnerability. The vulnerability does not allow for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malformed request to the LSA API, either locally or remotely via RPC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to send a malformed request to the LSA API, either locally or remotely. Specific permissions are not mentioned, but it is implied that access to the LSA API is required.
