# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-020 - Important

## Patch Available for "Malformed LSA Request" Vulnerability

Published: June 23, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** June 23, 1999

**Revised:** July 20, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability that poses a denial of service threat to MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® servers and workstations. A malformed request to the Local Security Authority (LSA) service will causes the service to stop responding, requiring the computer to be restarted.

A fully supported patch is available to eliminate the vulnerability, and Microsoft recommends that affected customers download and install it, if appropriate.

**Issue**

Windows NT provides the ability to manage user privileges programmatically via the Local Security Authority (LSA) API. The API allows a program to query user names, modify privileges, and change other elements of the security policy, subject to the program's authorizations. Calls to the LSA API can be made from either the local machine or remotely via RPC.

Certain API methods do not correctly handle certain types of invalid arguments. The vulnerability is a denial of service threat only, and service can be restored by restarting the machine. There is no capability to use this vulnerability to obtain unauthorized services from LSA.

While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by this vulnerability, Microsoft is proactively releasing this patch to allow customers to take appropriate action to protect themselves against it.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition, 4.0
