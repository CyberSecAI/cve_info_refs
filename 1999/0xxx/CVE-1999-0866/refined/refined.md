    *   `/usr/lib/libX11.a`
    *   `/usr/lib/libXt.a`
    *   `/usr/lib/libXmu.a`
    *   `/usr/lib/libXaw.a`
    *   `/usr/bin/X11/xterm`
    *   `/usr/bin/X11/xload`
    *   `/usr/bin/X11/scoterm`
    *   `/usr/bin/X11/scolock`
    *   `/usr/bin/X11/scosession`
    *   `/usr/bin/X11/scologin`
    *   `/usr/lpd/remote/rlpstat`
    *   `/usr/lpd/remote/cancel`
    *  `/usr/lpd/remote/lpmove`

    *   `/usr/bin/X11/Xsco` also has buffer overflows

    *   **Weaknesses:** Classic buffer overflow vulnerabilities in various programs and libraries
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable program. This could lead to privilege escalation and system compromise.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Exploiting these programs via local or remote access, where applicable.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker would need to be able to provide specially crafted input to the vulnerable programs.

*   **Algorithmic Vulnerabilities:**
    *   `/etc/sysadm.d/bin/userOsa`: Can improperly write to privileged files.
    *   `/usr/bin/X11/Xsco`: Can improperly read privileged files. Also has buffer overflows.
    *   `/bin/hello`: Can improperly access privileged devices. Allows transmission of dangerous characters.
    *   `/bin/write`: Allows transmission of dangerous characters.
    *    `/bin/login`: Corrupt `/etc/dialups` causes login failure. Insufficient error checking.

    *   **Weaknesses:** Improper access control, insufficient input validation, and insufficient error handling.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to potentially read and modify privileged data, gain access to privileged devices, and cause denial-of-service.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Exploiting these programs locally.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have local access.

**UnixWare 7 Vulnerabilities (Mentioned but not detailed):**

*   **UnixWare pkg\* command exploits:**
    *   **Weaknesses:** Unknown based on the provided text
    *   **Impact:** Unknown based on the provided text
    *   **Attack vectors:** Unknown based on the provided text
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Unknown based on the provided text
*   **UnixWare coredumps following symlinks:**
    *   **Weaknesses:** Issues with core dumping behavior related to symlinks
    *  **Impact:** Possibly allows attackers to manipulate the core dump generation process, potentially revealing sensitive information or causing denial of service.
    *   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can manipulate symbolic links.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can manipulate symbolic links.
*  **Fundamental flaw in UnixWare 7 security:**
   *  **Weaknesses:**  General security flaw in UnixWare 7's security model.
   *   **Impact:** Unknown based on the provided text.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Unknown based on the provided text
   *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Unknown based on the provided text
*   **UnixWare read/modify users' mail (/var/spool/mail):**
     *   **Weaknesses:** Improper access control to mail spool.
     *   **Impact:** Attackers could potentially read and modify user mail.
     *   **Attack vectors:** Direct access to `/var/spool/mail`.
     *   **Attacker Capabilities:** User needs to be able to access `/var/spool/mail`.
*   **UnixWare gain root with non-su/gid binaries:**
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Binary execution issues for non su/gid binaries.
    *    **Impact:** Attackers could use non-su/gid binaries to gain root privileges.
    *   **Attack vectors:** Executing vulnerable non-su/gid binaries.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Needs to be able to execute vulnerable binaries.
*   **UnixWare privileged process coredumps**
    *  **Weaknesses:** Issues with core dumping behavior of privileged processes.
    *   **Impact:** Possibly allows attackers to manipulate the core dump generation process, potentially revealing sensitive information or causing denial of service.
    *   **Attack vectors:** The attacker can manipulate the conditions that cause a core dump.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can manipulate the conditions that cause a core dump.
*    **UnixWare i2odialogd buffer overflow**
     *  **Weaknesses:** Buffer overflow in `i2odialogd`.
      * **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable process.
