# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-009 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Malformed Bind Request" Vulnerability

Published: March 16, 1999 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** March 16, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the LDAP Bind function for Exchange 5.5. The vulnerability could allow denial of service attacks against an Exchange server or, under certain conditions, could allow arbitrary code to be run on the server.

A fully supported patch is available, and Microsoft recommends that customers who are at risk from this attack download and install it.

**Issue**

The Bind function in the Exchange 5.5 Directory Service has an unchecked buffer that poses two threats to safe operation. The first is a denial of service threat. A malformed Bind request could overflow the buffer, causing the Exchange Directory service to crash. The server would not need to be rebooted, but the Exchange Directory service, and possibly dependent services as well, would need to be restarted in order to resume messaging service. The second threat is more esoteric and would be far more difficult to exploit. A carefully-constructed Bind request could cause arbitrary code to execute on the server via a classic buffer overrun technique. Neither attack could occur accidentally.

Customers who are using Exchange but who have turned off LDAP support in the Directory Service are not at risk from this vulnerability. Customers also can reduce their vulnerability to attacks from external sources by filtering incoming packets destined for TCP port 389, the LDAP service port.

Microsoft has no reports of any customers being affected by this vulnerability. However, Microsoft is proactively releasing a patch that corrects the problem.

* Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
