- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the LDAP Bind function of Exchange 5.5 Directory Service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the LDAP Bind function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of service: A malformed Bind request can cause the Exchange Directory service to crash, requiring a restart of the service and potentially dependent services.
    - Arbitrary code execution: A carefully crafted Bind request could allow arbitrary code execution on the server via a classic buffer overflow technique.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed LDAP Bind request to the Exchange server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the server on TCP port 389 (the LDAP service port).
