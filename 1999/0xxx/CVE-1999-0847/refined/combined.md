I should note that FICS development has been closed since 96.  I would
guess 1.7.something is the server version being used since I didn't
have this problem and I use 1.6.2 for my server.  From the work
I have done on the server, I have noticed there are many bugs in the
released sources for the server and talking about another bug is
more or less beating a dead horse.  Simply, if someone is going
to run a server, a lot of work must be done to get it stable.
