# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-037 - Critical

## Patch Available for "ImportExportFavorites" Vulnerability

Published: September 10, 1999 | Updated: December 08, 1999

**Version:** 1.3

**Originally Posted:** September 10, 1999

**Re-released:** September 24, 1999

**Revised:** December 08, 1999

**Summary**

On September 10, 1999, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin, in order to provide a workaround for a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 5 that could allow a malicious web site operator to take inappropriate action on the computer of a person who visited the site. Microsoft has completed a patch that completely eliminates the vulnerability, and has re-released this bulletin in order to advise customers of its availability. In addition to eliminating the "ImportExportFavorites" vulnerability, the patch also eliminates a security vulnerability posed by several ActiveX controls that ship as part of Internet Explorer 4.01 and 5.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-037.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-037)

**Issue**

IE 5 includes a feature that allows users to export a list of their favorite web sites to a file, or to import a file containing a list of favorite sites. The method that is used to perform this function, ImportExportFavorites(), should only allow particular types of files to be written, and only to specific locations on the drive. However, it is possible for a web site to invoke this method, bypass this restriction and write files that could be used to execute system commands. The net result is that a malicious web site operator potentially could take any action on the computer that the user would be capable of taking.

This vulnerability would chiefly affect workstations that are connected to the Internet. The patch restores correct operation to the ImportExportFavorites() method. In addition, the patch addresses security problems posed by several ActiveX controls. The specific controls and the actions taken are discussed in the FAQ.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 and 5

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0702](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0702)

**Patch Availability**

The patch is available at the following locations:

* [https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com](https://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/)
* [https:](https://)

  **NOTE:** On December 08, 1999, the patch for this vulnerability was replaced by one that eliminates both this error and the ["Server-Side Page Reference Redirect"](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms99-050) vulnerability.

  **NOTE:** This and other patches are available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21129)
