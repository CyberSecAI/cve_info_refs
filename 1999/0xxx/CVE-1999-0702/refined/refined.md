- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ImportExportFavorites()` method in Internet Explorer 5 allows a website to bypass file write restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper restriction of file types and locations when writing files via the `ImportExportFavorites()` method. Additionally, vulnerabilities in several ActiveX controls shipped with Internet Explorer 4.01 and 5 are also addressed by the patch.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious website can write files to arbitrary locations on the user's computer which can be used to execute system commands, potentially allowing the attacker to take any action on the computer that the user is capable of taking.
- **Attack vectors:** A user visits a malicious website which then invokes the vulnerable `ImportExportFavorites()` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a website that a user with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer will visit.
