- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer exists in the Windows NT Help utility.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the help utility when parsing malformed help files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the local machine.
- **Attack vectors**: A specially crafted, malformed help file is used to trigger the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to write a modified help file to a location where the help utility will access it, which is typically the `WINNT\help` folder by default. An attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable machine.
