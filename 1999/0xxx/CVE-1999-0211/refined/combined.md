CA-92:12                      CERT Advisory
                              May 28, 1992
         Revised Patch for SunOS /usr/etc/rpc.mountd Vulnerability

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 THIS ADVISORY AND CA-91:09 HAVE BEEN
                 SUPERSEDED BY CERT ADVISORY CA-94:02

The Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) has
received information concerning the availability of a revised security
patch for /usr/etc/rpc.mountd in Sun Microsystems Computer Corporation
operating systems.  This patch fixes an additional vulnerability that
was not addressed in CERT advisory CA-91:09.SunOS.rpc.mountd.vulnerability.

Sun has provided patches for SunOS 4.1, SunOS 4.1_PSR_A, SunOS 4.1.1,
and SunOS 4.1.2.  These patches are available through your local Sun
Answer Center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9)
in the /systems/sun/sun-dist directory.

Patch ID and file information are as follows:

Fix                     Patch ID       Filename            Checksum
/usr/etc/rpc.mountd     100296-02      100296-02.tar.Z     30606    23

Please note that Sun Microsystems sometimes updates patch files.  If you
find that the checksum is different, please contact Sun Microsystems or
the CERT/CC for verification.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I.   Description

     Under certain conditions an exported NFS filesystem can be
     mounted by any system on the Internet even though it may appear
     that access to the filesystem is restricted to specific hosts.

II.  Impact

     Unauthorized remote hosts will be able to mount the exported filesystem.

III. Solution

     As root:

     1.  Move the existing rpc.mountd aside and change the permissions.

         # mv /usr/etc/rpc.mountd /usr/etc/rpc.mountd.OLD
         # chmod 400 /usr/etc/rpc.mountd.OLD

     2.  Install the new version

         # cp `arch`/rpc.mountd /usr/etc
         # chown root.staff /usr/etc/rpc.mountd
         # chmod 755 /usr/etc/rpc.mountd

     3.  Kill the currently running rpc.mountd and restart it, or
         reboot the system.  In either case, systems with filesystems
         mounted from this host will have interruptions in service.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you believe that your system has been compromised, contact CERT/CC or
your representative in FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams).

> #### THIS IS A REVISED CERT ADVISORY IT CONTAINS NEW VULNERABILITY AND PATCH INFORMATION SUPERSEDES CERT ADVISORY CA-91.09 and CA-92.12

The CERT Coordination Center has received information concerning a
vulnerability in /usr/etc/rpc.mountd in Sun Microsystems, Inc. SunOS
4.1.1, 4.1.2, 4.1.3, and 4.1.3c. SunOS 4.1.3.u.1, Solaris 2.x, and
Solbourne's 4.1B and 4.1C are not vulnerable.

Sun has produced a patch for this vulnerability for sun3 and sun4
architectures. It is available through your local Sun Answer Center
as well as through anonymous FTP from the ftp.uu.net system in the
/systems/sun/sun-dist directory or from the ftp.eu.net system in the
/sun/fixes directory.

This vulnerability is currently being exploited. Please review
[CERT
Advisory CA-94.01 Ongoing Network Monitoring Attacks](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-94.01.ongoing.network.monitoring.attacks.html).

---

## I. Description

If an access list of hosts within /etc/exports is a string
over 256 characters or if the cached list of netgroups exceeds
the cache capacity then the file system can be mounted by anyone.
## II. Impact

Unauthorized remote hosts will be able to mount the file system.
This will allow unauthorized users read and write access to files
on mounted file systems.
## III. Solution

Obtain and install the appropriate patch following the instructions
included with the patch.

Patches are available from

ftp://ftp.uu.net/systems/sun/sun-dist/patches/

ftp://ftp.eu.net/sun/fixes/

There is a README file and directory layout to help identify which
binaries are appropriate for which architectures.
```

```

Sept. 19,1997  Attached copyright statement
Aug. 30, 1996  Information previously in the README was inserted
               into the advisory. Updated URL format.
June 09, 1995  Solution - recommended source to use for patches if the
               checksums didn't match
Apr. 20, 1994  Solution - noted that Sun ensured that the same versions of
               patches were available at all locations and provided files to
               help determine which architectures require the patch.
