# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-055 - Important

## Patch Available for "Malformed Resource Enumeration Argument" Vulnerability

Published: December 09, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** December 09, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ®. The vulnerability could cause a Windows NT machine to stop responding to requests for services.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-055.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-055).

**Issue**

When a specific type of malformed argument is supplied to a resource enumeration request, the Windows NT Service Control Manager can fail. The primary effect of the failure is to cause named pipes to fail, which prevents many other system services from operating. The failure would not cause the machine to crash, and as a result it might not be obvious to the operator that the machine was no longer in service. An affected computer can be put back into service by rebooting.

The resource enumeration request involved in the vulnerability must be made via IPC, so customers can protect against remote attacks by blocking NetBios requests at the firewall. Networks that allow anonymous logons can prevent attacks by disabling the ability for null sessions to submit enumeration requests; this can be done using the RestictAnonymous registry key. Both of these measures are good security practices in any case.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
