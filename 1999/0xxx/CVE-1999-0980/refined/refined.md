- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A malformed argument supplied to a resource enumeration request can cause the Windows NT Service Control Manager to fail.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way Windows NT Service Control Manager handles malformed resource enumeration arguments. This can lead to the failure of named pipes, preventing many other system services from operating.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The primary effect of the vulnerability is to cause named pipes to fail, preventing many other system services from operating. The machine does not crash, but its services become unavailable, effectively rendering the computer unusable until rebooted.
- **Attack vectors**: The resource enumeration request must be made via IPC (Inter-Process Communication). This means the attack must originate from a local process or over a network connection using protocols that support IPC.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed resource enumeration request via IPC to the targeted Windows NT machine. 
    - For remote attacks, NetBIOS requests need to be allowed through firewalls. Also, if anonymous logons are enabled, the ability to submit enumeration requests via null sessions needs to be available.
