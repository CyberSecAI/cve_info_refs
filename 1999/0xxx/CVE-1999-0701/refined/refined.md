- **Root cause of vulnerability**: During unattended installations of Windows NT 4.0, the installation parameters file (Unattend.txt) is copied to a file in %windir%\system32 (either $winnt$.inf or $nt4pre$.inf depending on the installation method), but this copy is not deleted after installation completes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the fact that the copied installation parameters file, which may contain sensitive information such as account passwords, is left on the hard drive with default read permissions for any interactive user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can gain access to sensitive information, including local administrator passwords, by reading the residual installation parameters file. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system and compromise of user accounts.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local file system access to the residual installation parameter file located in the %windir%\system32 directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have the ability to perform an interactive logon to the system in order to access and read the vulnerable file.
