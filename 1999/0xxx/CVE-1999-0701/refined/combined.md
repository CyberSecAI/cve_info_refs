# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-036 - Critical

## Windows NT 4.0 Does Not Delete Unattended Installation File

Published: September 10, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** September 10, 1999

**Summary**

When an unattended installation of MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® 4.0 completes, a copy of the file that contains installation parameters remains on the hard drive. Depending on the method that was used to perform the installation and the specific installation parameters that were selected, the file could contain sensitive information, potentially including the local Administrator password.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-036.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-036)

**Issue**

When an unattended installation of Windows NT 4.0 is performed, the installation parameters are included in a file named Unattend.txt. A vulnerability exists because the installation process copies the parameter file to a file in %windir%\system32 ($winnt$.inf for a normal unattended installation, or $nt4pre$.inf if Sysprep was used) but does not delete it when the installation completes. By default, this file can be read by any user who can perform an interactive logon. If sensitive information such as account passwords were provided in the installation parameters file, the information could be compromised.

As discussed in the FAQ, the degree of risk from this vulnerability varies depending on the particular installation. However, in general, workstations and terminal servers deployed using the Sysprep tool would be at greatest risk from it.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0701](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0701)

**Resolution**

Customers performing unattended installations of Windows NT 4.0 should ensure that they either review the file and erase any sensitive information such as account information and passwords, or delete the file altogether.
