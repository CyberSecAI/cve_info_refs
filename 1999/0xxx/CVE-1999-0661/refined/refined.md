**Summary:**
This is a case of trojaned OpenSSH distribution files, not a vulnerability in the software itself. The OpenSSH versions 3.2.2p1, 3.4p1 and 3.4 were compromised on the OpenBSD FTP server. The malicious code was added to the source code and would execute when the software was built.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A malicious actor gained access to the OpenBSD FTP server and modified the OpenSSH source code. The modified source code included a backdoor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Compromised distribution channel:** The OpenBSD FTP server, a trusted source for OpenSSH, was compromised. This is a supply chain attack.
- **Backdoor in source code:** The trojaned `bf-test.c` file contained malicious code designed to establish a remote connection and execute commands. The file was disguised as a compatibility test for HP-UX PL.2 systems, which was a lie.
- **Modified build process:** The `Makefile.in` file was modified to compile and execute the trojan.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** The trojan established a connection to a remote server. Upon receiving a specific command from the remote server, the trojan would execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system with the privileges of the user who compiled the software.
- **System compromise:** An attacker could gain full control of a system through the backdoor.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Compromised software distribution:** Users downloaded the trojaned OpenSSH versions from the compromised OpenBSD FTP server and its mirrors.
- **Build process exploitation:** The trojan was activated during the software compilation process, affecting users who compiled the software from the malicious sources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to OpenBSD FTP server:** The attacker needed to gain write access to the OpenBSD FTP server to modify the source code.
- **Knowledge of the OpenSSH build process:** The attacker needed to understand the build process to modify the `Makefile.in` and insert their malicious code in `bf-test.c` file effectively.
- **Remote server:** The attacker needed a server listening on port 6667 at 203.62.158.32 to connect to.

**Technical details:**
- The trojan was added to `openbsd-compat/bf-test.c` and `openbsd-compat/Makefile.in` files.
- The `bf-test.c` file was modified to include a backdoor that establishes a connection to a remote server on port 6667.
- The backdoor can be remotely instructed to:
    -  Terminate the exploit.
    - Execute arbitrary shell commands.
    -  Go to sleep and retry later.
- The `Makefile.in` file was modified to compile and run the trojan during the build process.
- The trojan attempts to connect to 203.62.158.32:6667 once per hour.
- The trojan attempts to execute `/bin/sh` when instructed by the attacker.
