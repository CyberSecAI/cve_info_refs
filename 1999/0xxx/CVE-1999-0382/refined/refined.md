- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because Windows NT fails to verify if the security context change from the local system context to the user's context was successful when launching a screen saver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of validation after the security context switch for the screen saver process. This allows a screen saver to potentially continue running with elevated privileges if the context switch fails.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could craft a screen saver program that exploits this vulnerability to gain administrative privileges on the local machine. This allows the attacker to add themselves to the local Administrators group or, in the case of a domain controller, gain domain administrator privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious screen saver program that prevents the security context from switching properly.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to run code on the target machine, such as being a non-administrative user with the ability to set a custom screen saver. The attacker needs the ability to have code executed on a target system, commonly by setting a custom screensaver.
