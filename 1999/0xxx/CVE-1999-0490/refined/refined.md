- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the processing of the `IMG SRC` tag in HTML files within Internet Explorer. The tag can be used to point to files of any type, rather than only image files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability allows a malicious website operator to use the document object model (DOM) to determine information about files on the user's computer, such as their size and MIME type.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gather information about files on a user's computer. While they cannot read or change the file content, the attacker can discover file existence, size and MIME types. The attacker needs to know the name of each file to query for the information.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is a malicious website that leverages a crafted `IMG SRC` tag.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to host a website accessible to the target user, and be able to inject the malicious `IMG SRC` tag.
