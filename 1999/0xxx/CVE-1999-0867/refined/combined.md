# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-029 - Important

## Patch Available for "Malformed HTTP Request Header" Vulnerability

Published: August 11, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** August 11, 1999

**Re-released:** August 16, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in web server products that use MicrosoftÂ® Internet Information Server 4.0 as their web engine. The vulnerability could be used to mount denial of service attacks against the web server. This patch originally was released on August 11, 1999, but was found to contain a regression error. The regression error has been eliminated and the new patch is now available.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-029.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-029)

**Issue**

If multiple HTTP requests containing specially-malformed headers are sent to an affected server, IIS may consume all memory on the server. If this happens, IIS would be unable to service requests until either the clients that issued the requests were closed, or the IIS service were stopped and restarted. Once either of these actions have occurred, normal service would be restored.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0

  **Note**   Although the vulnerability lies in IIS 4.0, several other Microsoft products also are affected because they use IIS 4.0 as their web engine. The patch can be applied to these products as well:
* Microsoft Site Server 3.0
* Microsoft Site Server 3.0, Commerce Edition
* Microsoft Commerce Internet System 2.0 and 2.5

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0867](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0867)
