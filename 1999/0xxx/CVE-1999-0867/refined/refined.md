- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 handles specially malformed HTTP request headers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is caused by the improper parsing of HTTP headers. Sending multiple requests with these malformed headers can cause the server to allocate memory until it consumes all available resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, where the server becomes unresponsive and unable to handle requests until the problematic client connections are closed or the IIS service is restarted.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited remotely by sending HTTP requests with specially crafted malformed headers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No special privileges are required.
