# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-001 - Critical

## Patch Available for exposure in Forms 2.0 TextBox Control that allows data to be read from user's Clipboard

Published: January 21, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** January 21, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that fixes a vulnerability in the Forms 2.0 ActiveX control. This control is distributed in any application that includes Visual Basic for Applications 5.0. A malicious hacker could use the Forms 2.0 Control to read or export text on a user's Clipboard when that user visits a web site set up by the malicious hacker or opens a HTML email created by the malicious hacker.

A fully supported patch is available to fix this vulnerability, and Microsoft recommends that customers download and install it to protect their computers.

**Issue**

The Forms 2.0 ActiveX control has a vulnerability that allows text to be pasted from a user's Clipboard into a Forms 2.0 Text Box or Combo Box. This control is installed as a standard part of the applications listed in the "Affected Products" section below.

A malicious hacker could use the Forms 2.0 Control to read or export text on a user's Clipboard when that user visits a web site set up by the malicious hacker or opens a HTML email created by the malicious hacker.

The Forms 2.0 Security Patch prevents a hacker from exploiting this vulnerability. Those who install the patch will not lose functionality and will still have the ability to manually paste content from their Clipboard to a Forms 2.0 Text Box or Combo Box. Developers who have built VBA solutions using the Forms 2.0 Control will still be able to paste into Text Boxes and Combo Boxes.

While there have not been any reports of customers being adversely affected by these problems, Microsoft is releasing a patch to address any risks posed by this issue.

**Affected Software Versions**

The following software installs the Forms 2.0 control:

* Microsoft Office 97
* Microsoft Outlook 98
* Microsoft Project 98
* Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0
* Any third-party product that includes Visual Basic for Applications 5.0

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0384](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0384)

To determine whether you need to download and install the security fix, right-click the Fm20.dll file in your \Windows\System folder and choose Properties on the shortcut menu. If the file date of your FM20.dll file is earlier than January 11, 1999 (1/11/99), you should download and install the security fix.
