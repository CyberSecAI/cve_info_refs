- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in the Forms 2.0 ActiveX control that allows text to be pasted from a user's clipboard into a Forms 2.0 Text Box or Combo Box without proper authorization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper clipboard access control in the Forms 2.0 ActiveX control.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious hacker could exploit this vulnerability to read or export text from a user's clipboard without the user's knowledge or consent. This could potentially expose sensitive information stored on the clipboard.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a malicious hacker through a web site or HTML email. A user who visits the malicious website or opens the malicious HTML email is vulnerable to having their clipboard data accessed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious web page or HTML email that uses the vulnerable Forms 2.0 ActiveX control. The attacker needs to entice the victim to either visit the web page or open the email.
