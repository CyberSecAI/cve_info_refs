- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability in the implementation of cross-frame security in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability allows a malicious website operator to circumvent certain Internet Explorer security safeguards, enabling them to potentially read the contents of files on a user's computer. Specifically, a cross-frame navigation issue exists where the normal security restrictions between frames of different origins are not properly enforced.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious website could read local files on the computer of a user browsing it through Internet Explorer.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a malicious website that exploits the cross-frame security vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to operate a malicious website that a user visits with a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer. No specific user interaction beyond visiting the malicious website is specified in the document.
