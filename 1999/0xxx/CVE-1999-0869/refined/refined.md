- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Internet Explorer's cross-domain protection does not extend to navigation of frames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper cross-domain protection for frame navigation, allowing a malicious website to insert content into a frame within another website's window.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious website can impersonate a window on a legitimate website, potentially tricking users into providing personal information. The attacker can collect the information entered by the user in the spoofed frame and send it to the malicious site. Both HTTP and HTTPS sites are vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious website can insert content into a frame within another website's window.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and use it to inject content into a frame of another website.
