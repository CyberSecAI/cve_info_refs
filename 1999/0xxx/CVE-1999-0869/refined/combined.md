# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS98-020 - Critical

## Patch Available for 'Frame Spoof' Vulnerability

Published: December 23, 1998 | Updated: May 16, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Originally Posted:** December 23, 1998

**Updated:** May 16, 2003

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that fixes a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet ExplorerÂ® that could allow a malicious web site operator to impersonate a window on a legitimate web site. The threat posed by this vulnerability is that the bogus window could collect information from the user and send it back to the malicious site.

A fully supported patch is available for this vulnerability, and Microsoft recommends that all customers download and install it to protect their computers.

**Issue**

This vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer's cross domain protection does not extend to navigation of frames. This makes it possible for a malicious web site to insert content into a frame within another web site's window. If done properly, the user might not be able to tell that the frame

contents were not from the legitimate site, and could be tricked into providing personal data to the malicious site. Non-secure (HTTP) and secure (HTTPS) sites are equally at risk from this vulnerability.

While there have not been any reports of customers being adversely affected by these problems, Microsoft is releasing a patch to address any risks posed by this issue.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.X, 4.0, 4.01, 4.01 Service
* Pack 1 for Windows 95
* Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.01 Service Pack 1 for Windows 98
* Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.X, 4.0, 4.01, 4.01 Service
* Pack 1 for Windows NT 4.0
* Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.X, 4.0, 4.01 for Windows 3.1
* Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.X, 4.0, 4.01 for Windows NT 3.51
* Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.X, 4.X for Macintosh
* Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4 for UNIX on HPUX
* Microsoft Internet Explorer version 4 for UNIX on Sun Solaris
* No other products or versions of Internet Explorer are affected
