- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way the TCP/IP stack implementations of Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0 handle fragmented IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of fragmented IGMP packets, leading to potential disruption of normal system operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sending fragmented IGMP packets to a vulnerable Windows system can result in a range of issues. For Windows 95 and 98, this can range from slow performance to system crashes. While Windows NT 4.0 is also vulnerable, other system mechanisms mitigate the impact, making successful attacks more difficult.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending specially crafted, fragmented IGMP packets to the targeted machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the targeted machines. No specific position is mentioned, but the attacker would need to be on the same network or have network access to the targeted machines.
