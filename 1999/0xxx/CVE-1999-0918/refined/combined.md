Published: September 03, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Revised:** September 09, 1999

**Originally Posted:** September 03, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the TCP/IP stack implementations of MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 95, Windows 98Â® and Windows NTÂ® 4.0. Fragmented IGMP packets can cause a variety of problems in Windows 95 and 98, up to and including causing the machine to crash. Windows NT 4.0 contains the same vulnerability, but other system mechanisms make a successful attack much more difficult.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-034.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-034)

**Issue**

By sending fragmented IGMP packets to a Windows 95, 98 or Windows NT 4.0 machine, it is possible to disrupt the normal operation of the machine. This vulnerability primarily affects Windows 95 and 98 machines. Depending on a variety of factors, sending such packets to a Windows 95 or 98 machine may elicit behavior ranging from slow performance to crashing.

Windows NT contains the same vulnerability, but other system mechanisms compensate and make it much more difficult to mount a successful attack.
