Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Webcom CGI Guestbook programs (`wguest.exe` and `rguest.exe`) improperly handling the `template` parameter. Instead of using it for intended template functionality, the programs directly use the supplied path to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Read:** The programs allow an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path via the `template` parameter, resulting in the server disclosing the contents of that file.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The CGI scripts do not validate or sanitize the input provided in the `template` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to access sensitive files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read any text-based file on the server's file system that the web server's user (e.g., IUSR_MACHINENAME on IIS) has read access to. This can expose sensitive configuration files (like `boot.ini`, `$winnt$.inf`), application code, and other potentially private information.
- **System Compromise:** In some cases the revealed information could be used to further compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable CGI programs, specifically:
  - `http://server/cgi-bin/wguest.exe?template=c:\boot.ini`
  - `http://server/cgi-bin/rguest.exe?template=c:\winnt\system32\$winnt$.inf`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the paths of files on the server they wish to access.
- **Web Server User Permissions:** The web server's user (e.g., IUSR_MACHINENAME on IIS) must have read access to the files the attacker is trying to access through NTFS permissions. On systems like Windows 95/98 which lack file level security, every file is potentially readable.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in both `wguest.exe` (used for writing to the guestbook) and `rguest.exe` (used for reading from the guestbook).
- The latest version of the software at the time of the report was still vulnerable.
- The reporter attempted to notify the vendor but did not receive a response.
