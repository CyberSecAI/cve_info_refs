- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The client software for Microsoft RAS or RRAS caches user credentials (including passwords) regardless of whether the "Save password" option is selected or not.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of the "Save password" option in RAS and RRAS clients, leading to unintended caching of credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of user passwords, potentially allowing unauthorized access to remote servers if the cached credentials are compromised. The credentials are encrypted and protected by ACLs, and SYSKEY feature can provide strong encryption of the password data in Windows NT 4.0 SP4.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to the local machine could potentially gain access to the cached credentials from the registry.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the affected Windows NT machine is required.
