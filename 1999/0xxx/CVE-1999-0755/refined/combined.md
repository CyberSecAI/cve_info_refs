# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-017 - Important

## Patch Available for "RAS and RRAS Password" Vulnerability

Published: May 27, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** May 27, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® Remote Access Service (RAS) and Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) clients, in which a user's password is cached even if the user de-selects the ";Save password"; option.

**Issue**

When the client software for Microsoft RAS or RRAS is used to dial into a server, a dialogue requests the user's userid and password for the server. On the same dialogue is a checkbox whose caption reads ";Save password"; and which is intended to provide the user with the option to cache their security credentials if desired. However, the implemented client functionality actually caches the user's credentials regardless of whether the checkbox is selected or de-selected.

Cached security credentials, which include the password, are stored and encrypted in the registry and protected by ACLs whose default values authorize only local administrators and the owner of the credentials to access them. Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 also provides the ability to strongly encrypts the password data stored in the registry using the SYSKEY feature.

While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by this vulnerability, Microsoft is proactively releasing a patch that restores correct functionality to the password caching function. The patch should be applied to all machines that are used as RAS or RRAS clients. It is important to note that RRAS servers also can be used as RAS clients, and any machines used in such a capacity should have the patch applied as well.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
