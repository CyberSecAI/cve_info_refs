- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that a website hosting the "safe for scripting" version of the DHTML Edit control can upload any data entered into the control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - A "safe for scripting" version of the DHTML Edit ActiveX control allows websites to upload data entered into the control, even if the data is sensitive.
    - The control allows loading local files programmatically if the filename is known.
    - Lack of domain restriction on data upload from the control.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - A malicious website operator can trick a user into entering sensitive data into the DHTML Edit control, then upload it to the attacker's server.
    - A malicious website operator can programmatically load local files from the user's hard drive into the control (if the filename is known) and then upload it to the attacker's server.
    - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive user data and local files.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious website can host the vulnerable ActiveX control and trick the user to interact with it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to host a web page with the vulnerable ActiveX control.
    - The attacker needs to be able to trick the user into entering data into the control.
    - The attacker needs to know the exact name of the file to load from the user's local drive (for the local file access vulnerability)
