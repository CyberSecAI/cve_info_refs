# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-005 - Important

## BackOffice Server 4.0 Does Not Delete Installation Setup File

Published: February 12, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** February 12, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has learned of a potential vulnerability in the installer for BackOffice Server 4.0. The installer asks the user to provide the account userid and password for selected services and writes these to a file in order to automate the installation process. However, the file is not deleted when the installation process completes. As detailed below, Microsoft recommends that BackOffice 4.0 customers delete this file.

Microsoft has received no reports of customers being adversely affected by this problem. However, it is releasing this security bulletin in order to proactively provide customers with information about the problem in order to allow them to take steps to ensure their safe computing.

**Issue**

When a user chooses to install SQL Server, Exchange Server or Microsoft Transaction Server as part of a BackOffice 4.0 installation, the BackOffice installer program requests the name and password for the accounts associated with these services. Specifically, it asks for the account name and password for the SQL Executive Logon account, the Exchange Services Account, and the MTS Remote Administration Account. These values are stored in <systemdrive>\Program Files\Microsoft Backoffice\Reboot.ini, and used to install the associated services.

BackOffice Server does not erase this file when the installation process is completed. This is true regardless of whether the installation process completes successfully or unsuccessfully. By default, the Microsoft BackOffice folder is not shared, so network access to reboot.ini generally does not pose a risk. Users who can log onto the server locally would be able to access the file, but in most cases this ability is granted only to selected users such as administrators.

The fix for this problem is to delete the file <systemdrive>\Program Files\Microsoft Backoffice\Reboot.ini after each BackOffice 4.0 installation, whether successful or not. The file is created only by the installer, and, once deleted, will not be re-created unless BackOffice 4.0 is re-installed.

**Affected Software Versions**

The following software versions are affected:

* Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.0

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0372](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0372)
