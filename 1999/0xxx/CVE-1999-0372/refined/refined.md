- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The BackOffice Server 4.0 installer does not delete the `Reboot.ini` file after installation. This file contains the account user ID and passwords for selected services (SQL Executive Logon, Exchange Services Account, and MTS Remote Administration Account).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installer saves sensitive account credentials in a file that is not deleted post-installation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local users with access to the server can read the `Reboot.ini` file and obtain stored credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to the mentioned services.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the server's file system is required to read the file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the server where BackOffice Server 4.0 is installed.
