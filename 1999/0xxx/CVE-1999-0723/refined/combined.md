# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-021 - Important

## Patch Available for "CSRSS Worker Thread Exhaustion" Vulnerability

Published: June 23, 1999 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** June 23, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® CSRSS process that could be used to create a denial of service condition against a machine that allows interactive logons.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-021.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-021)

**Issue**

If all worker threads in CSRSS.EXE are occupied awaiting user input, no other requests can be serviced, effectively causing the server to hang. When user input is provided, processing returns to normal. The patch eliminates the vulnerability by ensuring that the last CSRSS worker thread services only requests that do not require user input.

* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server
