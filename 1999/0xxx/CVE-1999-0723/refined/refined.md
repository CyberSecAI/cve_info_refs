- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the way CSRSS.EXE handles worker threads. If all worker threads are occupied awaiting user input, the server becomes unresponsive as no other requests can be serviced.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A lack of proper resource management in the CSRSS process. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the fact that all worker threads can potentially be consumed by user input requests, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the server to hang and become unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by making requests to the CSRSS process that require user input, exhausting all available worker threads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate requests that consume CSRSS worker threads, which, according to the document, means the machine must allow interactive logons.
