# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-050 - Important

## Patch Available for "Server-side Page Reference Redirect" Vulnerability

Published: December 08, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** December 08, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer 4.01, 5 and 5.01, that could allow a malicious web site operator to view a file on the computer of a visiting user, provided that the web site operator knew the name and folder of the file.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-050.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-050).

**Issue**

When a web server performs a server-side redirect, the IE security model checks the server's permissions on the new page. However, under favorable timing conditions, it is possible for a web server to create a reference to a client window that the server is permitted to view, then use a server-side redirect to a client-local file, and bypass the security restrictions. The result is that it could be possible for a malicious web site operator to view files on the computer of a visiting user. The web site operator would need to know (or guess) the name and location of the file.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0981](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0981)

**Patch Availability**

* [https:](https://)
  **NOTE:**   This patch also includes the previously-released patch for the ["ImportExportFavorites"](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms99-037) vulnerability.

  **NOTE:**   Microsoft produces security patches for Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2 and higher. In the event that this package is applied to Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1, the package states that a fix is not needed.
