- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from how Internet Explorer handles server-side redirects in conjunction with client-side window references. Specifically, under certain timing conditions, a malicious web server can create a reference to a client window the server is allowed to access. Then, the server uses a server-side redirect to a client-local file, bypassing security restrictions that should prevent accessing local files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of server-side redirects and client window references by Internet Explorer's security model.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a malicious web site operator to view files on the computer of a user visiting their website, provided the attacker knows or can guess the file's name and location.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious website that leverages server-side redirects to access local files on a user's machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to operate a malicious web server and know (or guess) the name and location of a file on the victim's computer. The attacker also relies on specific timing conditions during the redirect process.
