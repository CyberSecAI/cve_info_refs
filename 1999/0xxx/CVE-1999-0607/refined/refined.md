The provided content describes a vulnerability related to insecure storage of customer data by various shopping cart applications, which is a different issue than the one described in CVE-1999-0607.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Various commercial and freeware shopping cart applications create world-readable files containing sensitive customer information within the web server's document tree.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Insecure file storage: Customer data, including names, credit card numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and order details, are stored in plain text in world-readable files.
*   Lack of access control: These sensitive files are placed within the web server's document tree, making them accessible to anyone.
*   Failure to remove or restrict access to files containing sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Exposure of sensitive customer data: Attackers can access and steal customer information, including credit card numbers.
*   Potential for financial fraud: Stolen credit card information can be used for fraudulent purchases.
*   Privacy violations: Exposure of personal information can lead to privacy breaches and identity theft.
*   Reputational damage: Affected businesses can suffer reputational damage.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Search engine indexing: Vulnerable files are indexed by search engines, allowing attackers to find them easily.
*   Direct file access: Attackers can access the files directly through the web server if they know the file names and locations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Basic knowledge of search engine techniques to discover the vulnerable files.
*   Ability to access the files via the web server.
*   No special privileges needed. The vulnerability is due to the web servers configuration and the application's insecure storage of information.
