- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CiscoSecure Access Control Server (ACS) for UNIX versions 1.0 through 2.3.2 has a database access protocol that does not require authentication for remote users to read and write to the server database.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of authentication for the database access protocol on TCP port 9900. This allows unauthorized remote users to directly interact with the server database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read and write to the CiscoSecure ACS database. Depending on the network environment, this can allow unauthorized modification of access policies enforced by the CiscoSecure ACS.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote attackers can connect to TCP port 9900 on the vulnerable CiscoSecure ACS server using a utility that is capable of using the vulnerable database access protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers must be able to establish a TCP connection to port 9900 on the vulnerable CiscoSecure ACS server.
