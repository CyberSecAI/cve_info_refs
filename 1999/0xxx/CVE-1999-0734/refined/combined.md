| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCiscoSecure Access Control Server for UNIX Remote Administration Vulnerability Severity   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-19990819-dbaccess  First Published: 1999 August 19 15:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)            Email      Summary  * In CiscoSecure Access Control Server (CiscoSecure ACS) for UNIX,   versions 1.0 through 2.3.2, there is a database access protocol that could   permit unauthorized remote users to read and write the server database without   authentication. Depending on the network environment, this might permit   unauthorized users to modify the access policies enforced by the CiscoSecure   ACS. A utility that is capable of using this protocol to read or modify a   database is shipped with the CiscoSecure ACS product.  This vulnerability can be eliminated by either a CiscoSecure   configuration change, or network configuration change. Cisco has provided a new   release that changed a default setting, in order to ensure higher default   security level.  This vulnerability has Cisco bug ID CSCdm71489.  This advisory is posted at   <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-19990819-dbaccess>.  Affected Products  * This section provides details on affected products.    Vulnerable Products If you are running an affected version of CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX, and   if you have not modified the configuration to strictly permit connections from   trusted hosts, and if untrusted users can make TCP connections to TCP port 9900   on the computer on which you have installed CiscoSecure ACS, then you are   vulnerable. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Users of CiscoSecure ACS for Windows NT are *not*   vulnerable.  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these   vulnerabilities.  Details  * This vulnerability has been assigned Cisco bug ID CSCdm71489.  Workarounds  * Two workarounds for this vulnerability exist.  One workaround consists of enabling client validation within   CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX. A caveat to this workaround is that there are some   versions of CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX that are subject to another defect, which   prevents access to additional administration utilities (the Advanced   Administration GUI) within CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX when the client validation   feature is enabled. This problem is identified in CSCdm72555 which affects   versions 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, and CSCdk55423, which affects versions 2.2.2, 2.2.3   of CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX. This workaround will not be effective in   CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX version 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.3.1 and 2.3.2, and customers   are encouraged to upgrade to a version that does not include this defect.   Version 2.3.3 is currently available and is not susceptible to the above   problem.  You must edit the CSCconfig.ini file, list the permitted remote access   hosts, enable remote client validation. TACACS or RADIUS clients do NOT need to   be listed under this setting, only hosts that are permitted to administer the   server should be listed.  In the following example, 'acs\_srv\_machine' resolves to localhost, and   we are providing remote administration privileges to the hosts 'client\_machine'   and the ip address 172.16.23.23. Permitted clients may be defined by a   hostname, or an ip address.  CSCconfig.ini file should be edited with the following information:  ```   [ValidClients]       ;if ValidateClients=true, than we only allow the clients with ids listed       ; to connect to the dbserver       100 = acs_srv_machine       100 = client_machine       100 = 172.16.23.23       ValidateClients = true       ...   ```  An additional configuration parameter "FastAdminValidClients" was   added in CiscoSecure ACS version 2.3.3 allowing the Fast Administrator Web   based GUI to permit the same IP addresses specified in the valid clients list,   to further restrict client access.  A second workaround is to use filtering on other network devices, such   as a firewall, to control or block access to TCP port 9900 on the CiscoSecure   ACS for UNIX server.  Fixed Software  * This applies ONLY to CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX, and is present in all   versions, up to version 2.3.2. Version 2.3.3 of CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX has   been modified to validate administrative clients by default.  This vulnerability applies only to the software product CiscoSecure   Access Control Server for UNIX, and does not apply to CiscoSecure Access   Control Server for NT.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * Cisco does not have any reports of malicious use of this vulnerability.   CiscoSecure ACS for UNIX Reference Guide does include a cautionary note   regarding this vulnerability.
