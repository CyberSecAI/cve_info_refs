NOTICE
Due to confusion over the meaning of our "CREDITS" section in our
advisories, we would like to clarify the matter of Perry Metzger and
his support for OpenBSD. At this time we would like to make it clear
that these comments were meant in jest, as a reaction to a large body
of public commentary by Mr. Metzger regarding OpenBSD. As far as we
know, Mr. Metzger in no way supports the OpenBSD project.

OpenBSD Security Advisory
February 15, 1998
IP Source Routing Problem
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNOPSIS
Due to implementation problems, the system configuration control for "do
source route" does not prevent source routed packets from being accepted
by 4.4BSD kernels. Additionally, if source routing is enabled, the
"forward IP packets" control does not prevent source routed packets from
being forwarded.
This allows remote attackers to trivially spoof TCP connections against
BSD hosts on networks that do not filter source routed packets via router
packet filters.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
AFFECTED SYSTEMS
This vulnerability has been confirmed against OpenBSD 2.2 (and below), and
FreeBSD 2.2.5 (and below). Also FreeBSD 2.2-current (before 1998/02/16)
and FreeBSD-stable (before 1998/02/23) are vulnerable.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETAILS
4.4BSD allows "kernel state" variables, which control certain
configuration options inside the kernel, to be changed via the "sysctl"
facility. "sysctl" is used to define whether a 4.4BSD system accepts
source routed packets, via the variable "net.inet.ip.dosourceroute".
This variable is set to "0" by default, meaning "do not perform IP source
routing".
Additionally, the sysctl variable "net.inet.ip.forwarding" dictates
whether the system will act as an IP router, forwarding any received
packets that are not destined to the host. This variable is also turned
off by default.
Due to the manner in which the check against the "dosourceroute" variable
is implemented in the kernel, it is possible to send source routed packets
to a 4.4BSD host, even when the flag is set to "0". The "dosourceroute"
flag only prevents forwarding of source routed packets, not delivery to
the local system.
Source routed packets can be used to spoof TCP connections that appear to
come from arbitrary hosts. A host receiving a source-routed packet sends
replies to that packet using the reverse of the specified route; an
attacker can route TCP message responses (such as the server SYN+ACK of
the TCP three-way-handshake) back to her machine, to obtain the server's
initial sequence number and complete a TCP active open.
Additionally, the "forwarding" variable does not apply to the forwarding
of source routed packets. If source routing is enabled, source routed
packets will be forwarded regardless of whether the "forwarding" variable
is set.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TECHNICAL DETAILS
These problems exist due to the manner in which the kernel state variables
"dosourceroute" and "forwarding" are checked inside the kernel IP input
processing code. Both problems are the result of code within the kernel
function "ip\_dooptions()", which processes IP options in incoming
datagrams.
The IP source routing check in 4.4BSD is performed only after a packet is
checked to see if it is at the end of it's source route, in which case the
packet is delivered if it is destined to the processing host. The
destination of a source routed packet will usually be the end of a source
route; hence, this check will almost always result in the delivery of the
source routed packet.
IP packets can be "forwarded", via the "ip\_forward()" function, in two
places in the IP input processing code. The first place IP packets are
forwarded at is the initial IP input processing function "ip\_input()",
which handles the general case of forwarding arbitrary packets. This code
checks the variable "forwarding" to verify that the system is configured
to forward IP packets.
IP packets can also be forwarded in the "ip\_dooptions()" function, in the
case of source routed packets. This can only occur if the "dosourceroute"
variable is enabled; however, the "forwarding" variable is not checked
from within "ip\_dooptions()", meaning that a system configured to allow
source routing will forward source routed packets even with IP forwarding
disabled.
Additionally, if IP forwarding is enabled, and IP source routing is
disabled, source routed packets can be forwarded as long as the recipient
isn't listed in the source route.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESOLUTION
This is a kernel problem that can only be fixed by patching or upgrading
the problematic system code. Patches for the OpenBSD and FreeBSD operating
systems are provided in this advisory. This problem is fixed in
OpenBSD-current and must be patched in versions 2.2 and below. The
attached FreeBSD patch is against version 2.2.5.
The attached OpenBSD patch modifies the kernel to check the
"dosourceroute" variable immediately upon detecting a source-route option
in a recieved IP packet. If source routing is disabled, the packet will be
logged and dropped before any further processing is performed.
Additionally, the variable "forwarding" is now checked from within the
"ip\_dooptions()" function, meaning that source routed packets can only be
forwarded when IP forwarding is enabled.
The attached FreeBSD patch adds a new sysctl kernel variable,
"accept\_sourceroute", which determines whether the OS will deliver
source routed packets locally if they have the source route option set.
Additionally, source routed packets are dropped automatically if
"dosourceroute" is set to zero, and the "ip\_forwarding" variable is
checked before packets are forwarded from ip\_dooptions(), preventing
source routed packets from being forwarded when IP forwarding is disabled.
More information about the OpenBSD resolution to the problem is available
at "http://www.openbsd.org/errata.html#sourceroute".
Sites that cannot patch their kernels (or run operating systems without
available patches) can address this problem by packet filtering source
routed packets at routers or via kernel packet filters such as IP-filter.

CREDITS
Documentation and testing of this problem was conducted by Theo de Raadt
and the OpenBSD development team with the assistance of Secure Networks
Inc. Helpful information and FreeBSD's response to this problem were
provided by Guido van Rooij.
The developers of OpenBSD and the author of this advisory would like
to again confirm the fact that Perry Metzger does not in any way support
their project.
