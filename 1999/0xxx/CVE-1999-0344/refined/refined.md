- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The server-side component of `DebugActiveProcess` does not correctly check for valid access to the target process, allowing a non-administrative user to gain debug-level access on a system process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insufficient access control in the `DebugActiveProcess` function.
    - Ability for a non-administrative user to gain debug-level access to system processes.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Privilege elevation: Non-administrative user can gain local administrative privileges.
    - Arbitrary code execution in the system security context.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access required: The attacker must have a valid local account on the system and be able to run arbitrary code.
    - Exploitation through a program (`sechole.exe`) that modifies memory and attaches to system processes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - A local account on the vulnerable Windows NT system.
    - Ability to execute arbitrary code on the system.
    - Physical access to the computer in order to logon locally.
