- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Shopping cart applications, when installed incorrectly or by inexperienced users, create world-readable files containing sensitive customer information within the web server's document tree. These files are subsequently indexed by search engines.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure file permissions:** The shopping carts create files containing sensitive data (customer names, credit card numbers, addresses, phone numbers, order details, payment amounts) with world-readable permissions.
    - **Storage of sensitive data in easily accessible locations:** These files are stored within the web server's document tree, making them directly accessible via HTTP.
    - **Lack of awareness:** Both vendors and users are often unaware of the security implications of storing sensitive data in this manner, and fail to implement proper access controls.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can easily locate these files using search engines and obtain complete customer information, potentially enabling identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities. One specific site had enough data to allow a thief to "live like a king".
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Search engine indexing:** Attackers utilize search engines to discover the exposed files.
    - **Web access:** Once found, these files can be accessed directly via HTTP by anyone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - **Basic search engine skills:** Ability to use search engines with some knowledge of shopping cart file structure is required to find the files.
    - **Internet access:** Ability to access the exposed files through the web.
