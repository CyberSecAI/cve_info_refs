- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect handling of route pointers in IP packets when source routing is disabled, allowing it to be bypassed. Specifically, by including a specific type of incorrect information within the route pointer in the data packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the flawed implementation of the source routing disable feature in Windows 95, 98, and Windows NT 4.0. Even when source routing is disabled, an attacker can bypass it.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation allows an attacker to perform source routing even when it is supposed to be disabled. This can be used to bypass network security measures and potentially access internal networks.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted IP packets with a manipulated route pointer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable machine, and to forge the IP packets to include the malicious route information.
