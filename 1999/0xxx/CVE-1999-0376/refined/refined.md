The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-006) that directly relates to CVE-1999-0376.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause lies in the default access control settings of the KnownDLLs list in Windows NT. This list, which helps locate shared system DLLs in memory, allows all users to read and write to it by default.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is that the KnownDLLs list, which should be protected, is writable by all users. This allows a non-privileged user to manipulate this list.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A user can achieve privilege elevation by loading a malicious DLL with the same name as a system DLL. By modifying the KnownDLLs list to point to this malicious DLL, subsequent calls to the original system DLL will be redirected to the malicious one. When a program with high privileges calls the malicious DLL, the attacker can perform arbitrary actions, including adding the malicious user to the Administrators group. The scope of privilege elevation depends on the targeted machine (e.g., local admin on a workstation, domain admin on a domain controller).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a user with the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.
- The attack requires a malicious DLL that mimics the name of a system DLL to be loaded into memory.
- The user then programmatically modifies the KnownDLLs list.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log onto the system interactively or execute code on the system (as is the case with users that can submit arbitrary programs for execution).
- The attacker does not require administrative privileges initially.
