The content describes a vulnerability in various commercial and freeware shopping carts where they create world-readable files containing sensitive customer information within the web server's document tree.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect installation or amateur configuration of shopping cart software leading to the creation of world-readable files containing sensitive data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** World-readable files containing customer data (name, credit card numbers, addresses, phone numbers, order details, etc.) stored within the web server's document root.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive customer information, potentially leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities. An attacker could potentially gain enough data to "live like a king" as described in the content.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can discover these vulnerable files using search engines and knowledge of shopping cart file structures.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers only need access to a search engine and some basic knowledge of common shopping cart software file structures. The files are world-readable so there is no need for privilege access to the server.
