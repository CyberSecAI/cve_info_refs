- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the FTP PASV (Passive) mode, where the server opens a data port and any client can connect to this port, not just the legitimate client that initiated the PASV request.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Lack of authentication on the data connection in PASV mode. The server does not verify if the client connecting to the data port is the same client that initiated the PASV command.
  - Predictable port allocation by servers, making it easier for malicious clients to guess the port number used for the data connection.
  - The PASV response provides the IP and port to any requesting client, without validation if the client should be receiving that information.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - **Data loss/corruption:** A rogue client can connect to the data port before the legitimate client and potentially receive or corrupt the data.
  - **Denial of service (DoS):** A rogue client connecting first to the data port can prevent the legitimate client from receiving data, resulting in a denial of service.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - A rogue client monitors network traffic or repeatedly samples PASV responses to predict the port number allocated for the data connection.
  - The rogue client then connects to the data port before the legitimate client, intercepting the data or disrupting the data transfer.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be on the network and able to communicate with the FTP server.
  - The attacker needs to be able to send FTP commands (PASV, etc.) to the server.
  - The attacker needs to be able to predict or obtain the data port number opened by the server in PASV mode, and connect to it.
