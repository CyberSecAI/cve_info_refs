Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-1999-0898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from unchecked buffers in certain APIs of the Windows NT 4.0 print spooler subsystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:**  Providing a specially-malformed argument to the affected APIs can trigger a classic buffer overrun.
*   **Unchecked Buffers:**  The APIs lack proper input validation, allowing for the potential to crash the print spooler service with random data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending random data to the vulnerable APIs can crash the print spooler service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting the buffer overflow allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable calls can be made remotely.
*   **Local:** While most vulnerable APIs require elevated privileges (Power Users or Administrators), at least one is callable by normal users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote access:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
*   **User account:** While some APIs require elevated privileges (Power Users or Administrators), at least one is accessible to normal users. Anonymous users cannot exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document clearly states that the vulnerability is a result of unchecked buffers in the print spooler subsystem.
*   It provides links to patches for the vulnerability.
*   It acknowledges the discovery of the vulnerability by the eEye Digital Security Team.
*   The provided document also mentions a second vulnerability (CVE-1999-0899) related to incorrect permissions on print provider code but that vulnerability is unrelated to the CVE being evaluated.
