- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Microsoft Access 97 stores database passwords in plaintext within foreign MDB table attachments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is the storage of database passwords in an unencrypted format (plaintext). This allows for easy retrieval of the password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the database password, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the protected MDB database. This access could lead to viewing database objects, revealing other database connection strings, proprietary source code, and tampering of data.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local file access. An attacker needs access to the second MDB file (the one containing linked tables) to extract the password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the linked MDB file, and the ability to execute command-line tools like "strings" and "grep" or equivalent utilities to search the file's contents.
