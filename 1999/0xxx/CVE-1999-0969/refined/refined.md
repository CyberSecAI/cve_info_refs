- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how Windows NT processes bad Remote Procedure Call (RPC) datagrams. Specifically, the RPC service does not properly validate the return address of incoming RPC datagrams.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of the source address in RPC datagrams. This allows an attacker to spoof the source address, making it appear as if a bad RPC datagram came from another server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. The spoofed RPC datagrams cause two servers to enter an infinite loop of sending RPC error messages to each other. This loop can cause high CPU utilization (up to 100%) on the affected servers and consume excessive network bandwidth, until the bad packets are dropped.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker sends spoofed RPC datagrams to UDP destination port 135 of target Windows NT servers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets with a spoofed source IP address to the target servers. They also need to know the address of at least two servers to cause the error loop.
