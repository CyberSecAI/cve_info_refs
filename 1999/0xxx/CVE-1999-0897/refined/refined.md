- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The iChat ROOMS server does not properly sanitize user-supplied URLs, allowing directory traversal attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The server is vulnerable to directory traversal through the use of `../` sequences in the URL path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server that the user `nobody` has access to. This could include system configuration files, user data, or other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests. An attacker sends a crafted URL to the server including directory traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be in any location with network access to the vulnerable iChat server. No specific user privileges are required as the server runs as user `nobody`.
