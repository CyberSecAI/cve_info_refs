# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-016 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Malformed Phonebook Entry" Vulnerability

Published: May 19, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** May 20, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® remote access service (RAS) client. The vulnerability could allow a denial-of-service attack to be mounted against the client machine or, under certain conditions, could allow arbitrary code to be executed on it.

A fully supported patch is available that eliminates this vulnerability, and Microsoft recommends that affected customers download and install it, if appropriate.

**Issue**

The component of the RAS client that processes phonebook entries has an unchecked buffer. This results in a vulnerability that poses two threats to safe operation. The first is a denial of service threat; a malformed phonebook entry could overflow the buffer, causing the RAS client service to crash. The second is more esoteric and would be far more difficult to exploit. A carefully-constructed phonebook entry could cause arbitrary code to execute on the client via a classic buffer overrun technique. Neither variant could be exploited accidentally.

It is important to stress that the vulnerability affects RAS client machines, not RAS servers, and that the user must have permission to add or modify phonebook entries in order to mount the attack. (Permissions can be set via the phonebook's ACL). The machines primarily at risk from this vulnerability are workstations that are configured to dial out to other systems, because servers, including terminal servers, are not typically configured to act as RAS clients. It also is important to note that this vulnerability would affect only the local machine; there is no capability to directly attack a remote machine via this vulnerability.

While there are no reports of customers being adversely affected by this vulnerability, Microsoft is proactively releasing this patch to allow customers to take appropriate action to protect themselves against it.

* Microsoft Windows NT 4.0

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0715](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0715)
