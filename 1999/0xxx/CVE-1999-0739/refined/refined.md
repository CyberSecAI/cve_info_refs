The provided document contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-1999-0739.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The file viewer tools (specifically `CodeBrws.asp` in this case) included in Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) and Site Server do not restrict which files a web site visitor can view.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure file access: The file viewers allow access to arbitrary files on the server's disk partition, lacking proper access controls to restrict the files that can be viewed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: A remote attacker can view the content of files on the web server's disk partition, provided they know or can guess the file names and have sufficient access rights based on Windows NT ACLs.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: A web site visitor can access the vulnerable file viewer (`CodeBrws.asp`) through a web browser and then request to view files by specifying their paths and names.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be a remote web site visitor, and needs to know or guess the name of the files to be viewed.
- The attacker's access to the file system is limited by the standard Windows NT file permissions (ACLs).
- The file viewers can only access files on the same disk partition as the currently displayed web page.
