- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Certain versions of Microsoft Site Server and Microsoft Commercial Internet System (MCIS) do not include an expiration header when sending a web page with a Set Cookie header. This allows proxy servers to cache these pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper caching of web pages with Set-Cookie headers by proxy servers.
    - Use of GUIDs within cookies for authentication which are assumed to be unique but not secret.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If multiple users access a site through a proxy server that caches pages, they might receive the same cached page containing the same Set-Cookie header with a GUID. This can lead to one user accessing another user's data because the GUID is used as an index for the server's database.
- **Attack vectors**: A user accesses a vulnerable web server through a proxy server that caches content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any special capabilities or positioning, they just need to be an end-user accessing the vulnerable site via a proxy server.
