# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-003 - Critical

## Patch Available for IIS "Malformed FTP List Request" Vulnerability

Published: February 03, 1999 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** February 3, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the Internet Information Server FTP service. This vulnerability could allow denial of service attacks against the server or, under certain conditions, could allow arbitrary code to be executed on the server.

A fully supported fix for this problem is available. As detailed below in *What Customers Should Do*, Microsoft recommends that customers who are at risk from this vulnerability apply the patch.

**Issue**

The FTP service in IIS has an unchecked buffer in a component that processes "list" commands. This results in a vulnerability that poses two threats to safe operation. The first is a denial of service threat; a malformed "list" request could overflow the buffer causing the server to crash. The second is more esoteric and would be far more difficult to exploit. A carefully-constructed "list" request could cause arbitrary code to execute on the server via a classic buffer overrun technique. Neither variant could be exploited accidentally.

It is noteworthy that the "list" command is only available to users after they have authenticated to the server. As a result, only users who are authorized to use the server would be able to mount such an attack, and their presence on the server could be logged if the owner of the site chose to do so. However, many sites provide guest accounts, and this could allow a malicious user to attack the server anonymously.

Microsoft has no reports of any customers being affected by this vulnerability. However, Microsoft is proactively releasing a patch that corrects the problem.

The following software versions are affected:

* Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 and 4.0
