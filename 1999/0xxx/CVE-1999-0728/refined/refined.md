- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IOCTLs used to communicate with keyboard and mouse drivers in Windows NT did not require administrative privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unprotected IOCTLs allowed user-level programs to directly interact with the keyboard and mouse drivers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged program could disable the local mouse and keyboard on a workstation or server, and disable the console mouse and keyboard on a terminal server, resulting in a denial-of-service condition requiring a system reboot.
- **Attack vectors:** A user-level program could make legitimate calls to the keyboard and mouse drivers via IOCTLs to disable the input devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system with user-level privileges.
