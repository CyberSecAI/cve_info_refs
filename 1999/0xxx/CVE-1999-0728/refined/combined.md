# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-024 - Important

## Patch Available for "Unprotected IOCTLs" Vulnerability

Published: July 06, 1999 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** July 06, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability that could allow denial of service attacks against a MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® workstation, server or terminal server. An unprivileged program can disable the local mouse or keyboard on a server or workstation, and disable the console mouse or keyboard on a terminal server.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-024.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-024)

**Issue**

The IOCTLs that are used to obtain services from the keyboard and mouse drivers in Windows NT do not require that the calling program have administrative privileges. A user-level program could use legitimate calls to disable the mouse and keyboard, after which the machine would need to be rebooted to restore normal service. On a terminal server, such a program could disable the keyboard and mouse on the console.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Enterprise Edition
* Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0728](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0728)
