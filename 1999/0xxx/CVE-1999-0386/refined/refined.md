The provided document is a Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-010) describing a file access vulnerability in Personal Web Server.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Personal Web Server's failure to properly handle non-standard URLs, which allows file access control to be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper URL handling
- Failure to enforce access control mechanisms when non-standard URLs are used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized reading of files on the server.
- The vulnerability does not allow for modification or deletion of files, nor does it permit the writing of new files or grant administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation involves crafting a specific non-standard URL to request a file.
- The attacker needs to know the name of the file they wish to access, or guess it correctly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- The attacker must know or guess the name of the file to be accessed.
- The affected server must be running Personal Web Server on Windows 95 or Windows 98. Windows NT installations are not affected.
