# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-022 - Important

## Patch Available for "Double Byte Code Page" Vulnerability

Published: June 24, 1999 | Updated: March 10, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information** **Updated**: March 10, 2003

**Originally Posted:** June 24, 1999

**IIS 4.0 Patch Re-released**: August 19, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Information Server that could allow a web site visitor to view the source code for selected files on the server, if the server's default language is set to Chinese, Japanese or Korean.

This patch originally was released on June 24, 1999. However, the IIS 4.0 version of the patch was found to contain a regression error. The regression error has been eliminated and the new patch is now available.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-022.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-022)

**Issue**

When IIS is run on a machine on which a double-byte character set code page is used (i.e., the default language on the server is set to Chinese, Japanese, or Korean), and a specific URL construction is used to request a file in a virtual directory, normal server-side processing is bypassed. As a result, the file is simply delivered as text to the browser, thereby allowing the source code to be viewed.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0 and 4.0, if run on a server whose default language is set to Chinese, Korean, or Japanese

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-1999-0725](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-1999-0725)

**Patch Availability**

* English: [https:](https://)
* Simplified Chinese: </https:>[https:](https://)
* Traditional Chinese: </https:>[https:](https://)
* Japanese: </https:>[https:](https://)
* Korean: </https:>[https:](https://)

  **Note**   Apply the patch corresponding to the language version of IIS, rather than the current default language on the server. For example, if you have the English version of IIS but have reset the default language on the server to Chinese, apply the English patch.
