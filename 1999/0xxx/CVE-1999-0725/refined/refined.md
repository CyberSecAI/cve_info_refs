- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When IIS is run on a machine with a double-byte character set code page (Chinese, Japanese, or Korean), a specific URL construction can bypass normal server-side processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper handling of specific URL constructions when double-byte character set code pages are in use, leading to server-side processing bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability allows a web site visitor to view the source code of files on the server, exposing potentially sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**:  Crafting a specific URL to request a file in a virtual directory when the server's default language is set to Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable IIS server. The server must be configured with a default language using a double-byte character set (Chinese, Japanese, or Korean).
