- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `parse.c` of the `mutt` email client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `parse.c` file while parsing a Content-Type header. Specifically, the `while` loop that processes the content type after the '/' character does not check if `i` exceeds the buffer's boundary (`SHORT_STRING - 1`).
- **Impact of exploitation:** By sending a specially crafted email containing a long `Content-Type` header, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system of the user running `mutt`. The code execution occurs when the mailbox containing the malicious email is opened, even if the user does not view the email itself. The attacker can gain the privileges of the user running `mutt`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is an email with a crafted `Content-Type` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the victim. The attacker needs to craft an email with a malicious Content-Type header that includes shellcode, which must not contain `/`, `;`, `\n` and spaces.
