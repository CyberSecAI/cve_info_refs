- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JavaWebServer 1.1Beta for win32 incorrectly handles URLs ending with a period (.) or backslash (\) when requesting .jhtml files. Instead of processing the .jhtml file and returning the compiled HTML, the server displays the raw source code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary source code disclosure of .jhtml files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information embedded within .jhtml files, including JDBC queries, server filenames, and other server-side code.
- **Attack vectors:** By appending a period (.) or backslash (\) to a URL requesting a .jhtml file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to send a malformed HTTP request to the vulnerable server. No specific privileges or local network access is needed.
