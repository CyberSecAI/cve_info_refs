Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-1999-0738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `Code.asp` file viewer tool included in Microsoft Site Server and optionally in Internet Information Server (IIS). These tools, intended for viewing source code samples, do not properly restrict which files a web visitor can access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of File Access Restriction:** The core issue is the absence of proper checks to limit which files can be viewed using the `Code.asp` tool.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The file viewer allows unauthorized viewing of server files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Content Exposure:** An attacker could view the content of files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or other data.
*   **Limited Impact:** The vulnerability is limited to read-only access; it does not allow attackers to modify or create files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Access:** The attack vector is through a web browser accessing the vulnerable file viewer tool (`Code.asp`).
*   **Direct File Access:** The attacker must directly request the `Code.asp` file and provide the name of the file they wish to view as a parameter to the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web server hosting the vulnerable file viewer.
*   **Knowledge or Guessing of File Names:** The attacker must know or be able to guess the names of the files they want to view, and they must have access rights based on Windows NT ACLs.
*   **Read permissions through Windows ACLs:** The file viewers are subject to normal Windows NT file permission ACLs. A web site visitor could only use the file viewers to read files for which they have read access.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple file viewers, including `ShowCode.asp`, `ViewCode.asp`, `Code.asp`, and `CodeBrws.asp`.
*   The file viewers are not installed by default in IIS but are in Site Server.
*   The viewers are limited to files on the same disk partition as the displayed webpage.
*   Microsoft released patches to address the issue.
*   WebTrends discovered and reported the vulnerability.
