## SGI IRIX df buffer overflow in directory argument

#### Vulnerability Note VU#20851

Original Release Date: 2000-12-15 | Last Revised: 2000-12-15

---

### Overview

### Description

| The df program is used to display statistics about the amount of used and free disc space on a set of mounted file systems. Alternately, it can be used to check on the amount of space available on unmounted block devices which may be specified by some path.Due to insufficient bounds checking on either directory or block device arguments which are supplied by users, it is possible to overwrite the internal stack space of the df program while it is executing. By supplying a carefully designed argument to the df program, intruders may be able to force df to execute arbitrary code. Since df is setuid root, this will allow intruders to run arbitrary code with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| This vulnerability may allow local users to gain root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply the patched provided by SGI. |
| --- |

| 1. Remove setuid perms, and execute perms from df.  % chmod u-s `which df`2. Use the AUSCERT wrapperThe source for the wrapper, including installation instructions, canbe found at:ftp://ftp.auscert.org.au/pub/auscert/tools/overflow\_wrapper/overflow\_wrapper.cAn extract from AA-97.19.IRIX.df.buffer.overflow.vul:This wrapper replaces the df program and checks the length of the command line arguments which are passed to it.  If an argument exceeds a certain predefined value (MAXARGLEN), the wrapper exits without executing the df command.  The wrapper program can also be configured to syslog any failed attempts to execute df with arguments exceeding MAXARGLEN.  For further instructions on using this wrapper, please read the comments at the top of overflow\_wrapper.c. When compiling overflow\_wrapper.c for use with df, AUSCERT recommends defining MAXARGLEN to be 32. |

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
