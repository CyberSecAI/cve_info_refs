# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-026 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Malformed Dialer Entry" Vulnerability

Published: July 29, 1999 | Updated: March 21, 2003

**Version:** 2.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** March 21, 2003

**Originally Posted:** July 29, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the Phone Dialer accessory in MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ®. The vulnerability could be used to run arbitrary code in a user's security context on Windows NT systems.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-026.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-026)

**Issue**

Dialer.exe has an unchecked buffer in the portion of the program that processes the dialer.ini file. This vulnerability could be used to run arbitrary code via a classic buffer overrun technique.

The circumstances of this vulnerability require a fairly complicated attack scenario that limits its scope. Dialer.exe runs in the security context of the user, so it would not benefit an attacker to simply modify a dialer.ini file and run it, as he or she would not gain additional privileges. Instead, the attacker would need to modify the dialer.ini file of another user who had higher privileges, then wait for that user to run Dialer.

Although the unchecked buffer is present in all versions of Windows NT 4.0, the attack scenario would result in workstations that have dial-out capability being chiefly at risk. The FAQ discusses this in greater detail.
