- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer exists in the Phone Dialer accessory (dialer.exe) when processing the dialer.ini file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the security context of the user running the Dialer application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker modifies the dialer.ini file, specifically the portion processed by dialer.exe, with a buffer overflow payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to modify the dialer.ini file of another user, especially a user with higher privileges, and wait for that user to execute dialer.exe. This attack is more likely to affect systems with dial-out capabilities.
